PART

Chapter
1
Happy
families
are
all
alike;
every
unhappy
family
is
unhappy
in
its
own
way.
Everything
was
in
confusion
in
the
Obninsk's
house.
The
wife
had
discovered
that
the
husband
was
carrying
on
an
intrigue
with
a
French
girl,
who
had
been
a
governess
in
their
family,
and
she
had
announced
to
her
husband
that
she
could
not
go
on
living
in
the
same
house
with
him.
This
position
of
affairs
had
now
lasted
three
days,
and
not
only
the
husband
and
wife
themselves,
but
all
the
members
of
their
family
and
household,
were
painfully
conscious
of
it.
Every
person
in
the
house
felt
that
there
was
no
sense
in
their
living
together,
and
that
the
stray
people
brought
together
by
chance
in
any
inn
had
more
in
common
with
one
another
than
they,
the
members
of
the
family
and
household
of
the
Obninsk's
The
wife
did
not
leave
her
own
room,
the
husband
had
not
been
at
home
for
three
days.
The
children
ran
wild
all
over
the
house;
the
English
governess
quarreled
with
the
housekeeper,
and
wrote
to
a
friend
asking
her
to
look
out
for
a
new
situation
for
her;
the
man-eating
had
walked
off
the
day
before
just
at
dinner
time;
the
kitchen-sink,
and
the
coachman,
had
given
warning.
Three
days
after
the
quarrel,
Prince
Stepan
Arkalyk
Obninsk's
as
he
was
called
in
the
fashionable
world-amid
up
at
his
usual
hour,
that
is,
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning,
not
in
his
wife's
bedroom,
but
on
the
leather-goods
sofa
in
his
study.
He
turned
over
his
stout,
well-chosen
person
on
the
springy
sofa,
as
though
he
would
sink
into
a
long
sleep
again;
he
vigorously
embraced
the
pillow
on
the
other
side
and
buried
his
face
in
it;
but
all
at
once
he
jumped
up,
sat
up
on
the
sofa,
and
opened
his
eyes.
"Yes,
yes,
how
was
it
now?"
he
thought,
going
over
his
dream.
"Now,
how
was
it?
To
be
sure"
Alabiso
was
giving
a
dinner
at
Darod
no,
not
Darod
but
something
American.
Yes,
but
then,
Darmstadt
was
in
America.
Yes,
Alabiso
was
giving
a
dinner
on
glass
tables,
and
the
tables
sang,
_Immediately
mio
null
_Immediately
mio
null
though,
but
something
better,
and
there
were
some
sort
of
little
decanters
on
the
table,
and
they
were
women,
too,"
he
remembered.
Stepan
Arkalyk
eyes
twinkled
gain
and
he
pondered
with
a
smile.
"Yes,
it
was
nice,
very
nice.
There
was
a
great
deal
more
that
was
delightful,
only
there's
no
putting
it
into
words,
or
even
expressing
it
in
one's
thoughts
awake:
And
noticing
a
gleam
of
light
peeping
in
beside
one
of
the
serge
curtains,
he
cheerfully
dropped
his
feet
over
the
edge
of
the
sofa,
and
felt
about
with
them
for
his
slippers,
a
present
on
his
last
birthday,
worked
for
him
by
his
wife
on
gold-colored
moron
And,
as
he
had
done
every
day
for
the
last
nine
years,
he
stretched
out
his
hand,
without
getting
up,
towards
the
place
where
his
dressing-gowned
always
hung
in
his
bedroom.
And
thereupon
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
was
not
sleeping
in
his
wife's
room,
but
in
his
study,
and
why:
the
smile
vanished
from
his
face,
he
knitted
his
brows.
"Ah,
ah,
ah'm
Oo,
he
muttered,
recalling
everything
that
had
happened.
And
again
every
detail
of
his
quarrel
with
his
wife
was
present
to
his
imagination,
all
the
hopelessness
of
his
position,
and
worst
of
all,
his
own
fault.
"Yes,
she
won't
forgive
me,
and
she
can't
forgive
me.
And
the
most
awful
thing
about
it
is
that
it's
all
my
fault-free
my
fault,
though
I'm
not
to
blame.
That's
the
point
of
the
whole
situation,"
he
reflected.
"Oh,
oh,
oh,
he
kept
repeating
in
despair,
as
he
remembered
the
acutely
painful
sensations
caused
him
by
this
quarrel.
Most
unpleasant
of
all
was
the
first
minute
when,
on
coming,
happy
and
good-humoured
from
the
theater,
with
a
huge
pear
in
his
hand
for
his
wife,
he
had
not
found
his
wife
in
the
drawing-rooms.
to
his
surprise
had
not
found
her
in
the
study
either,
and
saw
her
at
last
in
her
bedroom
with
the
unlucky
letter
that
revealed
everything
in
her
hand.
She,
his
Dolly,
forever
fussing
and
worrying
over
household
details,
and
limited
in
her
ideas,
as
he
considered,
was
sitting
perfectly
still
with
the
letter
in
her
hand,
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
of
horror,
despair,
and
indignation.
"What's
this?
this?"
she
asked,
pointing
to
the
letter.
And
at
this
recollection,"
Stepan
Arkalyk
as
is
so
often
the
case,
was
not
so
much
annoyed
at
the
fact
itself
as
at
the
way
in
which
he
had
met
his
wife's
words.
There
happened
to
him
at
that
instant
what
does
happen
to
people
when
they
are
unexpectedly
caught
in
something
very
disgraceful.
He
did
not
succeed
in
adapting
his
face
to
the
position
in
which
he
was
placed
towards
his
wife
by
the
discovery
of
his
fault.
Instead
of
being
hurt,
denying,
defending
himself,
begging
forgiveness,
instead
of
remaining
indifferent
even-handed
would
have
been
better
than
what
he
did
do-able
face
utterly
involuntarily
(reform
spinal
action,
reflected
Stepan
Arkalyk
who
was
fond
of
physiology,
involuntarily
assumed
its
habitual,
good-humoured
and
therefore
idiotic
smile.
This
idiotic
smile
he
could
not
forgive
himself.
Catching
sight
of
that
smile,
Dolly
shuddered
as
though
at
physical
pain,
broke
out
with
her
characteristic
heat
into
a
flood
of
cruel
words,
and
rushed
out
of
the
room.
Since
then
she
had
refused
to
see
her
husband.
"It's
that
idiotic
smile
that's
to
blame
for
it
all,"
thought
Stepan
Arkalyk
"But
what's
to
be
done?
What's
to
be
done?"
he
said
to
himself
in
despair,
and
found
no
answer.
Chapter
2
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
a
truthful
man
in
his
relations
with
himself.
He
was
incapable
of
deceiving
himself
and
persuading
himself
that
he
repented
of
his
conduct.
He
could
not
at
this
date
repent
of
the
fact
that
he,
a
handsome,
susceptible
man
of
thirty-minute
was
not
in
love
with
his
wife,
the
mother
of
five
living
and
two
dead
children,
and
only
a
year
younger
than
himself.
All
he
repented
of
was
that
he
had
not
succeeded
better
in
hiding
it
from
his
wife.
But
he
felt
all
the
difficulty
of
his
position
and
was
sorry
for
his
wife,
his
children,
and
himself.
Possibly
he
might
have
managed
to
conceal
his
sins
better
from
his
wife
if
he
had
anticipated
that
the
knowledge
of
them
would
have
had
such
an
effect
on
her.
He
had
never
clearly
thought
out
the
subject,
but
he
had
vaguely
conceived
that
his
wife
must
long
ago
have
suspected
him
of
being
unfaithful
to
her,
and
shut
her
eyes
to
the
fact.
He
had
even
supposed
that
she,
a
worn-out
woman
no
longer
young
or
good-luck
and
in
no
way
remarkable
or
interesting,
merely
a
good
mother,
ought
from
a
sense
of
fairness
to
take
an
indulgent
view.
It
had
turned
out
quite
the
other
way.
"Oh,
it's
awful!
oh
dear,
oh
dear,
null
Stepan
Arkalyk
kept
repeating
to
himself,
and
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
be
done.
"And
how
well
things
were
going
up
till
now!
how
well
we
got
on!"
She
was
contented
and
happy
in
her
children;
I
never
interfered
with
her
in
anything;
I
let
her
manage
the
children
and
the
house
just
as
she
liked.
It's
true
it's
bad
_in
having
been
a
governess
in
our
house.
That's
bad"
There's
something
common,
vulgar,
in
flirting
with
one's
governess.
But
what
a
governess,
(He
vividly
recalled
the
roguish
black
eyes
of
Mlodych
Roland
and
her
smile:
"But
after
all,
while
she
was
in
the
house,
I
kept
myself
in
hand.
And
the
worst
of
it
all
is
that
she's
already
...
it
seems
as
if
ill-mannered
would
have
it
so"
Oh,
oh,
But
what,
what
is
to
be
done?"
There
was
no
solution,
but
that
universal
solution
which
life
gives
to
all
questions,
even
the
most
complex
and
insoluble.
That
answer
is:
one
must
live
in
the
needs
of
the
day-a-year
is,
forget
oneself.
To
forget
himself
in
sleep
was
impossible
now,
at
least
till
nightwatchman,
he
could
not
go
back
now
to
the
music
sung
by
the
decanters
so
he
must
forget
himself
in
the
dream
of
daily
life.
"Then
we
shall
see,"
Stepan
Arkalyk
said
to
himself,
and
getting
up
he
put
on
a
gray
dressing-gowned
lined
with
blue
silk,
tied
the
tassels
in
a
knot.
and,
drawing
a
deep
breath
of
air
into
his
broad,
bare
chest,
he
walked
to
the
window
with
his
usual
confident
step,
turning
out
his
feet
that
carried
his
full
frame
so
easily.
He
pulled
up
the
blind
and
rang
the
bell
loudly.
It
was
at
once
answered
by
the
appearance
of
an
old
friend,
his
valet,
Matveyev
carrying
his
clothes,
his
boots,
and
a
telegram.
Matvey
was
followed
by
the
barber
with
all
the
necessarilly
for
shaving.
"Are
there
any
papers
from
the
office?"
asked
Stepan
Arkalyk
taking
the
telegram
and
seating
himself
at
the
looking-glasses
"On
the
table,"
replied
Matveyev
glancing
with
inquiring
sympathy
at
his
masterclass
and,
after
a
short
pause,
he
added
with
a
sly
smile,
"They've
sent
from
the
carriage.
Stepan
Arkalyk
made
no
reply,
he
merely
glanced
at
Matvey
in
the
looking-glasses
In
the
glance,
in
which
their
eyes
met
in
the
looking-glasses
it
was
clear
that
they
understood
one
another.
Stepan
Arkalyk
eyes
asked:
"Why
do
you
tell
me
that?
don't
you
know?"
Matvey
put
his
hands
in
his
jacket
pockets,
thrust
out
one
leg,
and
gazed
silently,
good-humoured
with
a
faint
smile,
at
his
master.
"I
told
them
to
come
on
Sunday,
and
till
then
not
to
trouble
you
or
themselves
for
nothing,"
he
said.
He
had
obviously
prepared
the
sentence
beforehand.
Stepan
Arkalyk
saw
Matvey
wanted
to
make
a
joke
and
attract
attention
to
himself.
Tearing
open
the
telegram.
he
read
it
through,
guessing
at
the
words,
misspelt
as
they
always
are
in
telegrams,
and
his
face
brightened.
"Maude"
my
sister
Anna
Arkalyk
will
be
here
tomorrow,"
he
said,
checking
for
a
minute
the
sleek,
plump
hand
of
the
barber,
cutting
a
pink
path
through
his
long,
curly
whiskey
"Thank
God!"'
said
Matveyev
showing
by
this
response
that
he,
like
his
master,
realized
the
significance
of
this
arrival.
is,
that
Anna
Arkalyk
the
sister
he
was
so
fond
of,
might
bring
about
a
reconciliation
between
husband
and
wife.
"Alone,
or
with
her

inquired
Matveyev
Stepan
Arkalyk
could
not
answer,
as
the
barber
was
at
work
on
his
upper
lip,
and
he
raised
one
finger.
Matvey
nodded
at
the
looking-glasses
"Along

repeated,
as
though
in
doubt.
"Yes,

her.

the
telegrams

it
to
her,
and
then
do
what
she
tells
you."
"You
want
to
try
it
on,"
Matvey
understood,
but
he
only
said,
"Yes
sir."
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
already
washed
and
combed
and
ready
to
be
dressed,
when
Matveyev
stepping
deliberately
in
his
creaky
boots,
came
back
into
the
room
with
the
telegram
in
his
hand.
The
barber
had
gone.
"Das
Alexei
told
me
to
inform
you
that

is

away.

he
said,
laughing
only
with
his
eyes,
and
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets,
he
watched
his
master
with
his
head
on
one
side.
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
silent
a
minute.
Then
a
good-humored
and
rather
pitiful
smile
showed
itself
on
his
handsome
face.
"Eight
Matveyev
he
said,
shaking
his
head.
"It's
all
right,
sir?
she
will
come
round,"
said
Matveyev
"Come
round?)
"Yes,
sir."
"Do
you
think
so?
Who's
there?"
asked
Stepan
Arkalyk
hearing
the
rustle
of
a
woman's
dress
at
the
door.
"It's
I,"
said
a
firm,
pleasant,
woman's
voice,
and
the
stern,
pockmarked
face
of
Matrouh,
Philinte,
the
nurse,
was
thrust
in
at
the
doorway.
"Well,
what
is
it,
Matrouh,
queried
Stepan
Arkalyk
going
up
to
her
at
the
door.
Although
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
completely
in
the
wrong
as
regards
his
wife,
and
was
conscious
of
this
himself,
almost
every
one
in
the
house
(even
the
nurse,

ally,
was
on
his
side.

"Come,

said
Stepan
Arkalyk
blushing
suddenly.
"Well
now,
do
dress
me."
He
turned
to
Matvey
and
threw
off
his
dressing-gowned
decisively.
Matvey
was
already
holding
up
the
shirt
like
a
horse's
collar,
and,
blowing
off
some
invisible
specked
he
slipped
it
with
obvious
pleasure
over
the
well-groomed
body
of
his
master.
Chapter
3
When
he
was
dressed,
Stepan
Arkalyk
sprinkled
some
scent
on
himself,
pulled
down
his
shirt-jacket
distributed
into
his
pockets
his
cigarettes,
pocketbook,
matches,
and
watch
with
its
double
chain
and
seals,
and
shaking
out
his
handkerchief.
feeling
himself
clean,
fragrant,
healthy,
and
physically
at
ease,
in
spite
of
his
unhappiness,
he
walked
with
a
slight
swing
on
each
leg
into
the
dining.
where
coffee
was
already
waiting
for
him,
and
beside
the
coffee,
letters
and
papers
from
the
office.
He
read
the
letters.
One
was
very
unpleasant,
from
a
merchant
who
was
buying
a
forest
on
his
wife's
property.
To
sell
this
forest
was
absolutely
null
but
at
present,
until
he
was
reconciled
with
his
wife,
the
subject
could
not
be
discussed.
The
most
unpleasant
thing
of
all
was
that
his
pecuniary
interests
should
in
this
way
enter
into
the
question
of
his
reconciliation
with
his
wife.
And
the
idea
that
he
might
be
led
on
by
his
interests,
that
he
might
seek
a
reconciliation
with
his
wife
on
account
of
the
sale
of
the
forest-industry
idea
hurt
him.
When
he
had
finished
his
letters,
Stepan
Arkalyk
moved
the
office-product
close
to
him,
rapidly
looked
through
two
pieces
of
business,
made
a
few
notes
with
a
big
pencil,
and
pushing
away
the
papers,
turned
to
his
coffee.
As
he
sipped
his
coffee,
he
opened
a
still
damp
morning
paper,
and
began
reading
it.
Stepan
Arkalyk
took
in
and
read
a
liberal
paper,
not
an
extreme
one,
but
one
advocating
the
views
held
by
the
majority.
And
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
science,
art,
and
politics
had
no
special
interest
for
him,
he
firmly
held
those
views
on
all
these
subjects
which
were
held
by
the
majority
and
by
his
paper,
and
he
only
changed
them
when
the
majority
changed
them.
more
strictly
speaking,
he
did
not
change
them,
but
they
imperceptibly
changed
of
themselves
within
him.
Stepan
Arkalyk
had
not
chosen
his
political
opinions
or
his
views;
these
political
opinions
and
views
had
come
to
him
of
themselves,
just
as
he
did
not
choose
the
shapes
of
his
hat
and
coat,
but
simply
took
those
that
were
being
worn.
And
for
him,
living
in
a
certain
society-sponsored
to
the
need,
ordinarily
developed
at
years
of
discretion,
for
some
degree
of
mental
activity-based
have
views
was
just
as
indispensable
as
to
have
a
hat.
If
there
was
a
reason
for
his
preferring
liberal
to
conservative
views,
which
were
held
also
by
many
of
his
circle,
it
arose
not
from
his
considering
liberalism
more
rational,
but
from
its
being
in
closer
accordance
with
his
manner
of
life.
The
liberal
party
said
that
in
Russia
everything
is
wrong,
and
certainly
Stepan
Arkalyk
had
many
debts
and
was
decidedly
short
of
money.
The
liberal
party
said
that
marriage
is
an
institution
quite
out
of
date,
and
that
it
needs
reconstructions
and
family
life
certainly
afforded
Stepan
Arkalyk
little
gratification,"
and
forced
him
into
lying
and
hypocrisy,
which
was
so
repulsive
to
his
nature.
The
liberal
party
said,
or
rather
allowed
it
to
be
understood,
that
religion
is
only
a
curb
to
keep
in
check
the
barbarous
classes
of
the
people;
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
could
not
get
through
even
a
short
service
without
his
legs
aching
from
standing
up,
and
could
never
make
out
what
was
the
object
of
all
the
terrible
and
high-flown
language
about
another
world
when
life
might
be
so
very
amusing
in
this
world.
And
with
all
this,
Stepan
Arkalyk
who
liked
a
joke,
was
fond
of
puzzling
a
plain
man
by
saying
that
if
he
prided
himself
on
his
origin,
he
ought
not
to
stop
at
Ruritanian
and
disown
the
first
founder
of
his
family-advice
monkey.
And
so
Liberalize
had
become
a
habit
of
Stepan
Arkalyk
and
he
liked
his
newspaper,
as
he
did
his
cigar
after
dinner,
for
the
slight
fog
it
diffused
in
his
brain.
He
read
the
leading
article,
in
which
it
was
maintained
that
it
was
quite
senseless
in
our
day
to
raise
an
outcry
that
radicalism
was
threatening
to
swallow
up
all
conservative
elements,
and
that
the
government
ought
to
take
measures
to
crush
the
revolutionary
hydrant
that,
on
the
contrary,
"in
our
opinion
the
danger
lies
not
in
that
fantastic
revolutionary
hydrant
but
in
the
obstinacy
of
traditionalism.
clogging
progress,"
etc.,
etc.
He
read
another
article,
too,
a
financial
one,
which
alluded
to
Bentham,
and
Mill,
and
dropped
some
innuendoes
reflecting
on
the
ministry.
With
his
characteristic
quicky
he
caught
the
drift
of
each
innuendo.

whence
it
came,
at
whom
and
on
what
ground
it
was
aimed,
and
that
afforded
him,
as
it
always
did,
a
certain
satisfaction.
But
today
that
satisfaction

and
the
unsatisfactory
state
of
the
household.
He
read,
too,
that
Count
Bek-Nielsen
was
rumored
to
have

for
Wiesbaden,
and
that
one

more

and
of
the
sale
of
a
light
carriage,
and
of
a
young
person
seeking
a
situation;
but
these
items
of
information
did
not
give
him,
as
usual,
a
quiet,
ironical
gratification.
Having
finished
the
paper,
a
second
cup
of
coffee
and
a
roll
and
butter,
he
got
up,
shaking
the
crumbs
of
the
roll
off
his
waistcoats
and,
squaring
his
broad
chest,
he
smiled
joyride
not
because
there
was
anything
particularly
agreeable
in
his
mind-altering
joyous
smile
was
evoked
by
a
good
digestion.
But
this
joyous
smile
at
once
recalled
everything
to
him,
and
he
grew
thoughtful.
Two
childish
voices
(Stephen
Arkalyk
recognized
the
voices
of
Grisham
his
youngest
boy,
and
Tanya,
his
eldest
girl,
were
heard
outside
the
door.
They
were
carrying
something,
and
dropped
it.
"I
told
you
not

said
the

"there,

"Everything's

thought
Stepan
Arkalyk
"there

about

And
going
to
the
door,
he
called
them.
They
threw
down
the
box,
that
represented
a
train,
and
came
in
to
their
father.
The
little
girl,
her
father's
favorite,
ran
up
boldly,
embraced
him,
and
hung
laughingly
on
his
neck,
enjoying

she
always
did

back.
"How

he
asked,
passing
his
hand
over
his
daughter's
smooth,
soft
little
neck.
"Good
morning,"
he
said,
smiling
to
the
boy,
who
had
come
up
to
greet
him.
He
was
conscious
that
he
loved
the
boy
less,
and
always
tried
to
be
fair;
but
the
boy
felt
it,
and
did
not
respond
with
a
smile
to
his
father's
chilly
smile.
"Mammals"
She

answered
the
girl.
Stepan
Arkalyk
sighed.
"That

that
she's

he
thought.
"Well,

null
The
little
girl
knew
that
there
was
a
quarrel
between
her
father
and
mother,
and
that
her
mother
could
not
be
cheerful,
and
that
her
father
must
be
aware
of
this,
and
that
he
was
pretending
when
he
asked
about
it
so
lightly.
And
she
blushed
for
her
father.
He
at
once
perceived
it,
and
blushed
too.
"I

she
said.
"She

the

"Yes,

And
still
stroking

kissed
her
on
the

her

and
let
her
go.

Stepan
Arkalyk
as
he
generally
did,
made
her

down,
heard

to
the

attentively
without
interrupting
her,
and
gave
her
detailed
advice
as
to
how
and
to

and
even
wrote
her,

sprawling,
good
and
legible
hand,
a
confident
and
fluent
little
note
to
a
personal
who
might
be
of
use
to
her.
Having
got
rid
of
the
staff
captain's
widow,
Stepan
Arkalyk
took
his
hat
and
stopped
to
recollect
whether
he
had
forgotten
anything.
It
appeared
that
he
had
forgotten
nothing
except
what
he
wanted
to
forget-me-not
wife.
"Ah,
yes!"
He
bowed
his
head,
and
his
handsome
face
assumed
a
harassed
expression.
"To
go,
or
not
to
go!"
he
said
to
himself;
and
an
inner
voice
told
him
he
must
not
go,
that

Except

and

nothing
could
come
of

and
deceit

were
opposed
to

"It

he
said,
trying
to
give
himself

once
luxuriant
and

fastened
up
with
hairs
on
the
naphta
of
her

with
a
sunless
thin
face
and
large,
startled

which
looked
prominent
from
the
thinness
of
her
face,
was
standing
among
a
litter
of
all
sorts
of
things
scattered
all
over
the
room,
before
an
open
bureau,
from
which
she
was
taking
something.
Hearing
her
husband's
steps,
she
stopped,
looking
towards
the
door,
and
trying
assiduously
to
give
her
features
a
severe
and
contemptuous
expression.
She
felt
she
was
afraid
of
him,
and
afraid
of
the
coming
interview.
She
was
just
attempting
to
do
what
she
had
attempted
to
do
ten
times
already
in
these
last
three
days-at-sea

the
children's
things
and

again
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
do
this;
but
now
again,
as
each
time
before,
she
kept
saying
to
herself,
"that
things
cannot
go
on
like
this,
that
she
must
take
some
step"
to
punish
him,
put
him
to
shame,
avenge
on
him
some
little
part
at
least
of
the
suffering
he
had
caused
her.
She
still
continued
to
tell
herself
that
she
should
leave
him,
but
she
was
conscious
that
this
was
impossible;
it
was
impossible
because
she
could
not
get
out
of
the
habit
of
regarding
him
as
her
husband
and
loving
him.
Besides
this,
she
realized
that
if
even
here
in
her
own
house
she
could
hardly
manage
to
look
after
her
five
children
properly,
they
would
be
still
worse
off
where
she
was
going
with
them
all.
As
it
was,
even
in
the
course
of
these
three
days,
the
youngest
was
unwell
from
being
given
unwholesome
soup,
and
the
others
had
almost
gone
without
their
dinner
the
day
before.
She
was
conscious
that
it
was
impossible
to
go
away;
but,
cheating
herself,
she
went
on
all
the
same
sorting
out
her
things
and
pretending
she
was
going.
Seeing
her
husband,
she
dropped
her
hands
into
the
drawer
of
the
bureau
as
though
looking
for
something,
and
only
looked
round
at
him
when
he
had
come
quite
up
to
her.
But
her
face,
to
which
she
tried
to
give
a
severe
and
resolute
expression,
betrayed
bewilderment
and
suffering.
"Dolly's
he
said
in
a
subdued
and
timid
voice.
He
bent
his
head
towards
his
shoulder
and
tried
to
look
pitiful
and
humble,
but
for
all
that
he
was
radiant
with
freshness
and
health.
In
a
rapid
glance
she
scanned
his
figure
that
beamed
with
health
and
freshness.
"Yes,

she
thought.
Her

stiffened,
the
muscles

contracted
on
the
right
side
of
her
pale,
nervous
face.
"What
do

she
said
in
a
rapid,
deep,
unnatural
voice.
"Dolly's

repeated,
with
a
quiver
in
his
voice.
"Anna

"Well,

but
when
he
saw
her
tortured,
suffering
face,
heard
the
tone
of
her
voice,
submissive
to
fate
and
full
of
despair,
there
was
a
catch
in
his
breath
and
a
lump
in
his
throat,
and
his
eyes
began
to
shine
with
tears.
"My

could
not

was

dropped

him
in
some
way
or

would
have

at

as
at
a

of

pain,
her
lips
stiffened
again,
and
again
the
muscles
of
her
right
cheek
worked.
"Go

she
shrieked

She
tried
to
go
out,
but
tottered,

clung
to
the
back
of
a
chair
to
support
herself.
His
face
relaxed,
his
lips
swelled,
his
eyes
were
swimming
with
tears.
"Dolly's

said,
sobbing
now;
"for

She
sat
down.
He
listened
to
her
hard,
heavy
breathing,
and
he
was
unuusal
sorry
for
her.
She
tried
several
times
to
begin
to

could
not.
He
waited.

repeated,
raising
her
voice,
"after

kept

With
pain
and
wrath
she
uttered
the
word
so
terrible
to
herself.
He
looked
at
her,
and
the
fury
expressed
in
her
face
alarmed
and
amazed
him.
He
did
not
understand
how
his
pity
for
her
exasperated
her.
She
saw
in
him
sympathy
for
her,
but
not

"No,
she
hates
me.
She
will
not
forgive
me,"
he
thought.
"It
is
awful!
null
he
said.
At
that
moment
in
the
next
room
a
child
began
to
cry?"
probably
it
had
fallen
down.
Darya
Alexei
listened,
and
her
face
suddenly
softened.
She
seemed
to
be
pulling
herself
together
for
a
few
seconds,
as
though
she
did
not
know
where
she
was,
and
what
she
was
doing,
and
getting
up
rapidly,
she
moved
towards
the
door.
"Well,
she
loves
my
child,"
he
thought,
noticing
the
change
of
her
face
at
the
child's
cry,
"my
child:
how
can
she
hate
me?"
"Dolphin
one
word
more,"
he
said,
following
her.
"If
you
come

I
will

And
she
went
out,
slamming
the
door.
Stepan
Arkalyk
sighed,
wiped
his
face,
and
with
a
subdued
tread
walked
out
of
the
room.
"Maude"
says
she
will
come
round;
but
how?
I
don't
see
the
least
chance
of
it.
Ah,
oh,
how
horrible
it
is!
And
how
vulgarly
she
shouted.
he
said
to
himself,
remembering
her
shriek
and
the
words.

"mistrust,
"And
very
likely
the

were

Horrifido,

horrible,
Stepan
Arkalyk
stood
a
few
seconds
alone,
wiped
his
face,
squared
his
chest,
and
walked
out
of
the
room.
It
was
Friday,
and
in
the
dining
room
the
German
watchmaker
was
winding
up
the
clock.
Stepan
Arkalyk
remembered
his
joke
about
this
punctuality

watchmaker,
"that
the
German
was
wound
up
for
a
whole
lifetime
himself,
to
wind
up
watches,"
and
he
smiled.
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
fond
of
a
joke:
"And
maybe
she
will
come
round'
That's
a
good
expression,
'a
round-backed
he
thought.
"I
must
repeat
that."
"Maude"
he
shouted.

Darya
in
the
sitting
room
for
Anna
Arkalyk
he
said
to
Matvey
when
he
came
in.
"Yes,
sir."
Stepan
Arkalyk
put
on
his
fur
coat
and
went
out
onto
the
steps.
"You
won't
dine
at
home?"
said
Matveyev
seeing
him
off.
"That's
as
it
happens.
But
here's
for
the
housekeeping,"
he
said,
taking
ten
roubles
from
his
pocketbook.
"That'll
be
enough."
"Enough
or
not
enough,
we
must
make
it
do,"
said
Matveyev
slamming
the
carriage
door
and
stepping
back
onto
the
steps.
Darya
Alexei
meanwhile
having
pacified
the
child,
and
knowing
from
the
sound
of
the
carriage
that
he
had
gone
off,
went
back
again
to
her
bedroom.
It
was
her
solitary
refuge
from
the
household
cares
which
crowded
upon
her
directly
she
went
out
from
it.
Even
now,
in
the
short
time
she
had
been
in
the
nursery,
the
English
governess
and
Matrouh,
Philinte,
had
succeeded
in
putting
several
questions
to
her,
which
did
not
admit
of
delay,
and
which
only
she
could
answer:
"What
were
the
children
to
put
on
for
their
walkable,
Should
they
have
any
milked
Should
not
a
new
cook
be
sent
for?"
"Ah,
let
me
alone,
let
me
alone"
she
said,
and
going
back
to
her
bedroom
she
sat
down
in
the
same
place
as
she
had
sat
when
talking
to
her
husband,
clasping
tightly
her
thin
hands
with
the
rings
that
slipped
down
on
her
bony
fingers,
and
fell
to
going
over
in
her
memory
all
the
conversation.
"He
has
gone!"
But
has
he
broken
it
off
with
her?"
she
thought.
"Can
it
be
he
sees
her?
Why
didn't
I
ask
him!
No,
no,
reconciliation
is
impossible.
Even
if
we
remain
in
the
same
house,
we
are
strangers.
forever"
She
repeated
again
with
special
significance
the
word
so
dreadful
to
her.
"And
how
I
loved
him!
my
God,
how
I
loved
him"
How
I
loved
him!
And
now
don't
I
love
him?
Don't
I
love
him
more
than
before?
The
most
horrible
thing
is,"
she
began,
but
did
not
finish
her
thought,
because
Matrouh,
Philinte,
put
her
head
in
at
the
door.
"Let
us
send
for
my
brother,"
she
said;
"he
can
get
a
dinner
anyway,
or
we
shall
have
the
children
getting
nothing
to
eat
till
six
again,
like
yesterday."
"Very
well,
I
will
come
directly
and

about

And
Darya
Alexei
plunged
into
the
duties
of
the
day,
and
drowned
her
grief
in
them
for
a
time.
Chapter
5
Stepan
Arkalyk
had
learned
easily
at
school,
thanks
to
his
excellent
abilities,
but
he
had
been
idle
and
mischievous,
and
therefore
was
one
of
the
lowest
in
his
class.
But
in
spite
of
his
habitually
dissipated
mode
of
life,
his
inferior
grade
in
the
service,
and
his
comparative
youth,
he
occupied
the
honorable
and
lucrative
position
of
president
of
one
of
the
government
boards
at
Moscow.
This
post
he
had
received
through
his
sister
Anna's
husband,
Alexey
Alexei
Karenina
who
held
one
of
the
most
important
positions
in
the
ministry
to
whose
department
the
Moscow
office
belonged.
But
if
Karenina
had
not
got
his
brother-in-law
this
berth,
then
through
a
hundred
other
personal
sisters,
cousins,
uncles,
and
aunts.
Obninsk's
would
have
received
this
post,
or
some
other
similar
one,
together
with
the
salary
of
six
thousand
absolutely
needier
for
him,
as
his
affairs,
in
spite
of
his
wife's
considerable
property,
were
in
an
embarrassed
condition.
Half
Moscow
and
Petersburg
were
friends
and
relations
of
Stepan
Arkalyk
He
was
born
in
the
midst
of
those
who
had
been
and
are
the
powerful
ones
of
this
world.
One-third
of
the
men
in
the
government,
the
older
men,
had
been
friends
of
his
father's,
and
had
known
him
in
pettifogging
another
third
were
his
intimate
chums,
and
the
remainder
were
friendly
acquaintances.
Consequently
the
distributors
of
earthly
blessings
in
the
shape
of
places,
rents,
shares,
and
such,
were
all
his
friends,
and
could
not
overlook
one
of
their
own
set;
and
Obninsk's
had
no
need
to
make
any
special
exertion
to
get
a
lucrative
post.
He
had
only
not
to
refuse
things,
not
to
show
jealousy,
not
to
be
quarrelsome
or
take
offense,
all
of
which
from
his
characteristic
good
nature
he
never
did.
It
would
have
struck
him
as
absurd
if
he
had
been
told
that
he
would
not
get
a
position
with
the
salary
he
required,
especially
as
he
expected
nothing
out
of
the
way;
he
only
wanted
what
the
men
of
his
own
age
and
standing
did
get,
and
he
was
no
worse
qualified
for
performing
duties
of
the
kind
than
any
other
man.
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
not
merely
liked
by
all
who
knew
him
for
his
good
humor,
but
for
his
bright
disposition,
and
his
unquestionably
honesty.
In
him,
in
his
handsome,
radiant
figure,
his
sparkling
eyes,
black
hair
and
eyebrows,
and
the
white
and
red
of
his
face,
there
was
something
which
produced
a
physical
effect
of
kindliness
and
good
humor
on
the
people
who
met
him.
"Ahab

was
almost
always
said
with
a
smile
of
delight
on
meeting
him.
Even
though
it
happened
at
times
that
after
a
conversation
with
him
it
seemed
that
nothing
particularly
delightful
had
happened,
the
next
day,
and
the
next,
every
one
was
just
as
delighted
at
meeting
him
again.
After
filling
for
three
years
the
post
of
president
of
one
of
the
government
boards
at
Moscow,
Stepan
Arkalyk
had
won
the
respect,
as
well
as
the
liking,
of
his
fellow-passengers
subordinates,
and
superiors,
and
all
who
had
had
business
with
him.
The
principal
qualities
in
Stepan
Arkalyk
which
had
gained
him
this
universal
respect
in
the
service
consisted,
in
the
first
place,
of
his
extreme
indulgence
for
others,
founded
on
a
consciousness
of
his
own
shortcovering
secondly,
of
his
perfect
liberalism.
the
liberalism
he
read
of
in
the
papers,
but
the
liberalism
that
was
in
his
blood,
in
virtue
of
which
he
treated
all
men
perfectly
equally
and
exactly
the
same,
whatever
their
fortune
or
calling
might
be;
and
thirdquarter
most
important
point-and-shoot
complete
indifference
to
the
business
in
which
he
was
engaged,
in
consequence
of
which
he
was
never
carried
away,
and
never
made
mistakes.
On
reaching
the
offices
of
the
board,
Stepan
Arkalyk
escorted
by
a
deferential
porter
with
a
portfolio,
went
into
his
little
private
room,
put
on
his
uniform,
and
went
into
the
boardroom.
The
clerks
and
copyreader
all
rose,
greeting
him
with
good-humored
deferential
Stepan
Arkalyk
moved
quickly,
as
ever,
to
his
place,
shook
hands
with
his
colleagues,
and
sat
down.
He
made
a
joke
or
two,
and
talked
just
as
much
as
was
consistent
with
due
decorum,
and
began
work.
No
one
knew
better
than
Stepan
Arkalyk
how
to
hit
on
the
exact
line
between
freedom,
simplicity,
and
official
stiffness
necessary
for
the
agreeable
conduct
of
business.
A
secretary,
with
the
good-humored
deference
common
to
every
one
in
Stepan
Arkalyk
office,
came
up
with
papers,
and
began
to
speak
in
the
familiar
and
easy
tone
which
had
been
introduced
by
Stepan
Arkalyk
"We
have
succeeded
in
getting
the
information
from
the
government
department
of
Penzance"
Here,
would
you
null
"You've
got
them
at
last?"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
laying
his
finger
on
the
paper.
"Now,
gentlemen;
And
the
sitting
of
the
board
began.
"If
they
knew,"
he
thought,
bending
his
head
with
a
significant
air
as
he
listened
to
the
report,
"what
a
guilty
little
boy
their
president
was
half
an
hour
ago."
And
his
eyes
were
laughing
during
the
reading
of
the
report.
Till
two
o'clock
the
sitting
would
go
on
without
a
break,
and
at
two
o'clock
there
would
be
an
interval
and
luncheon.
It
was
not
yet
two,
when
the
large
glass
doors
of
the
boardroom
suddenly
opened
and
someone
came
in.
All
the
officials
sitting
on
the
further
side
under
the
portrait
of
the
Tsar
and
the
eagle,
delighted
at
any
distraction,
looked
round
at
the
door;
but
the
doorkeeper
standing
at
the
door
at
once
drove
out
the
intruder,
and
closed
the
glass
door
after
him.
When
the
case
had
been
read
through,
Stepan
Arkalyk
got
up
and
stretched,
and
by
way
of
tribute
to
the
liberalism
of
the
times
took
out
a
cigarette
in
the
boardroom
and
went
into
his
private
room.
Two
of
the
members
of
the
board,
the
old
veteran
in
the
service,
Nikitin,
and
the
_Keep
Grinevsky
went
in
with
him.
"We
shall
have
time
to
finish
after
lunch,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
"To
be
sure
we
shall,
said
Nikiya
"A
pretty
sharp
fellow
this
Fomon
must
be,"
said
Grinevsky
of
one
of
the
persons
taking
part
in
the
case
they
were
examining.
Stepan
Arkalyk
frowned
at
Grinevsky
words,
giving
him
thereby
to
understand
that
it
was
improper
to
pass
judgment
prematurely,
and
made
him
no
reply.
"Who
was
that
came
in?"
he
asked
the
doorkeepers
"Something
your
excellent
crept
in
without
permission
directly
my
back
was
turned.
He
was
asking
for
you.
I
told
him:
when
the
members
come
out,
then:
"Where
is
he?"
"Maybe
he's
gone
into
the
passage,
but
here
he
comes
anyway.
That
is
he,"
said
the
doorkeepers
pointing
to
a
strongly
built,
broad-shouldered
man
with
a
curly
beard,
who,
without
taking
off
his
sheepskin
cap,
was
running
lightly
and
rapidly
up
the
worn
steps
of
the
stone
staircase.
One
of
the
members
going

lean
official
with
a
portfolio-insurance
out
of
his
way
and
looked
disapprovingly.
at
the
legs
of
the
stranger,
then
glanced
inquiry
at
Obninsk's
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
standing
at
the
top
of
the
stairs.
His
good-naturedly
beaming
face
above
the
embroidered
collar
of
his
uniform
beamed
more
than
ever
when
he
recognized
the
man
coming
up.
"Why,
it's
actually
you,
Levin,
at
last!"
he
said
with
a
friendly
mocking
smile,
scanning
Levin
as
he
approached.
"How
is
it
you
have
deigned
to
look
me
up
in
this
denationalization
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
and
not
content
with
shaking
hands,
he
kissed
his
friend.
"Have
you
been
here
long?"
"I
have
just
come,
and
very
much
wanted
to
see
you,"
said
Levin,
looking
shyly
and
at
the
same
time
angrily
and
uneasily
around.
"Well,
let's
go
into
my
room,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
who
knew
his
friend's
sensitive
and
irritable
shyness,
and,
taking
his
arm,
he
drew
him
along,
as
though
guiding
him
through
dangers.
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
on
familiar
terms
with
almost
all
his
acquaintances,
and
called
almost
all
of
them
by
their
Christian
names:
old
men
of
sixty-eight
boys
of
twenty-first
actors,
ministers,
merchants,
and
adjuvant
so
that
many
of
his
intimate
chums
were
to
be
found
at
the
extreme
ends
of
the
social
ladder,
and
would
have
been
very
much
surprised
to
learn
that
they
had,
through
the
medium
of
Obninsk's
something
in
common.
He
was
the
familiar
friend
of
everyone
with
whom
he
took
a
glass
of
champagne,
and
he
took
a
glass
of
champagne
with
everyone,
and
when
in
consequence
he
met
any
of
his
disreputable
chums,
as
he
used
in
joke
to
call
many
of
his
friends,
in
the
presence
of
his
subordinates,
he
well
knew
how,
with
his
characteristic
tact,
to
diminish
the
disagreeable
impression
made
on
them.
Levin
was
not
a
disreputable
chum,
but
Obninsk's
with
his
ready
tact,
felt
that
Levin
fancied
he
might
not
care
to
show
his
intimacy
with
him
before
his
subordinates,
and
so
he
made
haste
to
take
him
off
into
his
room.
Levin
was
almost
of
the
same
age
as
Obninsk's
their
intimacy
did
not
rest
merely
on
champagne.
Levin
had
been
the
friend
and
companion
of
his
early
youth.
They
were
fond
of
one
another
in
spite
of
the
difference
of
their
characters
and
tastes,
as
friends
are
fond
of
one
another
who
have
been
together
in
early
youth.
But

this,

is
often
the
way
with
men
who
have
selected
careers
of
different
kinds.
in
discussion
he
would
even
justify
the
other's
career,
in
his
heart
despised
it.
It
seemed
to
each
of
them
that
the
life
he
led
himself
was
the
only
real
life,
and
the
life
led
by
his
friend
was
a
mere
phantasmagoria
Obninsk's
could
not
restrain
a
slight
mocking
smile
at
the
sight
of
Levin.
How
often
he
had
seen
him
come
up
to
Moscow
from
the
country
where
he
was
doing
something,
but
what
precisely
Stepan
Arkalyk
could
never
quite
make
out,
and
indeed
he
took
no
interest
in
the
matter.
Levin
arrived
in
Moscow
always
excited
and
in
a
hurry,
rather
ill
at
ease
and
irritated
by
his
own
want
of
ease,
and
for
the
most
part
with
a
perfectly
new,
unexpected
view
of
things.
Stepan
Arkalyk
laughed
at
this,
and
liked
it.
In
the
same
way
Levin
in
his
heart
despised
the
town
mode
of
life
of
his
friend,
and
his
official
duties,
which
he
laughed
at,
and
regarded
as
trifling.
But
the
difference
was
that
Obninsk's
as
he
was
doing
the
same
as
every
one
did,
laughed
complacently
and
good-humoured
while
Levin
laughed
without
complacency
and
sometimes
angrily.
"We
have
long
been
expecting
you,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
going
into
his
room
and
letting
Levin's
hand
go
as
though
to
show
that
here
all
danger
was
over.
"I
am
very,
very
glad
to
see
you,"
he
went
on.
"Well,
how
are
you?
Ehart
When
did
you
come?"
Levin
was
silent,
looking
at
the
unknown
faces
of
Obninsk's
two
companions,
and
especially
at
the
hand
of
the
elegant
Grinevsky
which
had
such
long
white
fingers,
such
long
yellow
filberts
nails,
and
such
huge
shining
studs
on
the
shirt-jacket
that
apparently
they
absorbed
all
his
attention,
and
allowed
him
no
freedom
of
thought.
Obninsk's
noticed
this
at
once,
and
smiled.
"Ah,
to
be
sure,
let
me
introduce
you,"
he
said.
"My

said
Grinevsky
holding
out
his
slender
hand
with
its
long
nails.
Levin
frowned,
shook
hands
coldly.
and
at
once
turned
to
Obninsk's
Though
he
had
a
great
respect
for
his
half-brother,
an
author
well
known
to
all
Russia,
he
could
not
endure
it
when
people
treated
him
not
as
Konstantin
Levin,
but
as
the
brother
of
the
celebrated
Kozo
"No,
I
am
no
longer
a
district
councilor.
I
have
quarreled
with
them
all,
and
don't
go
to

meetings
any
more,"
he
said,
turning
to
Obninsk's
"You've
been
quick
about
it!"
said
Obninsk's
with
a
smile.
"But
how?
why?"
"It's
a
long
story.
I
will
tell
you
some
time,"
said
Levin,
but
he
began
telling
him
at
once.
"Well,
to
put
it
shortly,
I
was
convinced
that
nothing
was
really
done
by
the
district
councils,
or
ever
could
be,"
he
began,
as
though
some
one
had
just
insulted
him.
"On

side
it's

on

side"
(he
stammered.
"it's

in
the
form

but
in

he
said,
as
hotly
as
though
someone
of
those
present
had
opposed
his
opinion.
"Ahab

said
Stepan
Arkalyk
"However,
we
can
go

that

"Yes,
later.
But
I
wanted
to
see
you,"
said
Levin,
looking
with
hatred
at
Grinevsky
hand.
Stepan
Arkalyk
gave
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile.
"How
was
it
you
used
to
say
you
would
never
wear
European
dress
again?"
he
said,
scanning
his
new
suit,
obviously
cut
by
a
French
tailor.
"Ah!
I
see:
a
new
phase."
Levin
suddenly
blushed.
not
as
grown
men
blush,
slightly,
without
being
themselves
aware
of
it,
but
as
boys
blush,
feeling
that
they
are
ridiculous
through
their
shyness,
and
consequently
ashamed
of
it
and
blushing
still
more,
almost
to
the
point
of
tears.
And
it
was
so
strange
to
see
this
sensible,
manly
face
in
such
a
childish
plight,
that
Obninsk's
left
off
looking
at
him.
"Oh,
where
shall
we
meet?
You
know
I
want
very
much
to
talk
to
you,"
said
Levin.
Obninsk's
seemed
to
ponder.
"I'll
tell
you
what?
let's
go
to
Gurinder
to
lunch,
and
there
we
can
talk.
I
am
free
till
three."
"No,"
answered
Levin,
after
an
instant,
thought,
"I
have
got
to
go
on
somewhere
else."
"All
right,
then,
let's
dine
together."
"Diner"
together?
But
I
have
nothing
very
particular,
only
a
few
words
to
say,
and
a
question
I
want
to
ask
you,
and
we
can
have
a
talk
afterwards."
"Well,
say
the
few
words,
then,
at
once,
and
we'll
gossip
after
dinner."
"Well,
it's
this,"
said
Levindale
"but
it's
of
no
importance,
though."
His
face
all
at
once
took
an
expression
of
anger
from
the
effort
he
was
making
to
surmount
his
shyness.
"What
are
the
Shtern
doing?
Everything
as
it
used
to
be?"
he
said.
Stepan
Arkalyk
who
had
long
known
that
Levin
was
in
love
with
his
sister-in-law,
Kitty,
gave
a
hardly
perceptible
smile,
and
his
eyes
sparkled
merriment
"You
said
a
few
words,
but
I
can't
answer
in
a
few
words,
because:
Excuse
me
a
minute;
A
secretary
came
in,
with
respectful
familiarity
and
the
modest
consciousness,
characteristic
of
every
secretary,
of
superiority
to
his
chief
in
the
knowledge
of
their
business;
he
went
up
to
Obninsk's
with
some
papers,
and
began,
under
pretense
of
asking
a
question,
to
explain
some
objection.
Stepan
Arkalyk
without
hearing
him
out,
laid
his
hand
genially
on
the
secretary's
sleeve.
"No,
you
do
as
I
told
you,"
he
said,
softening
his
words
with
a
smile,
and
with
a
brief
explanation
of
his
view
of
the
matter
he
turned
away
from
the
papers,
and
said:
"So
do
it
that
way,
if
you
please,
Zahar
Nikiya
The
secretary
retired
in
confusion.
During
the
consultation
with
the
secretary
Levin
had
completely
recovered
from
his
embarrassment.
He
was
standing
with
his
elbows
on
the
back
of
a
chair,
and
on
his
face
was
a
look
of
ironical
attention.
"I
don't
understand
it,
I
don't
understand
it,"
he
said.
"What
don't
you
understandable
said
Obninsk's
smiling
as
brightly
as
ever,
and
picking
up
a
cigarette.
He
expected
some
queer,
outburst
from
Levin.
"I
don't
understand
what
you
are
doing,"
said
Levin,
shrugging
his
shoulders.
"How
can
you
do
it
seriously?"
"Why
not?"
"Why,
because
there's
nothing
in
it."
"You
think
so,
but
we're
overwhelmed
with
work."
"On
paper.
But,
there,
you've
a
gift
for
it,"
added
Levin.
"That's
to
say,
you
think
there's
a
lack
of
something
in
me?"
"Perhaps
so,"
said
Levin.
"But
all
the
same
I
admire
your
grandeur,
and
am
proud
that
I've

friend
in
such
a

You've
not
answered
my
question,
though,"
he
went
on,
with
a
desperate
effort
looking
Obninsk's
straight
in
the
face.
"Oh,
that's
all
very
well.
You
wait
a
bit,
and
you'll
come
to

Yes,
as

question,
there
is
no

but
it's
a
pity
you've
been
away
so
long."
"Oh,
why
so?"
Levin
queried.
panic-struck
"Oh,
nothing,"
responded
Obninsk's
"We'll
talk
it
over.
But

you
up
to

"Oh,
we'll
talk
about
that,
too,
later
on,"
said
Levin,
reddening,
again
up
to
his
ears.
"All
right.
I

said
Stepan
Arkalyk
"I
should
ask
you
to

"Now

I
know

or

Stepan
Arkalyk
called
out
laughing.
"No,

And
Levin
went
out
of
the
room,
only
when
he
was
in
the
doorway
remembering
that
he
had
forgotten
to
take
leave
of
Obninsk's
colleagues.
"That
gentleman
must
be
a
man
of
great
energy,"
said
Grinevsky
when
Levin
had
gone
away.
"Yes,

dear

said
Stepan
Arkalyk
nodding
his
head,
"he's

"You

Arkalyk
"Ah,
yes,
I'm
in
a
poor
way,
a
bad
way,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
with
a
heavy
sigh.
Chapter
6
When
Obninsk's
asked
Levin
what
had
brought
him
to
town,
Levin
blushed.
and
was
furious
with
himself
for
blushing.
because
he
could
not
answer,
"I
have
come
to
make
your
sister-in-law
an
offer,"
though
that
was
precisely
what
he
had
come
for.
The
families
of
the
Levins
and
the
Shtern
were
old,
noble
Moscow
families,
and
had
always
been
on
intimate
and
friendly
terms.
This
intimacy
had
grown
still
closer
during
Levin's
student
days.
He
had
both
prepared
for
the
university
with
the
young
Prince
Shtern
the
brother
of
Kitty
and
Dolly,
and
had
entered
at
the
same
time
with
him.
In
those
days
Levin
used
often
to
be
in
the
Shtern
house,
and
he
was
in
love
with
the
Shtern
household.
Strange
as
it
may
appear,
it
was
with
the
household,
the
family,
that
Konstantin
Levin
was
in
love,
especially
with
the
feminine
half
of
the
household.
Levin
did
not
remember
his
own
mother,
and
his
only
sister
was
older
than
he
was,
so
that
it
was
in
the
Shtern
house
that
he
saw
for
the
first
time
that
inner
life
of
an
old,
noble,
cultivated,
and
honorable
family
of
which
he
had
been
deprived
by
the
death
of
his
father
and
mother.
All
the
members
of
that
family,
especially
the
feminine
half,
were
pictured
by
him,
as
it
were,
wrapped
about
with
a
mysterious
poetical
veil,
and
he
not
only
perceived
no
defects
whatever
in
them,
but
under
the
poetical
veil
that
shrouded
them
he
assumed
the
existence
of
the
loftiest
sentiments
and
every
possible
perfection.
Why
it
was
the
three
young
ladies
had
one
day
to
speak
French,
and
the
next
English;
why
it
was
that
at
certain
hours
they
played
by
turns
on
the
piano,
the
sounds
of
which
were
audible
in
their
brother's
room
above,
where
the
students
used
to
work;
why
they
were
visited
by
those
professors
of
French
literature,
of
music,
of
drawing,
of
dancy
why
at
certain
hours
all
the
three
young
ladies,
with
Mademoiselle
Linotype
drove
in
the
coach
to
the
Tvorba
boulevard,
dressed
in
their
satin
clobber
Dolly
in
a
long
one,
Natalia
in
a
half-mad,
one,
and
Kitty
in
one
so
short
that
her
shapely
legs
in
tightly-focused
red
stockings
were
visible
to
all
behooves
why
it
was
they
had
to
walk
about
the
Tvorba
boulevard
escorted
by
a
footmen,
with
a
gold
cockade
in
his
hat-check
this
and
much
more
that
was
done
in
their
mysterious
world
he
did
not
understand,
but
he
was
sure
that
everything
that
was
done
there
was
very
good,
and
he
was
in
love
precisely
with
the
mystery
of
the
proceedings.
In
his
student
days
he
had
all
but
been
in
love
with
the
eldest.
Dolly,
but
she
was
soon
married
to
Obninsk's
Then
he
began
being
in
love
with
the
second.
He
felt,
as
it
were,
that
he
had
to
be
in
love
with
one
of
the
sisters,
only
he
could
not
quite
make
out
which.
But
Natalia,
too,
had
hardly
made
her
appearance
in
the
world
when
she
married
the
diplomat
Lvov.
Kitty
was
still
a
child
when
Levin
left
the
university.
Young
Shtern
went
into
the
navy,
was
drowned
in
the
Baltic,
and
Levin's
relations
with
the
Shtern
in
spite
of
his
friendship
with
Obninsk's
became
less
intimate.
But
when
early
in
the
winter
of
this
year
Levin
came
to
Moscow,
after
a
year
in
the
country,
and
saw
the
Shtern
he
realized
which
of
the
three
sisters
he
was
indeed
destined
to
love.
One
would
have
thought
that
nothing
could
be
simpler
than
for
him,
a
man
of
good
family,
rather
rich
than
poor,
and
thirty-year
years
old,
to
make
the
young
Princess
Shtern
an
offer
of
marriage;
in
all
likelihood
he
would
at
once
have
been
looked
upon
as
a
good
match.
But
Levin
was
in
love,
and
so
it
seemed
to
him
that
Kitty
was
so
perfect
in
every
respect
that
she
was
a
creature
far
above
everything
earthmother
and
that
he
was
a
creature
so
low
and
so
earthly
that
it
could
not
even
be
conceived
that
other
people
and
she
herself
could
regard
him
as
worthy
of
her.
After
spending
two
months
in
Moscow
in
a
state
of
enchilada.
seeing
Kitty
almost
every
day
in
society,
into
which
he
went
so
as
to
meet
her,
he
abruptly
decided
that
it
could
not
be,
and
went
back
to
the
country.
Levin's
conviction
that
it
could
not
be
was
founded
on
the
idea
that
in
the
eyes
of
her
family
he
was
a
disadvantageous
and
worthless
match
for
the
charming
Kitty,
and
that
Kitty
herself
could
not
love
him.
In
her
family's
eyes
he
had
no
ordinary,
definite
career
and
position
in
society,
while
his
contemporaries
by
this
time,
when
he
was
thirty-year
were
already,
one
a
colonel,
and
another
a
professor,
another
director
of
a
bank
and
railways,
or
president
of
a
board
like
Obninsk's
But
he
(he
knew
very
well
how
he
must
appear
to
others)
was
a
country
gentleman,
occupied
in
breeding
cattle,
shooting
game,
and
building
barnstormed
in
other
words,
a
fellow
of
no
ability,
who
had
not
turned
out
well,
and
who
was
doing
just
what,
according
to
the
ideas
of
the
world,
is
done
by
people
fit
for
nothing
else.
The
mysterious,
enchanting
Kitty
herself
could
not
love
such
an
ugly
person
as
he
conceived
himself
to
be,
and,
above
all,
such
an
ordinary,
in
no
way
striking
person.
Moreover,
his
attitude
to
Kitty
in
the
past-due
attitude
of
a
grown-up
person
to
a
child,
arising
from
his
friendship
with
her
brother-in-law
to
him
yet
another
obstacle
to
love.
An
ugly,
good-natured
man,
as
he
considered
himself,
might,
he
supposed,
be
liked
as
a
friend;
but
to
be
loved
with
such
a
love
as
that
with
which
he
loved
Kitty,
one
would
need
to
be
a
handsome
and,
still
more,
a
distinguished
man.
He
had
heard
that
women
often
did
care
for
ugly
and
ordinary
men,
but
he
did
not
believe
it,
for
he
judged
by
himself,
and
he
could
not
himself
have
loved
any
but
beautiful,
mysterious,
and
exceptional
women.
But
after
spending
two
months
alone
in
the
country,
he
was
convinced
that
this
was
not
one
of
those
passions
of
which
he
had
had
experience
in
his
early
youth?
that
this
feeling
gave
him
not
an
instant,
rest;
that
he
could
not
live
without
deciding
the
question,
would
she
or
would
she
not
be
his
wife,
and
that
his
despair
had
arisen
only
from
his
own
imaginingthat
that
he
had
no
sort
of
proof
that
he
would
be
rejected.
And
he
had
now
come
to
Moscow
with
a
firm
determination
to
make
an
offer,
and
get
married
if
he
were
accepted.
Or
...
he
could
not
conceive
what
would
become
of
him
if

were

Chapter
7
On
arriving
in
Moscow
by
a
morning
train,
Levin
had
put
up
at
the
house
of
his
elder
half-brother,
Kozo
After
changing
his
clothes
he
went
down
to
his
brother's
study,
intending
to
talk
to
him
at
once
about
the
object
of
his
visit,
and
to
ask
his
advice;
but
his
brother
was
not
alone.
With
him
there
was
a
well-known
professor
of
philosophy,
who
had
come
from
Harkreader
expressly
to
clear
up
a
difference
that
had
arisen
between
them
on
a
very
important
philosophical
question.
The
professor
was
carrying
on
a
hot
crusade
against
materiality
Sergey
Kozo
had
been
following
this
crusade
with
interest,
and
after
reading
the
professor's
last
article,
he
had
written
him
a
letter
stating
his
objections.
He
accused
the
professor
of
making
too
great
concessions
to
the
materiality
And
the
professor
had
promptly
appeared
to
argue
the
matter
out.
The
point
in
discussion
was
the
question
then
in
vogue:
Is
there
a
line
to
be
drawn
between
psychological
and
physiological
phenomena
in
man?
and
if
so,
where?
Sergey
Ivanovo.
met
his
brother
with
the
smile
of
chilly
friendliness
he
always
had
for
everyone,
and
introducing
him
to
the
professor,
went
on
with
the
conversation.
A
little
man
in
spectacles,
with
a
narrow
forehead,
tore
himself
from
the
discussion
for
an
instant
to
greet
Levin,
and
then
went
on
talking
without
paying
any
further
attention
to
him.
Levin
sat
down
to
wait
till
the
professor
should
go,
but
he
soon
began
to
get
interested
in
the
subject
under
discussion.
Levin
had
come
across
the
magazine
articles
about
which
they
were
disqualifed
and
had
read
them,
interested
in
them
as
a
development
of
the
first
principles
of
science,
familiar
to
him
as
a
natural
science
student
at
the
university.
But
he
had
never
connected
these
scientific
deductions
as
to
the
origin
of
man
as
an
animal,
as
to
reflex
action,
biology,
and
sociology,
with
those
questions
as
to
the
meaning
of
life
and
death
to
himself,
which
had
of
late
been
more
and
more
often
in
his
mind.
As
he
listened
to
his
brother's
argument
with
the
professor,
he
noticed
that
they
connected
these
scientific
questions
with
those
spiritual
problems,
that
at
times
they
almost
touched
on
the
latter?
but
every
time
they
were
close
upon
what
seemed
to
him
the
chief
point,
they
promptly
beat
a
hasty
retreat,
and
plunged
again
into
a
sea
of
subtle
distinctions,
reservations,
quotations,
allusions,
and
appeals
to
authorities,
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
understood
what
they
were
talking
about.
"I
cannot
admit
it,"
said
Sergey
Ivanovo.
with
his
habitual
clears
precision
of
expression,
and
elegance
of
phrase.
"I
cannot
in
any
case
agree
with
Keiss-Kuna's
that
my
whole
conception
of
the
external
world
has
been
derived
from
perceptions.
The
most
fundamental
idea,
the
idea
of
existence,
has
not
been
received
by
me
through
sensation;
indeed,
there
is
no
special
sense.
for
the
transmission
of
such
an
idea."
"Yes,
but
they.
and
Knazko
and
Priscilla
answer
that
your
consciousness
of
existence
is
derived
from
the
conjunction
of
all
your
sensations,
that
that
consciousness
of
existence
is
the
result
of
your
sensations.
Wurth
indeed,
says
plainly
that,
assuming
there
are
no
sensations,
it
follows
that
there
is
no
idea
of
existence."
"I
maintain
the
contrary.
began
Sergey
Ivanovo.
But
here
it
seemed
to
Levin
that
just
as
they
were
close
upon
the
real
point
of
the
matter,
they
were
again
retreating,
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
put
a
question
to
the
professor.
"According
to
that,
if
my
senses
are
annihilated,
if
my
body
is
dead,
I
can
have
no
existence
of
any
sorte'
he
queried.
The
professor,
in
annoyance,
and,
as
it
were,
mental
suffering
at
the
interruption,
looked
round
at
the
strange
inquirer,
more
like
a
bargepole,'
than
a
philosopher,
and
turned
his
eyes
upon
Sergey
Ivanovo.
as
though
to
ask:
What's
one
to
say
to
him?
But
Sergey
Ivanovo.
who
had
been
talking
with
far
less
heat
and
one-sidedness
than
the
professor,
and
who
had
sufficient
breadth
of
mind
to
answer
the
professor,
and
at
the
same
time
to
comprehend
the
simple
and
natural
point
of
view
from
which
the
question
was
put,
smiled
and
said:
"That
question
we
have
no
right
to
answer
as
yet."
"We
have
not
the
requisite
data,"
chimed
in
the
professor,
and
he
went
back
to
his
argument.
"No,"
he
said;
"I
would
point
out
the
fact
that
if,
as
Priscilla
directly
asserts,
perception
is
based
on
sensation,
then
we
are
bound
to
distinguish
sharply
between
these
two
concepts
Levin
listened
no
more,
and
simply
waited
for
the
professor
to
go.

When
the
professor
had
gone,
Sergey
Ivanovo.
turned
to
his
brother.
"Delights
that
you've
come.
For
some
time,
is
it?
How's
your
farming
getting
on?"
Levin
knew
that
his
elder
brother
took
little
interest
in
farming,
and
only
put
the
question
in
deference
to
him,
and
so
he
only
told
him
about
the
sale
of
his
wheat
and
money
matters.
Levin
had
meant
to
tell
his
brother
of
his
determination
to
get
married,
and
to
ask
his
advice;
he
had
indeed
firmly
resolved
to
do
so.
But
after
seeing
his
brother,
listening
to
his
conversation
with
the
professor,
hearing
afterwards
the
unconsciously
patronizing
tone
in
which
his
brother
questioned
him
about
agricultural
matters
(their
mother's
property
had
not
been
divided,
and
Levin
took
charge
of
both
their
shares),
Levin
felt
that
he
could
not
for
some
reason
begin
to
talk
to
him
of
his
intention
of
marrying.
He
felt
that
his
brother
would
not
look
at
it
as
he
would
have
wished
him
to.
"Well,
how
is
your

Sergey
Ivanovo.

"Perhaps

Levin

"Oh!

This

half-brother
of

Levin
read
it,
and
without
raising
his

stood
with

Sergey
Ivanovo.
There
was
a
struggle
in
his

the
desire
to
forget
his
unhappy
brother
for
the
time,
and
the
consciousness
that
it
would
be
base
to
do
so.
"He
obviously
wants
to
offend
me,"
pursued
Sergey
Ivanovo.
"but
he
cannot
offend
me,
and
I
should
have
wished
with
all
my
heart
to
assist

but
I
know
it's
impossible

"Yes,
yes,"
repeated
Levin.
"I

shall

"If

Sergey

Levin
was
on
the
point
of
setting
off
at
once
to
see
him,
but
on
second
thought
he
decided
to
put
off
his
visit
till
the
evening.
The
first
thing
to
do
to
set
his
heart
at
rest
was
to
accomplish
what
he
had
come
to
Moscow
for.
From
his
brother's
Levin
went
to
Obninsk's
office,
and
on
getting
news
of
the
Shtern
from
him,
he
drove
to
the
place
where
he
had
been
told
he
might
find
Kitty.
Chapter
9
At
four
o'clock,
conscious
of
his
throbbing
heart,
Levin
stepped
out
of
a
hired
sledge
at
the
Zoological
Gardens,
and
turned
along
the
path
to
the
frozen
mounds
and
the
skating
ground,
knowing
that
he
would
certainly
find
her
there,
as
he
had
seen
the
Shtern
carriage
at
the
entrance.
It
was
a
bright,
frosty
day.
Rows
of
carriages,
sledging,
drivers,
and
policemen
were
standing
in
the
approach.
Crowds
of
well-dressed
people,
with
hats
bright
in
the
sun,
swarmed
about
the
entrance
and
along
the
well-tailored
little
paths
between
the
little
houses
adorned
with
carving
in
the
Russian
style.
The
old
curly
bird
of
the
gardens,
all
their
twigs
laden
with
snow,
looked
as
though
freshly
decked
in
sacred
vestments.
He
walked
along
the
path
towards
the
skating.
and
kept
saying
to
himself.
mustn't
be
excited,
you
must
be
calm.
What's
the
matter
with
you?
What
do
you
want?
Be
quiet,
stupid,"
he
conjured
his
heart.
And
the
more
he
tried
to
compose
himself,
the
more
breathless
he
found
himself.
An
acquaintance
met
him
and
called
him
by
his
name,
but
Levin
did
not
even
recognize
him.
He
went
towards
the
mounds,
whence
came
the
clank
of
the
chains
of
sledges
as
they
slipped
down
or
were
dragged
up,
the
rumble
of
the
sliding
sledging,
and
the
sounds
of
merry
voices.
He
walked
on
a
few
steps,
and
the
skating.
lay
open
before
his
eyes,
and
at
once,
amidst
all
the
skaters,
he
knew
her.
He
knew
she
was
there
by
the
rapture
and
the
terror
that
seized
on
his
heart.
She
was
standing
talking
to
a
lady
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
ground.
There
was
apparently
nothing
striking
either
in
her
dress
or
her
attitude.
But
for
Levin
she
was
as
easy
to
find
in
that
crowd
as
a
rose
among
nettlesome
Everything
was
made
bright
by
her.
She
was
the
smile
that
shed
light
on
all
round
her.
"Is
it
possible
I
can
go
over
there
on
the
ice,
go
up
to
her?"
he
thought.
The
place
where
she
stood
seemed
to
him
a
holy
shrine,
unappropriate
and
there
was
one
moment
when
he
was
almost
retreating,
so
overwhelmed
was
he
with
terror.
He
had
to
make
an
effort
to
master
himself,
and
to
remind
himself
that
people
of
all
sorts
were
moving
about
her,
and
that
he
too
might
come
there
to
skate.
He
walked
down,
for
a
long
while
avoiding
looking
at
her
as
at
the
sun,
but
seeing
her,
as
one
does
the
sun,
without
looking.
On
that
day
of
the
week
and
at
that
time
of
day
people
of
one
set,
all
acquainted
with
one
another,
used
to
meet
on
the
ice.
There
were
crack
skaters
there,
showing
off
their
skill,
and
learners
clinging
to
chairs
with
timid,
awkward
movements,
boys,
and
elderly
people
skating
with
hygienic
motives.
They
seemed
to
Levin
an
elect
band
of
blissful
beings
because
they
were
here,
near
her.
All
the
skaters,
it
seemed,
with
perfect
self-praise
skated
towards
her,
skated
by
her,
even
spoke
to
her,
and
were
happy,
quite
apart
from
her,
enjoying
the
capital
ice
and
the
fine
weather.
Nikolay
Shtern
Kitty,
cousin,
in
a
short
jacket
and
tight
trousers,
was
sitting
on
a
garden
seat
with
his
skates
on.
Seeing
Levin,
he
shouted
to
him:
"Ah,
the
first
skater
in
Russia!"
Been
here
long?
First-round
ice-axes,
put
your
skates
on."
"I
haven't
got
my
skates.
Levin
answered,
marveling
at
this
boldness
and
ease
in
her
presence,
and
not
for
one
second
losing
sight
of
her,
though
he
did
not
look
at
her.
He
felt
as
though
the
sun
were
coming
near
him.
She
was
in
a
corner,
and
turning
out
her
slender
feet
in
their
high
boots
with
obvious
timidity,
she
skated
towards
him.
A
boy
in
Russian
dress,
desperately
waving
his
arms
and
bowed
down
to
the
ground,
overtook
her.
She
skated
a
little
uncertainties
taking
her
hands
out
of
the
little
muffin
that
hung
on
a
cord,
she
held
them
ready
for
emergency,
and
looking
towards
Levin,
whom
she
had
recognized,
she
smiled
at
him,
and
at
her
own
fears.
When
she
had
got
round
the
turn,
she
gave
herself
a
push
off
with
one
foot,
and
skated
straight
up
to
Shtern
Clutching
at
his
arm,
she
nodded
smiling
to
Levin.
She
was
more
splendid
than
he
had
imagined
her.
When
he
thought
of
her,
he
could
call
up
a
vivid
picture
of
her
to
himself,
especially
the
charm
of
that
little
fair
head,
so
freely
set
on
the
shapely
girlish
shoulders,
and
so
full
of
childish
brightness
and
good
humor.
The
childless
of
her
expression,
together
with
the
delicate
beauty
of
her
figure,
made
up
her
special
charm,
and
that
he
fully
realized.
But
what
always
struck
him
in
her
as
something
unloosen
for,
was
the
expression
of
her
eyes,
soft,
serene,
and
truthful,
and
above
all,
her
smile,
which
always
transported
Levin
to
an
enchanted
world,
where
he
felt
himself
softened
and
tender,
as
he
remembered
himself
in
some
days
of
his
early
childhood.
"Have
you
been
here
long?"
she
said,
giving
him
her
hand.
"Thank
you,"
she
added,
as
he
picked
up
the
handkerchief
that
had
fallen
out
of
her
muffin
"IBM
I've
not
long
...
yesterday
...
I
mean
today
...
I
arrived,"
answered
Levin,
in
his
emotion
not
at
once
understanding
her
question.
"I
was
meaning
to
come
and
see
you,"
he
said;
and
then,
recollection
with
what
intention
he
was
trying
to
see
her,
he
was
promptly
overcome
with
confusion
and
blushed.
"I
didn't
know
you
could
skate.
and
skate
so
well."
She
looked
at
him
earnestly,
as
though
wishing
to
make
out
the
cause
of
his
confusion.
"Your
praise
is
worth
having.
The
tradition
is
kept
up
here
that
you
are
the
best
of
skates
she
said,
with
her
little
black-governed
hand
brushing
a
grain
of
hoarse
off
her
muffin
"Yes,
I
used
once
to
skate
with
passion;
I
wanted
to
reach
perfection.'
"You
do
everything
with
passion,
I
think,"
she
said
smiling.
"I
should
so
like
to
see
how
you
skate.
Put
on
skates,
and
let
us
skate
together."
"Skeeter"
together"
Can
that
be
possible?'
thought
Levin,
gazing
at
her.
"I'll
put
them
on
directly,"
he
said.
And
he
went
off
to
get
skates.
"It's
a
long
while
since
we've
seen
you
here,
sir,"
said
the
attendant,
supporting
his
foot,
and
screwing
on
the
heel
of
the
skate.
"Except
you,
there's
none
of
the
gentlemen
first-rate

Will
that
be
all
right?"
said
he,
tightening
the
strap.
"Oh,
yes,
yes;
make
haste,
please,"
answered
Levin,
with
difficulty
restraining
the
smile
of
rapture
which
would
overstaffed
his
face.
"Yes,"
he
thought,
"this
now
is
life,
this
is
happiness)
_Total
she
said;
_may

Speak
to
her
now?
But
that's
just
why
I'm
afraid
to

I'm
happy
now,
happy
in
hope,
anyway:
And

But

Away
with

Levin
rose
to
his
feet,
took
off
his
overcoat,
and
scurrying
over
the
rough
ice
round
the
hut,
came
out
on
the
smooth
ice
and
skated
without
effort,
as
it
were,
by
simple
exercise
of
will,
increasing
and
slackening
speed
and
turning
his
course.
He
approached
with
timidity,
but
again
her
smile
reassured
him.
She
gave
him
her
hand,
and
they
set
off
side
by
side,
going
faster
and
faster,
and
the
more
rapidly
they
moved
the
more
tightly
she
grasped
his
hand.
"With
you
I
should
soon
learn?
I
somehow
feel
confidence
in
you,"
she
said
to
him.
"And
I
have
confidence
in
myself
when
you
are
leaning
on
me,"
he
said,
but
was
at
once
panic-stricken
at
what
he
had
said,
and
blushed.
And
indeed,
no
sooner
had
he
uttered
these
words,
when
all
at
once,
like
the
sun
going
behind
a
cloud,
her
face
lost
all
its
friendliness,
and
Levin
detected
the
familiar
change
in
her
expression
that
denoted
the
working
of
thought;
a
crease
showed
on
her
smooth
brow.
"Is
there
anything
troubling
you`re
I've
no
right
to
ask
such
a
question,"
he
added
hurries
"Oh,

No,
I
have
nothing
to
trouble
me,"
she
responded
coldness
and
she
added
immediately:
"You
haven't
seen
Mlodych
Linotype
have
you?"
"Not
yet."
"Go
and
speak
to
her,
she
likes
you
so
much."
"What's
wrong?
I
have
offended
her.
Lord
help
me!"
thought
Levin,
and
he
flew
towards
the
old
Frenchwoman
with
the
gray
ringmaster
who
was
sitting
on
a
bench.
Smiling
and
showing
her
false
teeth,
she
greeted
him
as
an
old
friend.
"Yes,
you
see
we're
growing
up,"
she
said
to
him,
glancing
towards
Kitty,
"and
growing
old.
_To
bearable
has
grown
big
now!"
pursued
the
Frenchwoman,
laughing,
and
she
reminded
him
of
his
joke
about
the
three
young
ladies
whom
he
had
compared
to
the
three
bears
in
the
English
nursery
tale.
"Do
you
remember
that's
what
you
used
to
call
them?"
He
remembered
absolutely
nothing,
but
she
had
been
laughing
at
the
joke
for
ten
years
now,
and
was
fond
of
it.
"Now,
go
and
skate.
go
and
skate.
Our
Kitty
has
learned
to
skate
nicely,
hasn't
she?"
When
Levin
darted
up
to
Kitty
her
face
was
no
longer
stern;
her
eyes
looked
at
him
with
the
same
sincerity
and
friendliness,
but
Levin
fancied
that
in
her
friendliness
there
was
a
certain
note
of
deliberate
composure.
And
he
felt
depressed.
After
talking
a
little
of
her
old
governess
and
her
peculiarities.
she
questioned
him
about
his
life.
"Surely
you
must
be
dull
in
the
country
in
the
winter,
aren't
you?"
she
said.
"No,
I'm
not
dull,
I
am
very
busy,"
he
said,
feeling
that
she
was
holding
him
in
check
by
her
composed
tone,
which
he
would
not
have
the
force
to
break
through,
just
as
it
had
been
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter.
"Are
you
going
to
stay
in
town
long?"
Kitty
questioned
him.
"I
don't
know,"
he
answered,
not
thinking
of
what
he
was
saying.
The
thought
that
if
he
were
held
in
check
by
her
tone
of
quiet
friendliness
he
would
end
by
going
back
again
without
deciding
anything
came
into
his
mind,
and
he
resolved
to
make
a
struggle
against
it.
"How
is
it
you
don't
know?"
"I
don't
know.
It
depends
upon
you,"
he
said,
and
was
immediately
horror.
at
his
own
words.
Whether
it
was
that
she
had
heard
his
words,
or
that
she
did
not
want
to
hear
them,
she
made
a
sort
of
stumble,
twice
struck
out,
and
hurriedly
skated
away
from
him.
She
skated
up
to
Mlodych
Linotype
said
something
to
her,
and
went
towards
the
pavilion
where
the
ladies
took
off
their
skates.
"My
God!
what
have
I
done!"
Merciful
God!
help
me,
guide
me,"
said
Levin,
praying
inwardly,
and
at
the
same
time,
feeling
a
need
of
violent
exercise,
he
skated
about
describing
inner
and
outer
circles.
At
that
moment
one
of
the
young
men,
the
best
of
the
skaters
of
the
day,
came
out
of
the
coffee-house
in
his
skates,
with
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth.
Taking
a
run,
he
dashed
down
the
steps
in
his
skates,
crashing
and
bounding
up
and
down.
He
flew
down,
and
without
even
changing
the
position
of
his
hands,
skated
away
over
the
ice.
"Ah,
that's
a
new
trick"
said
Levin,
and
he
promptly
ran
up
to
the
top
to
do
this
new
trick.
"Don't
break
your
neck),
it
needs
practice"
Nikolay
Shtern
shouted
after
him.
Levin
went
to
the
steps,
took
a
run
from
above
as
best
he
could,
and
dashed
down,
preserving
his
balance
in
this
unwonted
movement
with
his
hands.
On
the
last
step
he
stumbled,
but
barely
touching
the
ice
with
his
hand,
with
a
violent
effort
recovered
himself,
and
skated
off,
laughing.
"How
splendid,
how
nice
he
isue.
Kitty
was
thinking
at
that
time,
as
she
came
out
of
the
pavilion
with
Mlodych
Linotype
and
looked
towards
him
with
a
smile
of
quiet
affection,
as
though
he
were
a
favorite
brother.
"And
can
it
be
my
fault,
can
I
have
done
anything
wrong?
They
talk
of
flirtations
I
know
it's
not
he
that
I
love;
but
still
I
am
happy
with
him,
and
he's
so
jolly.
Only,
why
did
he
say
thatAmerica
she
mused.
Catching
sight
of
Kitty
going
away,
and
her
mother
meeting
her
at
the
steps,
Levin,
flushed
from
his
rapid
exercise,
stood
still
and
pondered
a
minute.
He
took
off
his
skates,
and
overtook
the
mother
and
daughter
at
the
entrance
of
the
gardens.
"Delights
to
see
you,"
said
Princess
Shtern
"On
Thursdays
we
are
home,
as
always."
"Today,
then?"
"We
shall
be
pleased
to
see
you,"
the
princess
said
stiffness
This
stiffness
hurt
Kitty,
and
she
could
not
resist
the
desire
to
smooth
over
her
mother's
coldrooms,
She
turned
her
head,
and
with
a
smile
said:
"Good-morning
till
this
evening."
At
that
moment
Stepan
Arkalyk
his
hat
cocked
on
one
side,
with
beaming
face
and
eyes,
strode
into
the
garden
like
a
conquering
hero.
But
as
he
approached
his
mother-in-law,
he
responded
in
a
mournful
and
crestfallen,
tone
to
her
inquiries
about

After
a
little
subdued
and
dejected
conversation
with
his
mother-in-law,
he
threw
out
his
chest
again,
and
put
his
arm
in
Levin,
"Well,
shall
we
set
off?"'
he
asked.
"I've
been
thinking
about
you
all
this
time,
and
I'm
very,
very
glad
you've
come,"
he
said,
looking
him
in
the
face
with
a
significant
air.
"Yes,
come
along,"
answered
Levin
in
ecstasy,
hearing
unceasingly
the
sound
of
that
voice
saying,
"Good-morning
till
this
evening,"
and
seeing
the
smile
with
which
it
was
said.
"To
the
England
or
the
Hermits
"I
don't
mind
which;
"All
right,
then,
the
England,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
selecting
that
restaurant
because
he
owed
more
there
than
at
the
Hermitage,
and
consequently
considered
it
mean
to
avoid
it.
"Have
you

That's
first-rate,
for
I

my

The
friends
hardly
spoke
all
the
way.
Levin
was
wondering
what
that
change
in
Kitty,
expression
had
meant,
and
alternately
assuring
himself
that
there
was
hope,
and
falling
into
despair,
seeing
clearly
that
his
hopes
were
insane,
and
yet
all
the
while
he
felt
himself
quite
another
man,
utterly
unlike
what
he
had
been
before
her
smile
and
those
words,
"Good-morning
till
this
evening."
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
absorbed
during
the
drive
in
composing
the
menu
of
the
dinner.
"You
like
turbot,
don't
you?"
he
said
to
Levin
as
they
were
arriving.
"Eight

Levin.

Chapter

When
Levin
went
into
the
restaurant
with
Obninsk's
he
could
not
help
noticing
a
certain
peculiarity
of
expression,
as
it
were,
a
restrained
radiance,
about
the
face
and
whole
figure
of
Stepan
Arkalyk
Obninsk's
took
off
his
overcoat,
and
with
his
hat
over
one
ear
walked
into
the
dining
room,
giving
directions
to
the
Tatar
waiters,
who
were
clustered
about
him
in
evening
coats,
bearing
napkins.
Bowing
to
right
and
left
to
the
people
he
met,
and
here
as
everywhere
joyously
greeting
acquaintances,
he
went
up
to
the
sideboard
for
a
preliminary
appetizer
of
fish
and
vodka,
and
said
to
the
painted
Frenchwoman
decked
in
ribbons,
lace,
and
ringmaster
behind
the
counter,
something
so
amusing
that
even
that
Frenchwoman
was
moved
to
genuine
laughter.
Levin
for
his
part
refrained
from
taking
any
vodka
simply
because
he
felt
such
a
loathing
of
that
Frenchwoman,
all

it
seemed,

He
made
haste
to
move
away
from
her,
as
from
a
dirty
place.
His
whole
soul
was
filled
with
memories
of
Kitty,
and
there
was
a
smile
of
triumph
and
happiness
shining
in
his
eyes.

a

cloth
over
the

it
already

he
pushed
up

came
to
a

before
Stepan
Arkalyk
with

a
bill

in

his
commands.

added,

a
look
of
dissatisfaction
on

face,
"that
I
shan't

am

"I

in
five

darted
in
with

of

said
Stepan

gazing
at

with
a
subtle
smile.
"Well,

what
have

said
Levin
in
a
quivering
voice,
feeling
that
all
the
muscles
of
his
face
were
quivering
too.
"How
do
you
look
at

Stepan
Arkalyk
slowly
emptied
his
glass
of
Chablis,
never
taking
his
eyes
off
Levin.
"IBM

Stepan
Arkalyk
"there's

with

"I

Stepan

at
his
excitement.
"It
seems
so
to
me
sometimes.
That
will
be
awful
for
me,
and
for
her
too."
"Oh,
well,
anyway
there's
nothing
awful
in
it
for
a
girl.
Every
girl's
proud
of
an
offer."
"Yes,
every
girl,
but
not
she."
Stepan
Arkalyk
smiled.
He
so
well
knew
that
feeling
of
Levin,
that
for
him
all
the
girls
in
the
world
were
divided
into
two
classes:

class-A
the
girls

her,
and
those
girls
with
all

of

and
very

the
other
class-A
alone,
having
no
weaknesses
of
any

and
higher
than

"Staying

he
said,
holding
back
Levin's
hand
as
it
pushed
away
the
sauce.
Levin
obediently
helped
himself
to
sauce,
but
would
not
let
Stepan
Arkalyk
go
on
with
his
dinner.
"No,
stop
a
minute,
stop
a

he
said.
"You
must
understand
that
it's

"But

more:

At

face
suddenly
lighted
up
with
a
smile,
a
smile
not
far
from
tears
of
emotion.
"She

Levin.

he
said,
getting
up
from
his
seat.
"All

But
Levin
could
not
sit
down.
He
walked
with
his
firm
tread
twice
up
and
down
the
little
cage
of
a
room,
blinked
his
eyelids
that
his
tears
might
not
fall,
and
only
then
sat
down
to
the
table.
"You
must
understand,"
said
he,
"it's
not

I've
been
in

but
it's
not
that.

of

Most
likely
you've
not
made
a
study
of
spiders
and
don't
know

and
so
it
is
with
me."
"It's
very
well
for
you
to
talk
like
that;
it's
very
much
like
that
gentleman
in
Dickens
who
used
to

But

me
that,
what's
to
be
done?
Your

older,
while
you're
full
of
life.
Before
you've
time
to
look
round,
you
feel
that
you
can't
love
your
wife
with
love,
however
much
you
may
esteem
her.
And
then
all
at
once
love
turns
up,
and
you're
done
for,
done
for,"
Stepan
Arkalyk
said
with
weary
despair.
Levin
half
smiled.
"Yes,
you're
done
for,"
resumed
Obninsk's
"But
what's
to
be
done?"
"Don't
steal
rolls."
Stepan
Arkalyk
laughed
outright.
"Oh,
moralist,
But
you
must
understand,
there
are
two
women;
one
insists
only
on
her
rights,
and
those
rights
are
your
love,
which
you
can't
give
her;
and
the
other
sacrifices
everything
for
you
and
asks
for
nothing.
What
are
you
to
do?
How
are
you
to
act?
There's
a
fearful
tragedy
in
it."
"If
you
care
for
my
profession
of
faith
as
regards
that,
I'll
tell
you
that
I
don't
believe
there
was
any
tragedy
about
it.
And
this
is
why.
To
my
mind,
love
...
both
the
sorts
of
love,
which
you
remember
Plato
defines
in
his
Banquet,
served
as
the
test
of
men.
Some
men
only
understand
one
sort,
and
some
only
the
other.
And
those
who
only
know
the
non-playing
love
have
no
need
to
talk
of
tragedy.
In
such
love
there
can
be
no
sort
of
tragedy.
'I'm
much
obliged
for
the
gratification,"
my
humble
respects,
all
the
tragedy.
And
in
platonic,
love
there
can
be
no
tragedy,
because
in
that
love
all
is
clear
and
pure,
because:

his

And
he
added

"But
perhaps
you
are

Very
likely
...
I
don't
know,
I

"It's
this,
don't
you
see,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
"you're
very
much
all
of
a
piece.
That's
your
strong
point
and
your
failing.
You
have
a
character
that's
all
of
a

and
you
want
the
whole
of
life
to
be
of
a
piece
too-big

not
how
it
is.

the

to

all
the

the

that's
not
how
it
is.
You

to

and

it
is.
All
the
variety,
all
the
charm,
all
the
beauty
of
life
is
made
up
of
light
and
shadow."
Levin
sighed
and
made
no
reply.
He
was
thinking
of
his
own
affairs,
and
did
not
hear
Obninsk's
And
suddenly
both
of
them
felt
that
though
they
were
friends,
though
they
had
been
dining
and
drinking
together,
which
should
have
drawn
them
closer,
yet
each
was
thinking
only
of
his
own
affairs,
and
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
one
another.
Obninsk's
had
more
than
once
experienced
this
extreme
sense
of
aloofness,
instead
of
intimacy,"
coming
on
after
dinner,
and
he
knew
what
to
do
in
such
cases.
"Bill"
he
called,
and
he
went
into
the
next
room
where
he
promptly
came
across
an
aide-de-camp
of
his
acquaintance
and
dropped
into
conversation
with
him
about
an
actress
and
her
protector.
And
at
once
in
the
conversation
with
the
aide-de-camp
Obninsk's
had
a
sense
of
relaxation
and
relief
after
the
conversation
with
Levin,
which
always
put
him
to
too
great
a
mental
and
spiritual
strain.
When
the
Tatar
appeared
with
a
bill
for
twenty-six
roubles
and
odd
kopecks,
besides
a
tip
for
himself,
Levin,
who
would
another
time
have
been
horrified,
like
any
one
from
the
country,
at
his
share
of
fourteen
roubles,
did
not
notice
it,
paid,
and
set
off
homework
to
dress
and
go
to
the
Shtern
there
to
decide
his
fate.
Chapter
12
The
young
Princess
Kitty
Shtern
was
eighteenfold
It
was
the
first
winter
that
she
had
been
out
in
the
world.
Her
success
in
society
had
been
greater
than
that
of
either
of
her
elder
sisters,
and
greater
even
than
her
mother
had
anticipated.
To
say
nothing
of
the
young
men
who
danced
at
the
Moscow
balls
being
almost
all
in
love
with
Kitty,
two
serious
suitors
had
already
this
first
winter
made
their
appearances
Levin,
and
immediately
after
his
departure,
Count
Vrye
Levin's
appearance
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter,
his
frequent
visits,
and
evident
love
for
Kitty,
had
led
to
the
first
serious
conversations
between
Kitty,
parents
as
to
her
future,
and
to
disputes
between
them.
The
prince
was
on
Levin's
side;
he
said
he
wished
for
nothing
better
for
Kitty.
The
princess
for
her
part,
going
round
the
question
in
the
manner
peculiar
to
women,
maintained
that
Kitty
was
too
young,
that
Levin
had
done
nothing
to
prove
that
he
had
serious
intentions,
that
Kitty
felt
no
great
attraction
to
him,
and
other
side
issues;
but
she
did
not
state
the
principal
point,
which
was
that
she
looked
for
a
better
match
for
her
daughter,
and
that
Levin
was
not
to
her
liking,
and
she
did
not
understand
him.
When
Levin
had
abruptly
departed,
the
princess
was
delighted,
and
said
to
her
husband
triumphed
"You
see
I
was
right."
When
Vrye
appeared
on
the
scene,
she
was
still
more
delighted,
confirmed
in
her
opinion
that
Kitty
was
to
make
not
simply
a
good,
but
a
brilliant
match.
In
the
mother's
eyes
there
could
be
no
comparison
between
Vrye
and
Levin.
She
disliked
in
Levin
his
strange
and
uncompromising
opinions
and
his
shyness,
in
society,
founded,
as
she
supposed,
on
his
pride
and
his
queer,
sort
of
life,
as
she
considered
it,
absorbed
in
cattle
and
peasants.
She
did
not
very
much
like
it
that
he,
who
was
in
love
with
her
daughter,
had
kept
coming
to
the
house
for
six
weeks,
as
though
he
were
waiting
for
something,
inspecting.
as
though
he
were
afraid
he
might
be
doing
them
too
great
an
honor
by
making
an
offer,
and
did
not
realize
that
a
man,
who
continually
visits
at
a
house
where
there
is
a
young
unmarried
girl,
is
bound
to
make
his
intentions
clear.
And
suddenly,
without
doing
so,
he
disappeared.
"It's
as
well
he's
not
attractive
enough
for
Kitty
to
have
fallen
in
love
with
him,"
thought
the
mother.
Vrye
satisfied
all
the
mother's
desires.
Very
wealthy,
clever,
of
aristocratic
family,
on
the
highs
to
a
brilliant
career
in
the
army
and
at
court,
and
a
fascinating
man.
Nothing
better
could
be
wished
for.
Vrye
openly
flirted
with
Kitty
at
balls,
danced
with
her,
and
came
continually
to
the
house,
consequently
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
seriousness
of
his
intentions.
But,
in
spite
of
that,
the
mother
had
spent
the
whole
of
that
winter
in
a
state
of
terrible
anxiety
and
agitation.
Princess
Shtern
had
herself
been
married
thirty
years
ago,
her
aunt
arranging
the
match.
Her
husband,
about
whom
everything
was
well
known
before
hand,
had
come,
looked
at
his
future
bride,
and
been
looked
at.
The
match-making
aunt
had
ascertained
and
communicated
their
mutual
impression.
That
impression
had
been
favorable.
Afterwards,
on
a
day
fixed
beforehand,
the
expected
offer
was
made
to
her
parents,
and
accepted.
All
had
passed
very
simply
and
easily.
So
it
seemed,
at
least,
to
the
princess.
But
over
her
own
daughters
she
had
felt
how
far
from
simple
and
easy
is
the
business,
apparently
so
commonplace,
of
marrying
off
one's
daughters.
The
panics
that
had
been
lived
through,
the
thoughts
that
had
been
brooded
over,
the
money
that
had
been
wasted,
and
the
disputes
with
her
husband
over
marrying
the
two
elder
girls,
Darya
and
Natalia,
Now,
since
the
youngest
had
come
out,
she
was
going
through
the
same
terrors,
the
same
doubts,
and
still
more
violent
quarrels
with
her
husband
than
she
had
over
the
elder
girls.
The
old
prince,
like
all
fathers
indeed,
was
exceedingly
punctilious
on
the
score
of
the
honor
and
reputation
of
his
daughters.
He
was
irrationally
jealous
over
his
daughters,
especially
over
Kitty,
who
was
his
favorite.
At
every
turn
he
had
scenes
with
the
princess
for
compromising
her
daughter.
The
princess
had
grown
accustomed
to
this
already
with
her
other
daughters,
but
now
she
felt
that
there
was
more
ground
for
the
prince's
touchiness.
She
saw
that
of
late
years
much
was
changed
in
the
manners
of
society,
that
a
mother's
duties
had
become
still
more
difficult.
She
saw
that
girls
of
Kitty,
age
formed
some
sort
of
clubs,
went
to
some
sort
of
lectures,
mixed
freely
in
men's
society;
drove
about
the
streets
alone,
many
of
them
did
not
curtsied
and,
what
was
the
most
important
thing,
all
the
girls
were
firmly
convinced
that
to
choose
their
husbands
was
their
own
affair,
and
not
their
parents)
"Marriages
aren't
made
nowadays
as
they
used
to
be,"
was
thought
and
said
by
all
these
young
girls,
and
even
by
their
elders.
But
how
marriages
were
made
now,
the
princess
could
not
learn
from
any
one.
The
French
fashion-conscious
the
parents
arranging
their
children's
future-oriented
not
accepted;
it
was
condemned.
The
English
fashion
of
the
complete
independence
of
girls
was
also
not
accepted,
and
not
possible
in
Russian
society.
The
Russian
fashion
of
match-making
by
the
offices
of
intermediate
persons
was
for
some
reason
considered
unseen
it
was
ridiculed
by
every
one,
and
by
the
princess
herself.
But
how
girls
were
to
be
married,
and
how
parents
were
to
marry
them,
no
one
knew.
Everyone
with
whom
the
princess
had
chanced
to
discuss
the
matter
said
the
same
thing:
"Merger
on
us,
it's
high
time
in
our
day
to
cast
off
all
that
old-fashioned
business.
It's
the
young
people
have
to
marry;
and
not
their
parents;
and
so
we
ought
to
leave
the
young
people
to
arrange
it
as
they
choose."
It
was
very
easy
for
anyone
to
say
that
who
had
no
daughters,
but
the
princess
realized
that
in
the
process
of
getting
to
know
each
other,
her
daughter
might
fall
in
love,
and
fall
in
love
with
someone
who
did
not
care
to
marry
her
or
who
was
quite
unfit
to
be
her
husband.
And,
however
much
it
was
instilled
into
the
princess
that
in
our
times
young
people
ought
to
arrange
their
lives
for
themselves,
she
was
unable
to
believe
it,
just
as
she
would
have
been
unable
to
believe
that,
at
any
time
whatever,
the
most
suitable
playthings
for
children
five
years
old
ought
to
be
loaded
pistols.
And
so
the
princess
was
more
uneasy
over
Kitty
than
she
had
been
over
her
elder
sisters.
Now
she
was
afraid
that
Vrye
might
confine
himself
to
simply
flirting
with
her
daughter.
She
saw
that
her
daughter
was
in
love
with
him,
but
tried
to
comfort
herself
with
the
thought
that
he
was
an
honorable
man,
and
would
not
do
this.
But
at
the
same
time
she
knew
how
easy
it
is,
with
the
freedom
of
manners
of
today,
to
turn
a
girl's
head,
and
how
lightly
men
generally
regard
such
a
crime.
The
week
before,
Kitty
had
told
her
mother
of
a
conversation
she
had
with
Vrye
during
a
mbH,
This
conversation
had
partly
reassured
the
princesses
but
perfectly
at
ease
she
could
not
be.
Vrye
had
told
Kitty
that
both
he
and
his
brother
were
so
used
to
obeying
their
mother
that
they
never
made
up
their
minds
to
any
important
undertaking
without
consulting
her.
"And
just
now,
I
am
impatiently
awaiting
my
mother's
arrival
from
Petersburg,
as
peculiarly
fortunate,"
he
told
her.
Kitty
had
repeated
this
without
attaching
any
significance
to
the
words.
But
her
mother
saw
them
in
a
different
light.
She
knew
that
the
old
lady
was
expected
from
day
to
day,
that
she
would
be
pleased
at
her
son's
choice,
and
she
felt
it
strange
that
he
should
not
make
his
offer
through
fear
of
vexing
his
mother.
However,
she
was
so
anxious
for
the
marriage
itself,
and
still
more
for
relief
from
her
fears,
that
she
believed
it
was
so.
Bitter
as
it
was
for
the
princess
to
see
the
unhappiness
of
her
eldest
daughter,
Dolly,
on
the
point
of
leaving
her
husband,
her
anxiety
over
the
decision
of
her
youngest
daughter's
fate
engrossed
all
her
feelings.
Today,
with
Levin's
reappearances
a
fresh
source
of
anxiety
arose.
She
was
afraid
that
her
daughter,
who
had
at
one
time,
as
she
fancier
a
feeling
for
Levin,
might,
from
extreme
sense
of
honor,
refuse
Vrye
and
that
Levin's
arrival
might
generally
complicate
and
delay
the
affair
so
near
being
concluded.
"Why,
has
he
been
here
long?"
the
princess
asked
about
Levin,
as
they
returned
home.
"He
came
today,
mammal
"There's
one
thing
I
want
to
say:
began
the
princess,
and
from
her
serious
and
alert
face,
Kitty
guessed
what
it
would
be.
"Mammals"
she
said,
flushing
hotly
and
turning
quickly
to
her,
"pleased
please
don't
say
anything
about
that.
I
know,
I
know
all
about
it."
She
wished
for
what
her
mother
wished
for,
but
the
motives
of
her
mother's
wishes
wounded
her.
"I
only
want
to
say
that
to
raise
hopes:
"Mammals"
darling,
for
goodness,
sake,
don't
talk
about
it.
It's
so
horrible
to
talk
about
it."
"I
won't,"
said
her
mother,
seeing
the
tears
in
her
daughter's
eyes;
"but
one
thing,
my
love;
you
promised
me
you
would
have
no
secrets
from
me.
You
won'tbe
"Never,
mammal
none,"
answered
Kitty,
flushing
a
little,
and
looking
her
mother
straight
in
the
face,
"but
there's
no
use
in
my
telling
you
anything,
and
I
...
I
...
if
I
wanted
to,
I
don't
know
what
to
say
or
how
...
I
don't
know:
"No,
she
could
not
tell
an
untruth
with
those
eyes,"
thought
the
mother,
smiling
at
her
agitation
and
happiness.
The
princess
smiled
that
what
was
taking
place
just
now
in
her
soul
seemed
to
the
poor
child
so
immense
and
so
important.
Chapter
13
After
dinner,
and
till
the
beginning
of
the
evening,
Kitty
was
feeling
a
sensation
akin
to
the
sensation
of
a
young
man
before
a
battle.
Her
heart
throbbed
violently,
and
her
thoughts
would
not
rest
on
anything.
She
felt
that
this
evening,
when
they
would
both
meet
for
the
first
time,
would
be
a
turning
point
in
her
life.
And
she
was
continually
picturing
them
to
herself,
at
one
moment
each
separately,
and
then
both
together.
When
she
mused
on
the
past,
she
dwelt
with
pleasure,
with
tenderness.
on
the
memories
of
her
relations
with
Levin.
The
memories
of
childhood
and
of
Levin's
friendship
with
her
dead
brother
gave
a
special
poetic
charm
to
her
relations
with
him.
His
love
for
her,
of
which
she
felt
certain,
was
flattering
and
delightful
to
her;
and
it
was
pleasant
for
her
to
think
of
Levin.
In
her
memories
of
Vrye
there
always
entered
a
certain

at

as
though
there
were

in
Vrye
he
was
very
simple
and
nice,
but
in
herself,
while
with
Levin
she
felt
perfectly
simple
and
clear.
But,
on
the
other
hand,
directly
she
thought
of
the
future
with
Vrye
there
arose
before
her
a
perspective
of
brilliant
happoiness
with
Levin
the
future
seemed
misty.
When
she
went
upstairs
to
dress,
and
looked
into
the
looking-glasses
she
noticed
with
joy
that
it
was
one
of
her
good
days,
and
that
she
was
in
complete
possession
of
all
her
forces.
needed
this
so
for
what
lay
before
her:
she
was
conscious
of
external
composure
and
free
grace
in
her
movements.
At
half-pay
seven
she
had
only
just
gone
down
into
the
drawing
room,
when
the
footmen,
announced,
"Kool
Dmitrin
Levin/Stern
The
princess
was
still
in
her
room,
and
the
prince
had
not
come
in.
"So
it
is
to
be,"
thought
Kitty,
and
all
the
blood
seemed
to
rush
to
her
heart.
She
was
horrified
at
her
paleoanthropologists
as
she
glanced
into
the
looking-glasses
At
that
moment
she
knew
beyond
doubt
that
he
had
come
early
on
purpose
to
find
her
alone
and
to
make
her
an
offer.
And
only
then
for
the
first
time
the
whole
thing
presented
itself
in
a
new,
different
aspects
only
then
she
realized
that
the
question
did
not
affect
her
only-begotten

she
would
be
happy,
and
whom
she
loved.
that
she
would
have
that
moment
to
wound
a
man
whom
she
liked.
And
to
wound
him
cruelties
What
for?
Because
he,
dear
fellow,
loved
her,
was
in
love
with
her.
But
there
was
no
help
for
it,
so
it
must
be,
so
it
would
have
to
be.
"My
God!
shall
I
myself
really
have
to
say
it
to
him?"
she
thought.
"Can
I
tell
him
I
don't
love
him?
That
will
be
a
lie.
What
am
I
to
say
to
him?
That
I
love
someone
else?
No,
that's
impossible.
I'm
going
away,
I'm
going
away."
She
had
reached
the
door,
when
she
heard
his
step.
"No!
it's
not
honest.
What
have
I
to
be
afraid
of?
I
have
done
nothing
wrong.
What
is
to
be,
will
be!"
I'll
tell
the
truth.
And
with
him
one
can't
be
ill
at
ease.
Here
he
is,"
she
said
to
herself,
seeing
his
powerful,
shy
figure,
with
his
shining
eyes
fixed
on
her.
She
looked
straight
into
his
face,
as
though
imploring
him
to
spare
her,
and
gave
her
hand.
"It's
not
time
yet;
I
think
I'm
too
early,"
he
said
glancing
round
the
empty
drawing
room.
When
he
saw
that
his
expectations
were
realized,
that
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
him
from
speaking,
his
face
became
gloomy.
"Oh,
no,"
said
Kitty,
and
sat
down
at
the
table.
"But
this
was
just
what
I
wanted,
to
find
you
alone,"
he
began,
not
sitting
down,
and
not
looking
at
her,
so
as
not
to
lose
courage.
"Mammals"
will
be
down
directly.
She
was
very
much
tired;
Yesterday:
She
talked
on,
not
knowing
what
her
lips
were
utterly
and
not
taking
her
supplied
and
caressing
eyes
off
him.
He
glanced
at
her;
she
blushed.
and
ceased
speaking.
"I
told
you
I
did
not
know
whether
I
should
be
here
long
...
that
it
depended
on
you:
She
dropped
her
head
lower
and
lower,
not
knowing
herself
what
answer
she
should
make
to
what
was
coming.
"That
it
depended
on
you,"
he
repeated.
"I
meant
to
say
...
I
meant
to
say
...
I
came
for
this
...
to
be

wife's
he
brought
out,
not
knowing
what
he
was
saying?
but
feeling
that
the
most
terrible
thing
was
said,
he
stopped
short
and
looked
at
her:
She
was
breathing
heavily,
not
looking
at
him.
She
was
feeling
ecstasy.
Her
soul
was
flooded
with
happiness.
She
had
never
anticipated
that
the
utterance
of
love
would
produce
such
a
powerful
effect
on
her.
But
it
lasted
only
an
instant.
She
remembered
Vrye
She
lifted
her
clear,
truthful
eyes,
and
seeing
his
desperate
face,
she
answered
hasty
"That
cannot
be
...
forgive
me."
A
moment
ago,
and
how
close
she
had
been
to
him,
of
what
importance
in
his
life"
And
how
aloof
and
remote
from
him
she
had
become
now!
"It
was
bound
to
be
so,"
he
said,
not
looking
at
her.
He
bowed,
and
was
meaning
to
retreat.
Chapter
14
But
at
that
very
moment
the
princess
came
in.
There
was
a
look
of
horror
on
her
face
when
she
saw
them
alone,
and
their
disturbed
faces.
Levin
bowed
to
her,
and
said
nothing.
Kitty
did
not
speak
nor
lift
her
eyes.
"Thank
God,
she
has
refused
him,"
thought
the
mother,
and
her
face
lighted
up
with
the
habitual
smile
with
which
she
greeted
her
guests
on
Thursdays.
She
sat
down
and
began
questioning
Levin
about
his
life
in
the
country.
He
sat
down
again,
waiting
for
other
visitors
to
arrive,
in
order
to
retreat
unnoticed.
Five
minutes
later
there
came
in
a
friend
of
Kitty,
married
the
preceding
winter,
Countess
Nordstorm
She
was
a
thin,
sally
sickly,
and
nervous
woman,
with
brilliant
black
eyes.
She
was
fond
of
Kitty,
and
her
affection
for
her
showed
itself,
as
the
affection
of
married
women
for
girls
always
does,
in
the
desire
to
make
a
match
for
Kitty
after
her
own
ideal
of
married
happoiness
she
wanted
her
to
marry
Vrye
Levin
she
had
often
met
at
the
Shtern
early
in
the
winter,
and
she
had
always
disliked
him.
Her
invariable
and
favorite
pursuit,
when
they
met,
consisted
in
making
fun
of
him.
"I
do
like
it
when
he
looks
down
at
me
from
the
height
of
his
grandeur,
or
breaks
off
his
learned
conversation
with
me
because
I'm
a
fool,
or
is
condescending
to
me.
I
like
that
so;
to
see
him
condescending.
I
am
so
glad
he
can't
bear
me,"
she
used
to
say
of
him.
She
was
right,
for
Levin
actually
could
not
bear
her,
and
despised
her
for
what
she
was
proud
of
and
regarded
as
a
fine
characteristically
nervousness,
her
delicate
contempt
and
indifference
for
everything
coarse
and
earthmother
The
Countess
Nordstorm
and
Levin
got
into
that
relation
with
one
another
not
seldom
seen
in
society,
when
two
persons,
who
remain
externally
on
friendly
terms,
despise
each
other
to
such
a
degree
that
they
cannot
even
take
each
other
seriously,
and
cannot
even
be
offended
by
each
other.
The
Countess
Nordstorm
pounced
upon
Levin
at
once.
"Ah,
Konstantin
Dmitrin
So
you've
come
back
to
our
corrupt
Babylon.
she
said,
giving
him
her
tiny,
yellow
hand,
and
recalling
what
he
had
chanced
to
say
early
in
the
winter,
that
Moscow
was
a
Babylon.
"Come,
is
Babylon
reformed,
or
have
you
degenerates
she
added,
glancing
with
a
simpered
at
Kitty.
"It's
very
flattering
for
me,
countess,
that
you
remember
my
words
so
well,"
responded
Levin,
who
had
succeeded
in
recovering
his
composure,
and
at
once
from
habit
dropped
into
his
tone
of
joking
hostility
to
the
Countess
Nordstorm
"They
must
certainly
make
a
great
impression
on
you."
"Oh,
I
should
think
so"
I
always
note
them
all
down.
Well,
Kitty,
have
you
been
skating
against
And
she
began
talking
to
Kitty.
Ax
as
it
was
for
Levin
to
withdraw
now,
it
would
still
have
been
easier
for
him
to
perpetrate
this
awkwardness
than
to
remain
all
the
evening
and
see
Kitty,
who
glanced
at
him
now
and
then
and
avoided
his
eyes.
He
was
on
the
point
of
getting
up,
when
the
princess,
noticing
that
he
was
silent,
addressed
him.
"Shall
you
be
long
in
Moscowitz
You're
busy
with
the
district
council,
though,
aren't
you,
and
can't
be
away
for
long?"
"No,
princess,
I'm
no
longer
a
member
of
the
council,"
he
said.
"I
have
come
up
for
a
few
days."
"There's
something
the
matter
with
him,"
thought
Countess
Nordstorm
glancing
at
his
stern,
serious
face.
"He
isn't
in
his
old
argumentative
mood.
But
I'll
draw
him
out.
I
do
love
making
a
fool
of
him
before
Kitty,
and
I'll
do
it."
"Kool
Dmitrin
she
said
to
him,
"do
explain
to
me,
please,
what's
the
meaning
of
it.
You
know
all
about
such
things.
At
home
in
our
village
of
Kalugin
all
the
peasants
and
all
the
women
have
drunk
up
all
they
possessed,
and
now
they
can't
pay
us
any
rent.
What's
the
meaning
of
that?
You
always
praise
the
peasants
so."
At
that
instant
another
lady
came
into
the
room,
and
Levin
got
up.
"Excuse
me,
countess,
but
I
really
know
nothing
about
it,
and
can't
tell
you
anything,"
he
said,
and
looked
round
at
the
officer
who
came
in
behind
the
lady.
"That
must
be
Vrye
thought
Levin,
and,
to
be
sure
of
it,
glanced
at
Kitty.
She
had
already
had
time
to
look
at
Vrye
and
looked
round
at
Levin.
And
simply
from
the
look
in
her
eyes,
that
grew
unconsciously
brighter,
Levin
knew
that
she
loved
that
man,
knew
it
as
surely
as
if
she
had
told
him
so
in
words.
But
what
sort
of
a
man
was
he?
Now,
whether
for
good
or
for
ill,
Levin
could
not
choose
but
remain;
he
must
find
out
what
the
man
was
like
whom
she
loved.
There
are
people
who,
on
meeting
a
successful
rival,
no
matter
in
what,
are
at
once
disposed
to
turn
their
backs
on
everything
good
in
him,
and
to
see
only
what
is
bad.
There
are
people,
on
the
other
hand,
who
desire
above
all
to
find
in
that
lucky
rival
the
qualities
by
which
he
has
outstripped
them,
and
seek
with
a
throbbing
ache
at
heart
only
what
is
good.
Levin
belonged
to
the
second
class.
But
he
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
what
was
good
and
attractive
in
Vrye
It
was
apparent
at
the
first
glance.
Vrye
was
a
squarely
built,
dark
man,
not
very
tall,
with
a
good-humoured
handsome,
and
exceedingly
calm
and
resolute
face.
Everything
about
his
face
and
figure,
from
his
short-cropped
black
hair
and
freshly
shaven
chin
down
to
his
loosely
fitting,
brand-new
uniform,
was
simple
and
at
the
same
time
elegant.
Making
way
for
the
lady
who
had
come
in,
Vrye
went
up
to
the
princess
and
then
to
Kitty.
As
he
approached
her,
his
beautiful
eyes
shone
with
a
specially
tender
light,
and
with
a
faint,
happy,
and
modestly
triumphant
smile
(so
it
seemed
to
Levin,
bowing
carefully
and
respectfully
over
her,
he
held
out
his
small
broad
hand
to
her.
Greeting
and
saying
a
few
words
to
everyone,
he
sat
down
without
once
glancing
at
Levin,
who
had
never
taken
his
eyes
off
him.
"Let
me
introduce
you,"
said
the
princess,
indicating
Levin.
"Kool
Dmitrin
Levin,
Count
Alexey
Kirilov.
Vrye
Vrye
got
up
and,
looking
cordially
at
Levin,
shook
hands
with
him.
"I
believe
I
was
to
have
dined
with
you
this
winter,"
he
said,
smiling
his
simple
and
open
smile?
"but
you
had
unexpectedly
left
for
the
country."
"Kool
Dmitrin
despises
and
hates
town
and
us
townspeople,"
said
Countess
Nordstorm
"My
words
must
make
a
deep
impression
on
you,
since
you
remember
them
so
well,"
said
Levin,
and,
suddenly
conscious
that
he
had
said
just
the
same
thing
before,
he
reddening,
Vrye
looked
at
Levin
and
Countess
Nordstorm
and
smiled.
"Are
you
always
in
the
country?"
he
inquired:
"I
should
think
it
must
be
dull
in
the
winter."
"It's
not
dull
if
one
has
work
to
do;
besides,
one's
not
dull
by
oneself.
Levin
replied
abruptly.
"I
am
fond
of
the
country,"
said
Vrye
noticing,
and
affecting
not
to
notice,
Levin's
tone.
"But
I
hope,
count,
you
would
not
consent
to
live
in
the
country
always,"
said
Countess
Nordstorm
"I
don't
know;
I
have
never
tried
for
long.
I
experienced
a
queer,
feeling
once,"
he
went
on.
"I
never
longed
so
for
the
country,
Russian
country,
with
bastard
shoes
and
peasants,
as
when
I
was
spending
a
winter
with
my
mother
in
Nice.
Nice
itself
is
dull
enough,
you
know.
And
indeed,
Naples
and
Sorrento
are
only
pleasant
for
a
short
time.
And
it's
just
there
that
Russia
comes
back
to
me
most
vividly.
and
especially
the
country.
It's
as
though:
He
talked
on,
addressing
both
Kitty
and
Levin,
turning
his
serene,
friendly
eyes
from
one
to
the
other,
and
saying
obviously
just
what
came
into
his
head.
Noticing
that
Countess
Nordstorm
wanted
to
say
something,
he
stopped
short
without
finishing
what
he
had
begun,
and
listened
attentively
to
her.
The
conversation
did
not
flag
for
an
instant,
so
that
the
princess,
who
always
kept
in
reserve,
in
case
a
subject
should
be
lacking,
two
heavy
guns-for-drugs
relative
advantages
of
classical
and
of
modern
education,
and
universal
military
service-area
not
to
move
out
either
of
them,
while
Countess
Nordstorm
had
not
a
chance
of
chaffing
Levin.
Levin
wanted
to,
and
could
not,
take
part
in
the
general
conversation;
saying
to
himself
every
instant,
"Now
go,"
he
still
did
not
go,
as
though
waiting
for
something.
The
conversation
fell
upon
table.
and
spirits,
and
Countess
Nordstorm
who
believed
in
spiritualism,
began
to
describe
the
marvels
she
had
seen.
"Ah,
countess,
you
really
must
take
me,
for
pity,
sake
do
take
me
to
see
them!
I
have
never
seen
anything
extraordinary,
though
I
am
always
on
the
lookout
for
it
everywhere,"
said
Vrye
smiling.
"Very
well,
next
Saturday,"
answered
Countess
Nordstorm
"But
you,
Konstantin
Dmitrin
do
you
believe
in
it?"
she
asked
Levin.
"Why
do
you
ask
me?
You
know
what
I
shall
say."
"But
I
want
to
hear
your
opinion."
"My
opinion,"
answered
Levin,
"is
only
that
this
table.
simply
proves
that
educated
society-sponsored
called-for
no
higher
than
the
peasants.
They

and
in

and
omens,
while

"Oh,
then
you
don't
believe
in

"I
can't

"But

myself?"
"The

us

"Then
you
think
I
tell
a
lie?"
And
she
laughed
a
mis-assessment
laugh.
"Oh,
no,
Masha.
Konstantin
Dmitrin
said
he
could
not
believe
in
it,"
said
Kitty,
blushing
for
Levin,
and
Levin
saw
this,
and,
still
more
exasperated,"
would
have
answered,
but
Vrye
with
his
bright
frank
smile
rushed
to
the
support
of
the
conversation,
which
was
threatening
to
become
disagreeable.
"You
do
not
admit
the
conceivable
at
all?"
he
queried.
"But
why
not?
We
admit
the
existence
of
electricity,
of
which
we
know
nothing.
Why
should
there
not
be
some
new
force,
still
unknown
to
us,
which;
"When
electricity
was
discovered,"
Levin
interrupted
hurries
"it
was
only
the
phenomenon
that
was
discovered,
and
it
was
unknown
from
what
it
proceeded
and
what
were
its
effects,
and
ages
passed
before
its
applications
were
conceived.
But
the
spirituality
have
begun
with
tables
writing
for
them,
and
spirits
appearing
to
them,
and
have
only
later
started
saying
that
it
is
an
unknown
force."
Vrye
listened
attentively
to
Levin,
as
he
always
did
listen,
obviously
interested
in
his
words.
"Yes,
but
the

say
we
don't
know
at
present
what
this
force
is,
but
there
is
a
force,
and
these
are
the
conditions
in
which
it
acts.
Let
the
scientific
men
find
out
what
the
force
consists
in.
No,
I
don't
see
why
there
should
not
be

it:
"Why,
because

electricity,"
Levin
interrupted
again,
"every
time
you
rub
tar
against
wool,
a
recognized
phenomenon
is
manifesting
but
in
this
case
it
does
not
happen
every
time,
and
so
it
follows
it
is
not
a
natural
phenomenon."
Feeling
probably
that
the
conversation
was
taking
a
tone
too
serious
for
a
drawing
room,
Vrye
made
no
rejoinder.
but
by
way
of
trying
to
change
the
conversation,
he
smiled
brightly-colored
and
turned
to
the
ladies.
"Do
let
us
try
at
once,
countess.
he
said;
but
Levin
would
finish
saying
what
he
thought.
"I
think,"
he
went
on,
"that
this
attempt
of
the
spirituality
to
explain
their
marvels
as
some
sort
of
new
natural
force
is
most
futile.
They
boldly
talk
of
spiritual
force,
and
then
try
to
subject
it
to
material
experiment."
Every
one
was
waiting
for
him
to
finish,
and
he
felt
it.
"And
I
think
you
would
be
a
first-rate
medium,"
said
Countess
Nordstorm
"there's
something
enthusiastic
in
you."
Levin
opened
his
mouth,
was
about
to
say
something,
reddening,
and
said
nothing.
"Do
let
us
try
table.
at
once,
please,"
said
Vrye
"Principles
will
you
allow
it?"
And
Vrye
stood
up,
looking
for
a
little
table.
Kitty
got
up
to
fetch
a
table,
and
as
she
passed,
her
eyes
met
Levin,
She
felt
for
him
with
her
whole
heart,
the
more
because
she
was
pitying
him
for
suffering
of
which
she
was
herself
the
cause.
"If
you
can
forgive
me,
forgive
me,"
said
her
eyes,
"I
am
so
happy."
"I
hate
them
all,
and
you,
and
myself,"
his
eyes
responded,
and
he
took
up
his
hat.
But
he
was
not
destined
to
escape.
Just
as
they
were
arranging
themselves
round
the
table,
and
Levin
was
on
the
point
of
retiring,
the
old
prince
came
in,
and
after
greeting
the
ladies,
addressed
Levin.
"Ah,
he
began
joyride
"Been
here
long,
my
boy?"'
I
didn't
even
know
you
were
in
town.
Very
glad
to
see
you."
The
old
prince
embraced
Levin,
and
talking
to
him
did
not
observe
Vrye
who
had
risen,
and
was
serenely
waiting
till
the
prince
should
turn
to
him.
Kitty
felt
how
distasteful
her
father's
warmth
was
to
Levin
after
what
had
happened.
She
saw,
too,
how
coldly
her
father
responded
at
last
to
Vrye
bow,
and
how
Vrye
looked
with
amiable
perplexity
at
her
father,
as
though
trying
and
failing
to
understand
how
and
why
anyone
could
be
hostilely
disposed
towards
him,
and
she
flushed.
"Princess
let
us
have

Countess
Nordstorm
"we

"What

Table.
Well,
you
must
excuse
me,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
but
to
my
mind
it
is
better
fun
to
play
the
ring
game,"
said
the
old
prince,
looking
at
Vrye
and
guessing
that
it
had
been
his
suggestion.
"There's
some
sense
in
that,
anyway."
Vrye
looked
wonderland
at
the
prince
with
his
resolute
eyes,
and,
with
a
faint
smile,
began
immediately
talking
to
Countess
Nordstorm
of
the
great
ball
that
was
to
come
off
next
week.
"I
hope
you
will
be
there?"
he
said
to
Kitty.
As
soon
as
the
old
prince
turned
away
from
him,
Levin
went
out
unnoticed,
and
the
last
impression
he
carried
away
with
him
of
that
evening
was
the
smiling,
happy
face
of
Kitty
answering
Vrye
inquiry
about
the
ball.
Chapter
15
At
the
end
of
the
evening
Kitty
told
her
mother
of
her
conversation
with
Levin,
and
in
spite
of
all
the
pity
she
felt
for
Levin,
she
was
glad
at
the
thought
that
she
had
received
an
_on
She
had
no
doubt
that
she
had
acted
rightly.
But
after
she
had
gone
to
bed,
for
a
long
while
she
could
not
sleep.
One
impression
pursued
her
relentlessly.
It
was
Levin's
face,
with
his
scowling
brows,
and
his
kind
eyes
looking
out
in
dark
dejection
below
them,
as
he
stood
listening
to
her
father,
and
glancing
at
her
and
at
Vrye
And
she
felt
so
sorry
for
him
that
tears
came
into
her
eyes.
But
immediately
she
thought
of
the
man
for
whom
she
had
given
him
up.
She
vividly
recalled
his
manly,
resolute
face,
his
noble
self-praise
and
the
good
nature
conspicuous
in
everything
towards
everyone.
She
remembered
the
love
for
her
of
the
man
she
loved,
and
once
more
all
was
gladness
in
her
soul,
and
she
lay
on
the
pillow,
smiling
with
happiness.
"I'm
sorry,
I'm
sorry;
but
what
could
I
do?
It's
not
my
fault,"
she
said
to
hertz.
but
an
inner
voice
told
her
something
else.
Whether
she
felt
remorse
at
having
won
Levin's
love,
or
at
having
refused
him,
she
did
not
know.
But
her
happiness
was
poisoned
by
doubts.
"Lord,
have
pity
on
us;
Lord,
have
pity
on
us;
Lord,
have
pity
on
us!"
she
repeated
to
herself,
till
she
fell
asleep.
Meanwhile
there
took
place
below,
in
the
prince's
little
library,
one
of
the
scenes
so
often
repeated
between
the
parents
on
account
of
their
favorite
daughter.
"Whatever
I'll
tell
you
what"
shouted
the
prince,
waving
his
arms,
and
at
once
wrapping
his
squirrel.

round
him
again.
"That
you've
no
pride,
no
dignity?
that
you're
disgree
ruining
your
daughter
by
this
vulgar,
stupid
match-up
"But,
really,
for
mercy,
sake,
prince,
what
have
I
done?"
said
the
princess,
almost
crying.
She,
pleased
and
happy
after
her
conversation
with
her
daughter,
had
gone
to
the
prince
to
say
good-night
as
usual,
and
though
she
had
no
intention
of
telling
him
of
Levin's
offer
and
Kitty,
refusal,
still
she
hinted
to
her
husband
that
she
fancied
things
were
practically
settled
with
Vrye
and
that
he
would
declare
himself
so
soon
as
his
mother
arrived.
And
thermal
at
those
words,
the
prince
had
all
at
once
flown
into
a
passion,
and
began
to
use
unseemly
language.
"What
have
you
done?
I'll
tell
you
what.
First
of
all,
you're
trying
to
catch
an
eligible
gentleman,
and
all
Moscow
will
be
talking
of
it,
and
with
good
reason.
If
you
have
evening
parties,
invite
everyone,
don't
pick
out
the
possible
suitors.
Invite
all
the
young
bucks.
Engaged
a
piano
player,
and
let
them
dance,
and
not
as
you
do
things
nowadays,
hunting
up
good
matches.
It
makes
me
sick,
sick
to
see
it,
and
you've
gone
on
till
you've
turned
the
poor
wenches"
head.
Levin's
a
thousand
times
the
better
man.
As
for
this
little
Petersburg
swell,
they're
turned
out
by
machinery,
all
on
one
pattern,
and
all
precious
rubbish.
But
if
he
were
a
prince
of
the
blood,
my
daughter
need
not
run
after
anyone."
"But
what
have
I
done?"
"Why,
you).
The
prince
was
crying
wre
"I
know
if
one
were
to
listen
to
you,"
interrupted
the
princess,
"we
should
never
marry
our
daughter.
If
it's
to
be
so,
we'd
better
go
into
the
country."
"Well,
and
we
had
better."
"But
do
wait
a
minute.
Do
I
try
and
catch
them?
I
don't
try
to
catch
them
in
the
least.
A
young
man,
and
a
very
nice
one,
has
fallen
in
love
with
her,
and
she,
I
fancy;
"Oh,
yes,
you
fancy,
And
how
if
she
really
is
in
love,
and
he's
no
more
thinking
of
marriage
than
I
am"
Oh,
that
I
should
live
to
see
it!
Ah,
spiritualism,
Ah,
Nice,
Ah,
the
ball!"
And
the
prince,
imagining
that
he
was
mimicking
his
wife,
made
a
mincing
curtsied
at
each
word.
"And
this
is
how
we're
preparing
wretchedness
for
Kittyhawk
and
she's
really
got
the
notion
into
her
head:
"But
what
makes
you
suppose
so?"
"I
don't
supposed
I
know.
We
have
eyes
for
such
things,
though
women-in-medicine
haven't.
I
see
a
man
who
has
serious
intentions,
that's
Levindale
and
I
see
a
peacock,
like
this
feather-light
who's
only
amusing
himself."
"Oh,
well,
when
once
you
get
an
idea
into
your
head"
"Well,
you'll
remember
my
words,
but
too
late,
just
as

Dollywood
"Well,
well,
we
won't
talk
of
it,"
the
princess
stopped
him,
recollection
her
unlucky
Dolly.
"By
all
means,
and
good
night!"
And
signing
each
other
with
the
cross,
the
husband
and
wife
parted
with
a
kiss,
feeling
that
they
each
remained
of
their
own
opinion.
The
princess
had
at
first
been
quite
certain
that
that
evening
had
settled
Kitty,

and
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
Vrye
intentions,
but
her
husband's
words
had
disturbed
her.
And
returning
to
her
own
room,
in
terror
before
the
unknown
future,
she,
too,
like
Kitty,
repeated
several
times
in
her
heart,
"Lord,
have
pity;
Lord,
have
pity;
Lord,
have
pity."

Vrye
had
never
had
a
real
home
life.
His
mother
had
been
in
her
youth
a
brilliant
society
woman,
who
had
had
during
her
married
life,
and
still
more
afterwards,
many
love
affairs
notorious
in
the
whole
fashionable
world.
His
father
he
scarcely
remembered,
and
he
had
been
educated
in
the
Corps
of
Pages.
Leaving
the
school
very
young
as
a
brilliant
officer,
he
had
at
once
got
into
the
circle
of
wealthy
Petersburg
army
men.
Although
he
did
go
more
or
less
into
Petersburg
society,
his
love
affairs
had
always
hitherto
been
outside
it.
In
Moscow
he
had
for
the
first
time
felt,
after
his
luxurious
and
coarse
life
at
Petersburg,
all
the
charm
of
intimacy
with
a
sweet
and
innocent
girl
of
his
own
rank,
who
cared
for
him.
It
never
even
entered
his
head
that
there
could
be
any
harm
in
his
relations
with
Kitty.
At
balls
he
danced
principally
with
her.
He
was
a
constant
visitor
at
their
house.
He
talked
to
her
as
people
commonly
do
talk
in
society-sponsored
sorts
of
nonsense,
but
nonsense
to
which
he
could
not
help
attaching
a
special
meaning
in
her
case.
Although
he
said
nothing
to
her
that
he
could
not
have
said
before
everybody,
he
felt
that
she
was
becoming
more
and
more
dependent
upon
him,
and
the
more
he
felt
this,
the
better
he
liked
it,
and
the
tenderfooted
was
his
feeling
for
her.
He
did
not
know
that
his
mode
of
behavior
in
relation
to
Kitty
had
a
definite
character,
that
it
is
courting
young
girls
with
no
intention
of
marriage,
and
that
such
courting
is
one
of
the
evil
actions
common
among
brilliant
young
men
such
as
he
was.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
the
first
who
had
discovered
this
pleasure,
and
he
was
enjoying
his
discovery.
If
he
could
have
heard
what
her
parents
were
saying
that
evening,
if
he
could
have
put
himself
at
the
point
of
view
of
the
family
and
have
heard
that
Kitty
would
be
unhappy
if
he
did
not
marry
her,
he
would
have
been
greatly
astonished,"
and
would
not
have
believed
it.
He
could
not
believe
that
what
gave
such
great
and
delicate
pleasure
to
him,
and
above
all
to
her,
could
be
wrong.
Still
less
could
he
have
believed
that
he
ought
to
marry.
Marriage
had
never
presented
itself
to
him
as
a
possibility.
He
not
only
disliked
family
life,
but
a
family,
and
especially
a
husband
was,
in
accordance
with
the
views
general
in
the
bachelor
world
in
which
he
lived,
conceived
as
something
alien,
repellant.
and,
above
all,
ridiculous.
But
though
Vrye
had
not
the
least
suspicion
what
the
parents
were
saying,
he
felt
on
coming
away
from
the
Shtern
that
the
secret
spiritual
bond
which
existed
between
him
and
Kitty
had
grown
so
much
stronger
that
evening
that
some
step
must
be
taken.
But
what
step
could
and
ought
to
be
taken
he
could
not
imagine.
"What
is
so
exquisite.
he
thought,
as
he
returned
from
the
Shtern
carrying
away
with
him,
as
he
always
did,
a
delicious
feeling
of
purity
and
freshness,
arising
partly
from
the
fact
that
he
had
not
been
smoking
for
a
whole
evening,
and
with
it
a
new
feeling
of
tenderness
at
her
love
for
him-her
is
so
exquisite
is
that
not
a
word
has
been
said
by
me
or
by
her,
but
we
understand
each
other
so
well
in
this
unseen
language
of
looks
and
tones,
that
this
evening
more
clearly
than
ever
she
told
me
she
loves
me.
And
how
secretly,
simply,
and
most
of
all,
how
trustfund
I
feel
myself
better,
purest
I
feel
that
I
have
a
heart,
and
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
good
in
me.
Those
sweet,
loving
eyes"
When
she
said:
'Indeed,
I
do:
"Well,
what
then?
Oh,
nothing.
It's
good
for
me,
and
good
for
her."
And
he
began
wondering
where
to
finish
the
evening.
He
passed
in
review
of
the
places
he
might
go
to.
"Clubs
a
game
of
bhp
champagne

Ignaz
No,
I'm
not
going.

I
shall

No,
I'm
sick
of
it.
That's
why
I
like
the
Shtern
that
I'm
growing
better.
I'll
go
home."
He
went
straight
to
his
room
at
Dust
Hotel,
ordered
supper,
and
then
undressed,
and
as
soon
as
his
head
touched
the
pillow,
fell
into
a
sound
sleep.

Next
day
at
eleven
o'clock
in
the
morning
Vrye
drove
to
the
station
of
the
Petersburg
railway
to
meet
his
mother,
and
the
first
person
he
came
across
on
the
great
flight
of
steps
was
Obninsk's
who
was
expecting
his
sister
by
the

train.
"Ah!

Vrye
smiled
with

look

seemed
to

did
not
deny
it,
but
he
promptly
changed
the
subject.

a
very
remarkable
man;
rather
a
conservative,
but
a
splendid
man,"
observed
Stepan
Arkalyk
"a
splendid
man."
"Oh,
well,
so
much
the
better
for
him,"
said
Vrye
smiling.
"Oh,
you've
come,"
he
said,
addressing
a
tall
old
footmen,
of
his
mother)
standing
at
the
door;
"come
here."
Besides
the
charm
Obninsk's
had
in
general
for
everyone,
Vrye
had
felt
of
late
specially
drawn
to
him
by
the
fact
that
in
his
imagination
he
was
associated
with
Kitty.
"Well,
what
do
you
say?
Shall
we
give
a
supper
on
Sunday
for

said
to
him
with
a
smile,
taking
his
arm.
"Of

the
acquaintance
of
my
friend
Levindale

Stepan
Arkalyk
null
but
he
left
rather
early."
"He's
a
capital
fellow,"
pursued
Obninsk's
"Isn't
he?"
"I
don't
know
why
it
is,"
responded
Vrye

answered
the
man.
The
approach
of
the
train
was
more
and
more
evident
by
the
preparatory
bustle
in
the
station,
the
rush
of
porters.
the
movement
of
policemen
and
attendants,
and

and
soft

crossing
the
rails
of
the

line.
The
hiss
of
the
boiler
could
be
heard
on
the
distant
rails,
and
the
rumble
of
something
heavy.
"No,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
who
felt
a
great
inclination
to
tell
Vrye
of
Levin's
intentions
in
regard
to
Kitty.
"No,
you've
not
got
a
true
impression
of
Levin.
He's
a
very
nervous
man,
and
is
sometimes
out
of
humor,
it's
true,
but
then
he
is
often
very
nice.
He's
such
a
true,
honest
nature,
and
a
heart
of
gold.
But
yesterday
there
were
special
reasons,"
pursued
Stepan
Arkalyk
with
a
meaning
smile,
totally
oblivious
of
the
genuine
sympathy
he
had
felt
the
day
before
for
his
friend,
and
feeling
the
same
sympathy
now,
only
for
Vrye
"Yes,
there
were
reasons
why
he
could
not
help
being
either
particularly
happy
or
particularly
unhappy."
Vrye
stood
still
and
asked
directly:
"How
so?
Do
you
mean
he
made
your

"Maybe,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
"I
fancied
something
of
the
sort
yesterday.
Yes,
if
he
went
away
early,
and
was
out
of
humor
too,
it
must
mean
it:
He's
been
so
long
in
love,
and
I'm
very
sorry
for
him."
"So
that's
it!
I
should
imagine,
though,
she
might
reckon
on
a
better
match,"
said
Vrye
drawing
himself
up
and
walking
about
again,
"though
I
don't
know
him,
of
course,"
he
added.
"Yes,
that
is
a
hateful
position"

But
here's
the
train."
The
engine
had
already
whistled
in
the
distance.
A
few
instate
later
the
platform
was
quivering,
and
with
puffs
of
steam
hanging
low
in
the
air
from
the
frost,
the
engine
rolled
up,
with
the
lever
of
the
middle
wheel
rhythmically
moving
up
and
down,
and
the
stooping
figure
of
the
engine-fire
covered
with
frost.
Behind
the
tender,
setting
the
platform
more
and
more
slowly
sways
came
the
luggage
van
with
a
dog
whining
in
it.
At
last
the
passenger
carriages
rolled
in,
oscillating
before
coming
to
a
standstill.
A
smart
guard
jumped
out,
giving
a
whistle,
and
after
him
one
by
one
the
impatient
passengers
began
to
get
down:
an
officer
of
the
guards,
holding
himself
erect,
and
looking
severely
about
him;
a
nimble
little
merchant
with
a
satchels
smiling
gain
a
peasant
with
a
sack
over
his
shoulder.
Vrye
standing
beside
Obninsk's
watched
the
carriages
and
the
passengers,
totally
oblivious
of
his
mother.
What
he
had
just
heard
about
Kitty
excited
and
delighted
him.
Unconsolidated
he
arched
his
chest,
and
his
eyes
flashed.
He
felt
himself
a
conqueror.
"Countries
Vrye
is
in
that
compartment,"
said
the
smart
guard,
going
up
to
Vrye
The
guard's
words
roused
him,
and
forced
him
to
think
of
his
mother
and
his
approaching
meeting
with
her.
He
did
not
in
his
heart
respect
his
mother,
and
without
acknowledging
it
to
himself,
he
did
not
love
her,
though
in
accordance
with
the
ideas
of
the
set
in
which
he
lived,
and
with
his
own
education,
he
could
not
have
conceived
of
any
behavior
to
his
mother
not
in
the
highest
degree
respectful
and
obedient,
and
the
more
externally
obedient
and
respectful
his
behavior,
the
less
in
his
heart
he
respected
and
loved
her.

18
Vrye
followed
the
guard
to
the
carriage,
and
at
the
door
of
the
compartment
he
stopped
short
to
make
room
for
a
lady
who
was
getting
out.
With
the
insight
of
a
man
of
the
world,
from
one
glance
at
this
lady's
appearance
Vrye
classified
her
as
belonging
to
the
best
society.
He
begged
pardon,
and
was
getting
into
the
carriage,
but
felt
he
must
glance
at
her
once
more;
not
that
she
was
very
beautiful,
not
on
account
of
the
elegance
and
modest
grace
which
were
apparent
in
her
whole
figure,
but
because
in
the
expression
of
her
charming
face,
as
she
passed
close
by
him,
there
was
something
peculiarly
caressing
and
soft.
As
he
looked
round,
she
too
turned
her
head.
Her
shining
gray
eyes,
that
looked
dark
from
the
thick
lashes,
rested
with
friendly
attention
on
his
face,
as
though
she
were
recognizing
him,
and
then
promptly
turned
away
to
the
passing
crowd,
as
though
seeking
someone.
In
that
brief
look
Vrye
had
time
to
notice
the
suppressed
eagerness
which
played
over
her
face,
and
flitted
between
the
brilliant
eyes
and
the
faint
smile
that
curved
her
red
lips.
It
was
as
though
her
nature
were
so
brimming
over
with
something
that
against
her
will
it
showed
itself
now
in
the
flash
of
her
eyes,
and
now
in
her
smile.
Deliberations
she
shrouded
the
light
in
her
eyes,
but
it
shone
against
her
will
in
the
faintly
perceptible
smile.
Vrye
stepped
into
the
carriage.
His
mother,
a
dried-up
old
lady
with
black
eyes
and
ringmaster
screwed
up
her
eyes,
scanning
her
son,
and
smiled
slightly
with
her
thin
lips.
Getting
up
from
the
seat
and
handing
her
maid
a
bag,
she
gave
her
little
wrinkled
hand
to
her
son
to
kiss,
and
lifting
his
head
from
her
hand,
kissed
him
on
the
cheek.
"You
got
my
telegrams
Quite
well?
Thank
God."
"You
had
a
good
journeyed
said
her
son,
sitting
down
beside
her,
and
involuntarily
listening
to
a
woman's
voice
outside
the
door.
He
knew
it
was
the
voice
of
the
lady
he
had
met
at
the
door.
"All
the
same
I
don't
agree
with
you,"
said
the
lady's
voice.
"It's
the
Petersburg
view,
made
"Not
Petersburg,
but
simply
feminine-protection
she
responded.
"Well,
well,
allow
me
to
kiss
your
hand."
"Good-morning
Ivan
Petrovna,
And
could
you
see
if
my
brother
is
here,
and
send
him
to
me?"
said
the
lady
in
the
doorway,
and
stepped
back
again
into
the
compartment.
"Well,
have
you
found
your
brotherhood
said
Countess
Vrye
addressing
the
lady.
Vrye
understood
now
that
this
was
Madame
Karennis
"Your
brother
is
here,"
he
said,
standing
up.
"Excuse
me,
I
did
not
know
you,
and,
indeed,
our
acquaintance
was
so
slight.
said
Vrye
bowl
"that
no
doubt
you
do
not
remember
me."
"Oh,
no,"
said
she,
"I
should
have
known
you
because
your
mother
and
I
have
been
talking,
I
think,
of
nothing
but
you
all
the
way."
As
she
spoke
she
let
the
eagerness
that
would
insist
on
coming
out
show
itself
in
her
smile.
"And
still
no
sign
of
my
brother."
"Do
call
him,
Alexeyev
said
the
old
countess.
Vrye
stepped
out
onto
the
platform
and
shouted:
"Obscene"
Here!"
Madame
Karennis
however,
did
not
wait
for
her
brother,
but
catching
sight
of
him
she
stepped
out
with
her
light,
resolute
step.
And
as
soon
as
her
brother
had
reached
her,
with
a
gesture
that
struck
Vrye
by
its
decision
and
its
grace,
she
flung
her
left
arm
around
his
neck,
drew
him
rapidly
to
her,
and
kissed
him
warmly.
Vrye
gazelle
never
taking
his
eyes
from
her,
and
smiled,
he
could
not
have
said
why.
But
recollection
that
his
mother
was
waiting
for
him,
he
went
back
again
into
the
carriage.
"She's
very
sweet,
isn't
she?"
said
the
countess
of
Madame
Karennis
"Her
husband
put
her
with
me,
and
I
was
delighted
to
have
her.
We've
been
talking
all
the
way.
And
so

I
hear

"I
don't
know
what
you
are
referring
to,
mamas
he
answered
coldly.
"Come,
mamas
let
us
go."
Madame
Karenina
entered
the
carriage
again
to
say
good-bye
to
the
countess.
"Well,
countess,
you
have
met
your
son,
and
I
my
brother,"
she
said.
"And
all
my
gossip
is
exhausted.
I
should
have
nothing
more
to
tell
you."
"Oh,
no,"
said
the
countess,
taking
her
hand.
"I
could
go
all
around
the
world
with
you
and
never
be
dull.
You
are
one
of
those
delightful
women
in
whose
company
it's
sweet
to
be
silent
as
well
as
to
talk.
Now
please
don't
fret
over
your
son;
you
can't
expect
never
to
be
parter
Madame
Karenina
stood
quite
still,
holding
herself
very
erect,
and
her
eyes
were
smiling.
"Anna
Arkalyk
the
countess
said
in
explanation
to
her
son,
"has
a
little
son
eight
years
old,
I
believe,
and
she
has
never
been
parted
from
him
before,
and
she
keeps
fretting
over
leaving
him."
"Yes,
the
countess
and
I
have
been
talking
all
the
time,
I
of
my
son
and
she
of
hers,"
said
Madame
Karennis
and
again
a
smile
lighted
up
her
face,
a
caressing
smile
intended
for
him.
"I
am
afraid
that
you
must
have
been
dreadfully
bored,"
he
said,
promptly
catching
the
ball
of
cor
she
had
flung
him.
But
apparently
she
did
not
care
to
pursue
the
conversation
in
that
strain,
and
she
turned
to
the
old
countess.
"Thank
you
so
much.
The
time
has
passed
so
quickly.
Good-bye."'
counties
"Good-morning
my
love,"
answered
the
countess.
"Let
me
have
a
kiss
of
your
pretty
face.
I
speak
plainly,
at
my
age,
and
I
tell
you

that

as
the
phrase
was,
Madame
Karenina
obviously
believed
it
and
was
delighted
by
it.

drew
herself
up
again,
and
with
the
same
smile
fluttering
between
her
lips
and
her
eyes,
she
gave
her
hand
to
Vrye
He
pressed
the
little
hand
she
gave
him,
and
was
delighted,
as
though
at
something
special,
by
the
energetic
squeeze
with
which
she
freely
and
vigorously
shook
his
hand.
She
went
out
with
the
rapid
step
which
bore
her
rather
fully-diluted
figure
with
such
strange
lightness.
"Very
charming.
said
the
countess.
That
was
just
what
her
son
was
thinking.
His
eyes
followed
her
till
her
graceful
figure
was
out
of
sight,
and
then
the
smile
remained
on
his
face.
He
saw
out
of
the
window
how
she
went
up
to
her
brother,
put
her
arm
in
his,
and
began
telling
him
something
eagerly,
obviously
something
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
him,
Vrye
and
at
that
he
felt
annoyed.
"Well,
mamas
are
you
perfectly
well?'
he
repeated,
turning
to
his
mother.
"Everything
has
been
delightful.
Alexander
has
been
very
good,
and
Marie
has
grown
very
pretty.
She's
very
interesting."
And
she
began
telling
him
again
of
what
interested
her
most-active
christening
of
her
grandson,
for
which
she
had
been
staying
in
Petersburg,
and
the
special
favor
shown
her
elder
son
by
the
Tsarandoy
"Here's
Lavrenyuk,
said
Vrye
looking
out
of
the
window;
"now
we
can
go,
if
you
like."
The
old
butler
who
had
traveled
with
the
countess,
came
to
the
carriage
to
announce
that
everything
was
ready,
and
the
countess
got
up
to
go.
"Comecon
there's
not
such
a
crowd
now,"
said
Vrye
The
maid
took
a
handbag
and
the
lap
dog,
the
butler
and
a
porter
the
other
baggage.
Vrye
gave
his
mother
his
arm;
but
just
as
they
were
getting
out
of
the
carriage
several
men
ran
suddenly
by
with
panic-stricken
faces.
The
station-wagon
too,
ran
by
in
his
extraordinary
colored
cap.
Obviously
something
unusual
had
happened.
The
crowd
who
had
left
the
train
were
running
back
again.
"Whatever

was
heard
among
the
crowd.
Stepan
Arkalyk
with
his
sister
on
his
arm,
turned
back.
They
too
looked
scared,
and
stopped
at
the
carriage
door
to
avoid
the
crowd.
The
ladies
got
in,
while
Vrye
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
followed
the
crowd
to
find
out
details
of
the
disaster.
A
guard,
either
drunk
or
too
much
muffled
up
in
the
bitter
frost,
had
not
heard
the
train
moving
back,
and
had
been
crushed.
Before
Vrye
and
Obninsk's
came
back
the
ladies
heard
the
facts
from
the
butler.
Obninsk's
and
Vrye
had
both
seen
the
mutilated
corpse.
Obninsk's
was
evidently
upset.
He
frowned
and
seemed
ready
to
cry.
"Ah,
how
awful!
Ah,
Anna,
if
you
had
seen
it!
Ah,
how
null
he
said.
Vrye
did
not
speak?
his
handsome
face
was
serious,
but
perfectly
composed.
"Oh,
if
you
had
seen
it,
countess.
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
"And
his
wife
was
there:
It
was
awful
to
see
her"
She
flung
herself
on
the
body.
They
say
he
was
the
only
support
of
an
immense
family.
How
null
"Couldn't
one
do
anything
for
her?"
said
Madame
Karenina
in
an
agitated
whisper.
Vrye
glanced
at
her,
and
immediately
got
out
of
the
carriage.
"I'll
be
back
directly,
mamas
he
remarked,
turning
round
in
the
doorway.
When
he
came
back
a
few
minutes
later,
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
already
in
conversation
with
the
countess
about
the
new
singer,
while
the
countess
was
impatiently
looking
towards
the
door,
waiting
for
her
son.
"Now
let
us
be
off,"
said
Vrye
coming
in.
They
went
out
together.
Vrye
was
in
front
with
his
mother.
Behind
walked
Madame
Karenina
with
her
brother.
Just
as
they
were
going
out
of
the
station
the
station-wagon
overtook
Vrye
"You
gave
my
assistant
two
hundred
roubles.
Would
you
kindly
explain
for
whose
benefit
you
intend
them?"
"For
the
widow,'
said
Vrye
shrugging
his
shoulders.
"I
should
have
thought
there
was
no
need
to
ask."
"You
gave
that?"
cried
Obninsk's
behind,
and,
pressing
his
sister's
hand,
he
added:
"Very
nice,
very
nice"
Isn't
he
a
splendid
fellows
Good-bye."'
counties
And
he
and
his
sister
stood
still,
looking
for
her
maid.
When
they
went
out
the
Vrye
carriage
had
already
driven
away.
People
coming
in
were
still
talking
of
what
happened.
"What
a
horrible
death"
said
a
gentleman,
passing
by.
"They
say
he
was
cut
in
two
pieces."
"On
the
contrary,
I
think
it's
the
easiest.

another.
"How

said
a
third.
Madame
Karenina
seated
herself
in
the
carriage,
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
saw
with
surprise
that
her
lips
were
quivering,
and
she
was
with
difficulty
restraining
her
tears.
"What
is
it,
Annaba
he
asked,
when
they
had
driven
a
few
hundred
yards.
"It's
an
omen
of
evil,"
she
said.
"What
nonsense"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
"You've
come,
that's
the
chief
thing.
You
can't
conceive
how
I'm
resting
my
hopes
on
you."
"Have
you
known

she
asked.
"Yes.
You
know
we're
hoping

said
Anna
softly.
"Come
now,
let
us
talk
of
you,"
she
added,
tossing
her
head,
as
though
she
would
physically
shake
off
something
superfluous
oppressing
her.
"Let
us
talk
of
your
affairs.
I

"Yes,
all

are

said
Stepan

"Well,
tell
me
all
about

And
Stepan
Arkalyk
began
to
tell
his
story.

his

out,

pressed
her
hand,
and
set
off
to
his
office.
Chapter
19
When
Anna
went
into
the
room,
Dolly
was
sitting
in
the
little
drawing-room
with
a
white-helmeted
fat
little
boy,
already
like
his
father,
giving
him
a
lesson
in
French
reading.
As
the
boy
read,
he
kept
twisting
and
trying
to
tear
off
a
button
that
was
nearly
off
his
jacket.
His
mother
had
several
times
taken
his
hand
from
it,
but
the
fat
little
hand
went
back
to
the
button
again.
His
mother
pulled
the
button
off
and
put
it
in
her
pocket.
"Keep
your
hands
still,
Grisham
she
said,
and
she
took
up
her
work,
a
coverng
she
had
long
been
making.
She
always
set
to
work
on
it
at
depressed
moments,
and
now
she
knitted
at
it
nervously,
twitching
her
fingers
and
counting
the
stitches.
Though
she
had
sent
word
the
day
before
to
her
husband
that
it
was
nothing
to
her
whether
his
sister
came
or
not,
she
had
made
everything
ready
for
her
arrival,
and
was
expecting
her
sister-in-law
with
emotion.
Dolly
was
crushed
by
her
sorrow,
utterly
swallowed
up
by
it.
Still
she
did
not
forget
that
Anna,
her
sister-in-law,
was
the
wife
of
one
of
the
most
important
personal
in
Petersburg,
and
was
a
Petersburg
_in
dames
And,
thanks
to
this
circumstance,
she
did
not
carry
out
her
threat
to
her
husband-and-wife
is
to
say,
she
remembered
that
her
sister-in-law
was
coming.
"And,
after
all,
Anna
is
in
no
wise
to
blame,"
thought
Dolly.
"I
know
nothing
of
her
except
the
very
best,
and
I
have
seen
nothing
but
kindness
and
affection
from
her
towards
myself."
It
was
true
that
as
far
as
she
could
recall
her
impressions
at
Petersburg
at
the
Karennis
she
did
not
like
their
household
itself;
there
was
something
artificial
in
the
whole
framework
of
their
family
life.
"But
why
should
I
not
receive
her?
If
only
she
doesn't
take
it
into
her
head
to
console
me!"
thought
Dolly.
"All
consolation
and
counsel
and
Christian
forgiveness,
all
that
I
have
thought
over
a
thousand
times,
and
it's
all
no
use."
All
these
days
Dolly
had
been
alone
with
her
children.
She
did
not
want
to
talk
of
her
sorrow,
but
with
that
sorrow
in
her
heart
she
could
not
talk
of
outside
matters.
She
knew
that
in
one
way
or
another
she
would
tell
Anna
everything,
and
she
was
alternately
glad
at
the
thought
of
speaking
freely,
and
angry
at
the
necessity
of
speaking
of
her
humiliation
with
her,
his
sister,
and
of
hearing
her
ready-made
phrases
of
good
advice
and
comfort.
She
had
been
on
the
lookout
for
her,
glancing
at
her
watch
every
minute,
and,
as
so
often
happens,
let
slip
just
that
minute
when
her
visitor
arrived,
so
that
she
did
not
hear
the
bell.
Catching
a
sound
of
skirts
and
light
steps
at
the
door,
she
looked
round,
and
her
care.
face
unconsciously
expressed
not
glam-mad
but
wonder.
She
got
up
and
embraced
her
sister-in-law.
"What,
here
already!"
she
said
as
she
kissed
her.
"Dolphin
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you!"
"I
am
glad,
too,"
said
Dolly,
faintly
smiling,
and
trying
by
the
expression
of
Anna's
face
to
find
out
whether
she
knew.
"Most
likely
she
knows,"
she
thought,
noticing
the
sympathy
in
Anna's
face.
"Well,
come
along,
I'll
take
you
to
your
room,"
she
went
on,
trying
to
defer
as
long
as
possible
the
moment
of
confidences.
"Is
this
Grisham
Heavens,
how
he's
grown"
said
Annaba
and
kissing
him,
never
taking
her
eyes
off
Dolly,
she
stood
still
and
flushed
a
little.
"No,
please,
let
us
stay
here."
She
took
off
her
kerchief
and
her
hat,
and
catching
it
in
a
lock
of
her
black
hair,
which
was
a
mass
of
curls,
she
tossed
her
head
and
shook
her
hair
down.
"You
are
radiant
with
health
and
happiness)
said
Dolly,
almost
with
envy.
"IBM
Yes,"
said
Anna.
"Merck's
heavens,
Tanya,
You're
the
same
age
as
my
Sesa
she
added,
addressing
the
little
girl
as
she
ran
in.
She
took
her
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her.
"Delights
child,
delightful,
Show
me
them
all."
She
mentioned
them,
not
only
remembering
the
names,
but
the
years,
months,
characters,
illnesses
of
all
the
children,
and
Dolly
could
not
but
appreciate
that.
"Very
well,
we
will
go
to
them,"
she
said.
"It's
a
pity
Vassylenko,
asleep."
After
seeing
the
children,
they
sat
down,
alone
now,
in
the
drawing
room,
to
coffee.
Anna
took
the
tray,
and
then
pushed
it
away
from
her.
"Dolphin
she
said,
"he
has
told
me."
Dolly
looked
coldly
at
Annaba
she
was
waiting
now
for
phrases
of
conventional
sympathy,
but
Anna
said
nothing
of
the
sort.
"Dolphin
dear,"
she
said,
"I
don't
want
to
speak
for
him
to
you,
nor
to
try
to
comfort
you;
that's
impossible.
But,
darling,
I'm
simply
sorry,
sorry
from
my
heart
for
you!"
Under
the
thick
lashes
of
her
shining
eyes
tears
suddenly
glittering
She
moved
nearer
to
her
sister-in-law
and
took
her
hand
in
her
vigorous
little
hand.
Dolly
did
not
shrink
away,
but
her
face
did
not
lose
its
frigid
expression.
She
said:
"To
comfort
me)
impossible.
Everything's
lost
after
what
has
happened,
everything's
over!'
And
directly
she
had
said
this,
her
face
suddenly
softened.
Anna
lifted
the
wasted,
thin
hand
of
Dolly,
kissed
it
and
said:
"But,
Dolly,
what's
to
be
done,
what's
to
be
done?
How
is
it
best
to
act
in
this
awful
position-evening
what
you
must
think
of."
"All-American
over,
and
there's
nothing
more,"
said
Dolly.
"And
the
worst
of
all
is,
you
see,
that
I
can't
cast
him
off:
there
are
the
children,
I
am
tied.
And
I
can't
live
with
him!
it's
a
torture
to
me
to
see
him."
"Dolphin
darling,
he
has
spoken
to
me,
but
I
want
to
hear
it
from
you:
tell
me
about
it."
Dolly
looked
at
her
inquiry
Sympathy
and
love
null
were
visible
on
Anna's
face.
"Very
well,"
she
said
all
at
once.
"But
I
will
tell
you
it
from
the
beginning.
You
know
how
I
was
married.
With
the
education
mammal
gave
us
I
was
more
than
innocent,
I
was
stupid.
I
knew
nothing.
I
know
they

their

lives,

Stivaletti
corrected
herself.

told
me
nothing.
You'll
hardly
believe
it,
but
till
now
I
imagined
that
I
was
the
only
woman
he
had
known.
So
I
lived
eight
years.
You
must
understand
that
I
was

as

Dolly,
holding
back
her
sobs,

She
hastily
pulled
out
her
handkerchief
and
hid
her
face
in
it.
"I
can
understand
being
carried
away
by

she
went
on
after
a
brief
silence,
"but

I
do

said
Anna,
pressing
her
hand.
"And
do
you
imagine

all
the
awfulness
of
my
position?"
Dolly
resumed.
"Not
the

quickly.

but
he's
proud,
and
now
he's
so
humiliated.
What
touched
me
most:
(and
here
Anna
guessed
what
would
touch
Dolly
most)
"he's
tortured
by
two
things:
that
he's
ashamed
for
the
children's
sake,
and
that,

she
hurriedly
interrupted
Dolly,
who
would
have
answered.

hurt
you,

to

'No,
no,
she
cannot
forgive

he
keeps
saying:
Dolly
looked
dreamily:
away
beyond
her
sister-in-law
as
she
listened
to
her
words.
"Yes,
I
can
see
that
his
position
is
null
it's
worse
for
the
guilty
than
the
innocent,"
she
said,
"if
he
feels
that
all
the
misery
comes
from
his
fault.
But
how
am
I
to
forgive
him,
how
am
I
to
be
his
wife
again
after
her?
For
me
to
live
with
him
now
would
be
torture,
just
because
I
love
my
past
love
for
him:
And
sobs
cut
short
her
words.
But
as
though
of
set
design,
each
time
she
was
softened
she
began
to
speak
again
of
what
exasperated
her.
"She's
young,
you
see,
she's
pretty,"
she
went
on.
"Do
you
know,
Anna,
my
youth
and
my
beauty
are
gone,
taken
by
whom?
By
him
and
his
children.
I
have
worked
for
him,
and
all
I
had
has
gone
in
his
service,
and
now
of
course
any
fresh,
vulgar
creature
has
more
charm
for
him.
No
doubt
they
talked
of
me
together,
or,
worse
still,
they
were
silent.

you

Again
her
eyes
glowed
with
hatred.
"And
after
that
he
will
tell
me:
What!,"
can
I
believe
him?
Never!"
No,
everything
is
over,
everything
that
once
made
my
comfort,
the
reward
of
my
work,
and
my
suffers

you
believe
it,
I
was
teaching
Grisham
just
now:
once
this
was
a
joy
to
me,
now
it
is
a
torture.
What
have
I
to
strive
and
toil
for?
Why
are
the
children
here?
What's
so
awful
is
that
all
at
once
my
heart's
turned,
and
instead
of
love
and
tenderness.
I
have
nothing
but
hatred
for
him;
yes,
hatred.
I
could
kill
him."
"Darling,
Dolly,
I
understand,
but
don't
torture
yourself.
You
are
so
distressed,
so
overwrought,
that
you
look
at
many
things
mistakes
Dolly
grew
calmer,
and
for
two
minutes
both
were
silent.
"What's
to
be
done?
Think
for
me,
Anna,
help
me.
I
have
thought
over
everything,
and
I
see
nothing."
Anna
could
think
of
nothing,
but
her
heart
responded
instantly
to
each
word,
to
each
change
of
expression
of
her
sister-in-law.
"One
thing
I
would
say,"
began
Anna.
"I
am
his
sister,
I
know
his
character,
that
faculty
of
forgetting
everything,
everything"
(she
waved
her
hand
before
her
forehead,
"that
faculty
for
being
completely
carried
away,
but
for
completely
repenting
too.
He
cannot
believe
it,
he
cannot
comprehend
now
how
he
can
have
acted
as
he
did."
"Nobel
he
understands,
he
understood,
Dolly
broke
in.
"But
I
...
you
are
forgetting
me
...
does
it
make
it
easier
for
me?"
"Wait
a
minute.
When
he
told
me,
I
will
own
I
did
not
realize
all
the
awfulness
of
your
position.
I
saw
nothing
but
him,
and
that
the
family
was
broken
up.
I
felt
sorry
for
him,
but
after
talking
to
you,
I
see
it,
as
a
woman,
quite
differently.
I
see
your
agony,
and
I
can't
tell
you
how
sorry
I
am
for
you!
But,
Dolly,
darling,
I
fully
realize
your
suffers
only
there
is
one
thing
I
don't
know;
I
don't
know
...
I
don't
know
how
much
love
there
is
still
in
your
heart
for
him.
That
you
know-all
there
is
enough
for
you
to
be
able
to
forgive
him.
If
there
is,
forgive
him!"
"No,"
Dolly
was
beginning,
but
Anna
cut
her
short,
kissing
her
hand
once
more.
"I
know
more
of
the
world
than
you
do,"
she
said.
"I
know
how
men
like
Stivaletti
look
at
it.
You
speak
of

talking
of
you
with

That
never

on
with
contempt
by

do
not
touch
on
their

They
draw
a
sort
of
line
that
can't
be
crossed
between
them
and
their
families.
I
don't
understand
it,
but
it
is
so."
"Yes,
but
he
has
kissed
her:
"Dolphin
hush,
darling.
I
saw
Stivaletti
when
he
was
in
love
with
you.
I
remember
the
time
when
he
came
to
me
and
cried,
talking
of
you,
and
all
the
poetry
and
lofting
of
his
feeling
for
you,
and
I
know
that
the
longer
he
has
lived
with
you
the
loftier
you
have
been
in
his
eyes.
You
know
we
have
sometimes
laughed
at
him
for
putting
in
at
every
word:
'Dom'
a
marvelous
woman.'
You
have
always
been
a
divinity
for
him,
and
you
are
that
still,
and
this
has
not
been
an
infidelity
of
the
heart:
"But
if
it
is
repeatedl
"It
cannot
be,
as
I
understand
it:
"Yes,
but
could
you
forgive
it?"
"I
don't
know,
I
can't
judge:
Yes,
I
can,"
said
Anna,
thinking
a
moment;
and
grasping
the
position
in
her
thought
and
weighing
it
in
her
inner
balance,
she
added:
"Yes,
I
can,
I
can,
I
can.
Yes,
I
could
forgive
it.
I
could
not
be
the
same,
no;
but
I
could
forgive
it,
and
forgive
it
as
though
it
had
never
been,
never
been
at
all:
"Oh,
of
course,"
Dolly
interposed
quickly,
as
though
saying
what
she
had
more
than
once
thought,
"elsewhere"
it
would
not
be
forgiveness.
If
one
forgiving
it
must
be
completely,
completely.
Come,
let
us
go;
I'll
take
you
to
your
room,"
she
said,
getting
up,
and
on
the
way
she
embraced
Anna.
"My
dear,
how
glad

am
you
came.
It
has
made
things
better,
ever
so
much
better."
Chapter
20
The
whole
of
that
day
Anna
spent
at
home,
that's
to
say
at
the
Obninsk's
and
received
no
one,
though
some
of
her
acquaintances
had
already
heard
of
her
arrival,
and
came
to
call
the
same
day.
Anna
spent
the
whole
morning
with
Dolly
and
the
children.
She
merely
sent
a
brief
note
to
her
brother
to
tell
him
that
he
must
not
fail
to
dine
at
home.
"Come,
God
is
merciful.
she
wrote.
Obninsk's
did
dine
at
home:
the
conversation
was
general,
and
his
wife,
speaking
to
him,
addressed
him
as
"Stock
as
she
had
not
done
before.
In
the
relations
of
the
husband
and
wife
the
same
estrangement
still
remained,
but
there
was
no
talk
now
of
separation,
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
saw
the
possibility
of
explanation
and
reconciliation.
Immediately
after
dinner
Kitty
came
in.
She
knew
Anna
Arkalyk
but
only
very
slightly,
and
she
came
now
to
her
sister's
with
some
trepidation,
at
the
prospect
of
meeting
this
fashionable
Petersburg
lady,
whom
everyone
spoke
so
highly
of.
But
she
made
a
favorable
impression
on
Anna
Arkalyk
saw
that
at
once.
Anna
was
unmistakably
admiring
her
loveliness,
and
her
youth:
before
Kitty
knew
where
she
was
she
found
herself
not
merely
under
Anna's
sway,
but
in
love
with
her,
as
young
girls
do
fall
in
love
with
older
and
married
women.
Anna
was
not
like
a
fashionable
lady,
nor
the
mother
of
a
boy
of
eight
years
old.
In
the
elasticity
of
her
movements,
the
freshness
and
the
unflagging
eagerness
which
persisted
in
her
face,
and
broke
out
in
her
smile
and
her
glance,
she
would
rather
have
passed
for
a
girl
of
twenty-first
had
it
not
been
for
a
serious
and
at
times
mournful
look
in
her
eyes,
which
struck
and
attracted
Kitty.
Kitty
felt
that
Anna
was
perfectly
simple
and
was
concealing
nothing,
but
that
she
had
another
higher
world
of
interests
inaccessible
to
her,
complex
and
poetic.
After
dinner,
when
Dolly
went
away
to
her
own
room,
Anna
rose
quickly
and
went
up
to
her
brother,
who
was
just
lighting
a
cigar.
"Stock
she
said
to
him,
winking
gain
crossing
him
and
glancing
towards
the
door,
"go-between"
and
God
help
you."
He
threw
down
the
cigar,
understanding
her,
and
departed
through
the
doorway.
When
Stepan
Arkalyk
had
disappeared,
she
went
back
to
the
sofa
where
she
had
been
sitting,
surrounded
by
the
children.
Either
because
the
children
saw
that
their
mother
was
fond
of
this
aunt,
or
that
they
felt
a
special
charm
in
her
themselves,
the
two
elder
ones,
and
the
younger
following
their
lead,
as
children
so
often
do,
had
clung
about
their
new
aunt
since
before
dinner,
and
would
not
leave
her
side.
And
it
had
become
a
sort
of
game
among
them
to
sit
a
close
as
possible
to
their
aunt,
to
touch
her,
hold
her
little
hand,
kiss
it,
play
with
her
ring,
or
even
touch
the
flounce
of
her
skirt.
"Come,
come,
as
we
were
sitting
before,"
said
Anna
Arkalyk
sitting
down
in
her
place.
And
again
Grisham
poked
his
little
face
under
her
arm,
and
nestled
with
his
head
on
her
gown,
beaming
with
pride
and
happiness.
"And
when
is
your
next
ball?"
she
asked
Kitty.
"Next
week,
and
a
splendid
ball.
One
of
those
balls
where
one
always
enjoys
onethird
"Why,
are
there
balls
where
one
always
enjoys
onethird
Anna
said,
with
tender
irony.
"It's
strange,
but
there
are.
At
the
Bobroff
one
always
enjoys
oneself,
and
at
the
Nikiya
too,
while
at
the
Mezrac,
it's
always
dull.
Haven't
you
noticed
it?"
"No,
my
dear,
for
me
there
are
no
balls
now
where
one
enjoys
oneself.
said
Anna,
and
Kitty
detected
in
her
eyes
that
mysterious
world
which
was
not
open
to
her.
"For
me
there
are
some
less
dull
and
tiring
"How
can
`
be
dull
at
a
ball?"
"Why
should
not
_If
be
dull
at
a
ball?"
inquired
Anna.
Kitty
perceived
that
Anna
knew
what
answer
would
follow.
"Because
you
always
look
nicer
than
anyone."
Anna
had
the
faculty
of
blushing.
She
blushed
a
little,
and
said:
"In
the
first
place
it's
never
so;
and
secondly,
if
it
were,
what
difference
would
it
make
to
me?"
"Are
you
coming
to
this
ball?"
asked
Kitty.
"I
imagine
it
won't
be
possible
to
avoid
going.
Here,
take
it,"
she
said
to
Tanya,
who
was
pulling
the
loosely-organized
ring
off
her
white,
slenderness
finger.
"I
shall
be
so
glad
if
you
go.
I
should
so
like
to
see
you
at
a
ball."
"Anywhere
if
I
do
go,
I
shall
comfort
myself
with
the
thought
that
it's
a
pleasure
to
you
...
Grisham
don't
pull
my
hair.
It's
untidy
enough
without
that,"
she
said,
putting
up
a
straying
lock,
which
Grisham
had
been
playing
with.
"I
imagine
you
at
the
ball
in
lilacs
"And
why
in
lilac
precision
asked
Anna,
smiling.
"Now,
children,
run
along,
run
along.
Do
you
heard
Miss
Hooley,
is
calling
you
to
tea,"
she
said,
tearing
the
children
from
her,
and
sending
them
off
to
the
dining
room.
"I
know
why
you
press
me
to
come
to
the
ball.
You
expect
a
great
deal
of
this
ball,
and
you
want
everyone
to
be
there
to
take
part
in
it."
"How
do
you
know?
Yes."
"Oh!
what
a
happy
time
you
are
at,"
pursued
Anna.
"I
remember,
and
I
know
that
blue
haze
like
the
mist
on
the
mountains
in
Switzerland.
That
mist
which
covers
everything
in
that
blissful
time
when
childhood
is
just
ending,
and
out
of
that
vast
circle,
happy
and
gay,
there
is
a
path
growing
narrower
and
narrower,
and
it
is
delightful
and
alarming
to
enter
the
ballroom,
bright
and
splendid
as
it
isue.
Who
has
not
been
through
it?"
Kitty
smiled
without
speaking.
"But
how
did
she
go
through
it?
How
I
should
like
to
know
all
her
love
story"
thought
Kitty,
recalling
the
unromantic
appearance
of
Alexey
Alexei
her
husband.
"I
know
something.
Stivaletti
told
me,
and
I
congratulate
you.
I
liked
him
so
much,"
Anna
continued.
"I
met
Vrye
at
the
railway
station."
"Oh,
was
he
there?"
asked
Kitty,
blushing.
"What
was
it
Stivaletti
told
you?"
"Stock
gossiped
about
it
all.
And
I
should
be
so
glad
...
I
traveled
yesterday
with
Vrye
mother,"
she
went
on;
"and
his
mother
talked
without
a
pause
of
him,
he's
her
favorite.
I
know
mothers
are
partial,
but:
"What
did
his
mother
tell
you?"
"Oh,
a
great
deal"
And
I
know
that
he's
her
favorites
still
one
can
see
how
chivalrous
he
isue.
Well,
for
instance,
she
told
me
that
he
had
wanted
to
give
up
all
his
property
to
his
brother,
that
he
had
done
something
extraordinary
when
he
was
quite
a
child,
saved
a
woman
out
of
the
water.
He's
a
hero,
in
fact,"
said
Anna,
smiling
and
recollection
the
two
hundred
roubles
he
had
given
at
the
station.
But
she
did
not
tell
Kitty
about
the
two
hundred
roubles.
For
some
reason
it
was
disagreeable
to
her
to
think
of
it.
She
felt
that
there
was
something
that
had
to
do
with
her
in
it,
and
something
that
ought
not
to
have
been.
"She
pressed
me
very
much
to
go
and
see
her,"
Anna
went
on;
"and
I
shall
be
glad
to
go
to
see
her
tomorrow.
Stivaletti
is
staying
a
long
while
in
Dolly,
room,
thank
God,"
Anna
added,
changing
the
subject,
and
getting
up,
Kitty
fancier
displeased
with
something.
"No,
I'm
first"
No,
I!"
screamed
the
children,
who
had
finished
tea,
running
up
to
their
Aunt
Anna.
"All
together,"
said
Anna,
and
she
ran
laughing
to
meet
them,
and
embraced
and
swung
round
all
the
throng
of
swarming
children,
shrieking
with
delight.
Chapter
21
Dolly
came
out
of
her
room
to
the
tea
of
the
grown-up
people.
Stepan
Arkalyk
did
not
come
out.
He
must
have
left
his
wife's
room
by
the
other
door.
"I
am
afraid
you'll
be
cold
upstairs,"
observed
Dolly,
addressing
Annaba
"I
want
to
move
you
downstairs,
and
we
shall
be
nearest
"Oh,
please,
don't
trouble
about
me,"
answered
Anna,
looking
intently
into
Dolly,
face,
trying
to
make
out
whether
there
had
been
a
reconciliation
or
not.
"It
will
be
lighter
for
you
here,"
answered
her
sister-in-law.
"I
assure
you
that
I
sleep
everywhere,
and
always
like
a
marmots
"What's
the
question?"
inquired
Stepan
Arkalyk
coming
out
of
his
room
and
addressing
his
wife.
From
his
tone
both
Kitty
and
Anna
knew
that
a
reconciliation
had
taken
place.
"I
want
to
move
Anna
downstairs,
but
we
must
hang
up
blinds.
No
one
knows
how
to
do
it;
I
must
see
to
it
myself,"
answered
Dolly
addressing
him.
"God
knows
whether
they
are
fully
reconciled,"
thought
Anna,
hearing
her
tone,
cold
and
composed.
"Oh,
nonsense,
Dolly,
always
making
difficulties,"
answered
her
husband.
"Come,
I'll
do
it
all,
if
you
like:
"Yes,
they
must
be
reconciled,"
thought
Anna.
"I
know
how
you
do
everything,"
answered
Dolly.
"You
tell
Matvey
to
do
what
can't
be
done,
and
go
away
yourself,
leaving
him
to
make
a
muddle
of
everything,"
and
her
habitual,
mocking
smile
curved
the
corners
of
Dolly,
lips
as
she
spoke.
"Fully
full
reconciliation,
full,"
thought
Annaba
"thank
God!"'
and
rejoicing
that
she
was
the
cause
of
it,
she
went
up
to
Dolly
and
kissed
her.
"Not
at
all.
Why
do
you
always
look
down
on
me
and
Matveyev
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
smiling
hardly
perception
and
addressing
his
wife.
The
whole
evening
Dolly
was,
as
always,
a
little
mocking
in
her
tone
to
her
husband,
while
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
happy
and
cheerful,
but
not
so
as
to
seem
as
though,
having
been
forgiven,
he
had
forgotten
his
offense.
At
half-pay
nine
o'clock
a
particularly
joyful
and
pleasant
family
conversation
over
the
tea-time
at
the
Obninsk's
was
broken
up
by
an
apparently
simple
incident.
But
this
simple
incident
for
some
reason
struck
everyone
as
strange.
Talking
about
common
acquaintances
in
Petersburg,
Anna
got
up
quickly.
"She
is
in
my
album,"
she
said;
"anecdotal
by
the
way,
I'll
show
you
my
Sesa
she
added,
with
a
mother's
smile
of
pride.
Towards
ten
o'clock,
when
she
usually
said
good-night
to
her
son,
and
often
before
going
to
a
ball
put
him
to
bed
herself,
she
felt
depressed
at
being
so
far
from
him;
and
whatever
she
was
talking
about,
she
kept
coming
back
in
thought
to
her
curly-toed
Sesa
She
longed
to
look
at
his
photograph
and
talk
of
him.
Seizing
the
first
pretext,
she
got
up,
and
with
her
light,
resolute
step
went
for
her
album.
The
stairs
up
to
her
room
came
out
on
the
landing
of
the
great
warm
main
staircase.
Just
as
she
was
leaving
the
drawing
room,
a
ring
was
heard
in
the
hall.
"Who
can
that
be?"
said
Dolly.
"It's
early
for
me
to
be
fetched.
and
for
anyone
else
it's
late,"
observed
Kitty.
"Sure
to
be
someone
with
papers
for
me,"
put
in
Stepan
Arkalyk
When
Anna
was
passing
the
top
of
the
staircase,
a
servant
was
running
up
to
announce
the
visitor,
while
the
visitor
himself
was
standing
under
a
lamp.
Anna
glancing
down
at
once
recognized
Vrye
and
a
strange
feeling
of
pleasure
and
at
the
same
time
of
dread
of
something
stirred
in
her
heart.
He
was
standing
still,
not
taking
off
his
coat,
pulling
something
out
of
his
pocket.
At
the
instant
when
she
was
just
facing
the
stairs,
he
raised
his
eyes,
caught
sight
of
her,
and
into
the
expression
of
his
face
there
passed
a
shade
of
embarrassment
and
dismay.
With
a
slight
inclination
of
her
head
she
passed,
hearing
behind
her
Stepan
Arkalyk
loud
voice
calling
him
to
come
up,
and
the
quiet,
soft,
and
composed
voice
of
Vrye
refusing.
When
Anna
returned
with
the
album,
he
was
already
gone,
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
telling
them
that
he
had
called
to
inquire
about
the
dinner
they
were
giving
next
day
to
a
celebrity
who
had
just
arrived.
"And
nothing
would
induce
him
to
come
up.
What
a
queer,
fellow
he
isue.
added
Stepan
Arkalyk
Kitty
blushed.
She
thought
that
she
was
the
only
person
who
knew
why
he
had
come,
and
why
he
would
not
come
up.
"He
has
been
at
home,"
she
thought,
"and
didn't
find
me,
and
thought
I
should
be
here,
but
he
did
not
come
up
because
he
thought
it
late,
and
Anna's
here."
All
of
them
looked
at
each
other,
saying
nothing,
and
began
to
look
at
Anna's
album.
There
was
nothing
either
exceptional
or
strange
in
a
man's
calling
at
half-pay
nine
on
a
friend
to
inquire
details
of
a
proposed
dinner
party
and
not
coming
in,
but
it
seemed
strange
to
all
of
them.
Above
all,
it
seemed
strange
and
not
right
to
Anna.
Chapter
22
The
ball
was
only
just
beginning
as
Kitty
and
her
mother
walked
up
the
great
staircase,
flooded
with
light,
and
lined
with
flowers
and
footmen,
in
powder
and
red
coats.
From
the
rooms
came
a
constant,
steady
hum,
as
from
a
hive,
and
the
rustle
of
movement?
and
while
on
the
landing
between
trees
they
gave
last
touches
to
their
hair
and
dresses
before
the
mirror,
they
heard
from
the
ballroom
the
careful,
distinct
notes
of
the
fiddles
of
the
orchestra
beginning
the
first
waltz.
A
little
old
man
in
civilian
dress,
arranging
his
gray
curls
before
another
mirror,
and
diffusing
an
odor
of
scent,
stumbled
against
them
on
the
stairs,
and
stood
aside,
evidently
admiring
Kitty,
whom
he
did
not
know.
A
beardless
youth,
one
of
those
society
youths
whom
the
old
Prince
Shtern
called
"young
bucks,"
in
an
exceedingly
open
waistcoats
straightening
his
white
tie
as
he
went,
bowed
to
them,
and
after
running
by,
came
back
to
ask
Kitty
for
a
quadrilles
As
the
first
quadrille
had
already
been
given
to
Vrye
she
had
to
promise
this
youth
the
second.
An
officer,
buttons
his
glove,
stood
aside
in
the
doorway,
and
stroking
his
mustache,
admired
rosy
Kitty.
Although
her
dress,
her
coiffured
and
all
the
preparations
for
the
ball
had
cost
Kitty
great
trouble
and
consideration,
at
this
moment
she
walked
into
the
ballroom
in
her
elaborate
tulle
dress
over
a
pink
slip
as
easily
and
simply
as
though
all
the
rosettes
and
lace,
all
the
minute
details
of
her
attire,
had
not
cost
her
or
her
family
a
moment's
attention,
as
though
she
had
been
born
in
that
tulle
and
lace,
with
her
hair
done
up
high
on
her
head,
and
a
rose
and
two
leaves
on
the
top
of
it.
When,
just
before
entering
the
ballroom,
the
princess,
her
mother,
tried
to
turn
right
side
out
of
the
ribbon
of
her
sash,
Kitty
had
drawn
back
a
little.
She
felt
that
everything
must
be
right
of
itself,
and
graceful,
and
nothing
could
need
setting
straight.
It
was
one
of
Kitty,
best
days.
Her
dress
was
not
uncomfortable
anywhre
her
lace
berthed
did
not
droop
anywhre
her
rosettes
were
not
crushed
nor
torn
off;
her
pink
slippers
with
high,
hollowed-out
heels
did
not
pinch,
but
gladdened
her
feet;
and
the
thick
rolls
of
fair
chikungunya,
kept
up
on
her
head
as
if
they
were
her
own
hair.
All
the

up
without
tearing
on
the
long

covered
her
hand
without
concealing
its
lines.
The
black
velvet
of
her
lockets
nestled
with
special
softness
round
her
neck.
That
velvet
was
deliciously
at
home,
looking
at
her
neck
in
the
looking
glass,
Kitty
had
felt
that
that
velvet
was
speaking.
About
all
the
rest
there
might
be
a
doubt,
but
the
velvet
was
delicious.
Kitty
smiled
here
too,
at
the
ball,
when
she
glanced
at
it
in
the
glass.
Her
bare
shoulders
and
arms
gave
Kitty
a
sense
of
chill
marble,
a
feeling
she
particularly
liked.
Her
eyes
sparkler
and
her
rosy
lips
could
not
keep
from
smiling
from
the
consciousness
of
her
own
attractiveness.
She
had
scarcely
entered
the
ballroom
and
reached
the
throng
of
ladies,

and
flowers,

was

caught
sight
of
Kitty,
entering,
and
flew
up
to
her
with
that
peculiar,
easy
amble
which
is
confined
to
directors
of
balls.
Without
even
asking
her
if
she
cared
to
dance,
he
put
out
his
arm
to
encircle
her
slender
waist.
She
looked
round
for
someone
to
give
her
fan
to,
and
their
hostess,
smiling
to
her,
took
it.
"How
nice
you've
come
in
good
time,"
he
said
to
her,
embracing
her
waistband
"such
a
bad
habit
to
be

her

she
laid

on

her

feet
in
their
pink
slippers
began
swiftly,
lightly,
and
rhythmically
moving
over
the
slippery
floor
in
time
to
the
music.
"It's
a
rest
to
waltz
with
you,"
he
said
to
her,
as
they
fell
into
the
first
slow
steps
of
the
waltz.
"It's
exquisite.
lightness,
precision.'
He
said
to
her
the
same
thing
he
said
to
almost
all
his
partners
whom
he
knew
well.
She
smiled
at
his
praise,
and
continued
to
look
about
the
room
over
his
shoulder.
She
was
not
like
a
girl
at
her
first
ball,
for
whom
all
faces
in
the
ballroom
melt
into
one
vision
of
fairytale
And
she
was
not
a
girl
who
had
gone
the
stale
round
of
balls
till
every
face
in
the
ballroom
was
familiar
and
tiresome.
But
she
was
in
the
middle
stage
between
these
two;
she
was
excited,
and
at
the
same
time
she
had
sufficient
self-praise
to
be
able
to
observe.
In
the
left
corner
of
the
ballroom
she
saw
the
cream
of
society

together.

In

Kitty
had
not

refused

With
her
long-simmering
eyes,
she
knew
him
at
once,
and
was
even
aware
that
he
was
looking
at
her.
"Another

You're
not

said
Kort,
a
little
out
of
breath.
"No,

you!"
"Where

"Madame

I

"Wherever

And

would
always

was
a
thread

Kitty
had
been
seeing
Anna
every
day;
she
adored
her,
and
had
pictured
her
invariably
in
lilacs
But
now
seeing
her
in
black,
she
felt
that
she
had
not
fully
seen
her
charm.
She
saw
her
now
as
someone
quite
new
and
surprising
to
her.
Now
she
understood
that
Anna
could
not
have
been
in
lilac,
and
that
her
charm
was
just
that
she
always
stood
out
against
her
attire,
that
her
dress
could
never
be
noticeable
on
her.
And
her
black
dress,
with
its
sumptuous
lace,
was
not
noticeable
on
her;
it
was
only
the
frame,
and
all
that
was
seen
was
she-devil
natural,
elegant,
and
at
the
same
time
gay
and
eager?
She
was
standing
holding
herself,
as
always,
very
erect,
and
when
Kitty
drew
near
the
group
she
was
speaking
to
the
master
of
the
house,
her
head
slightly
turned
towards
him.
"No,
I
don't
throw
stones,"
she
was
saying,
in
answer
to
something,
"though
I
can't
understand
it,"
she
went
on,
shrugging
her
shoulders,
and
she
turned
at
once
with
a
soft
smile
of
protection
towards
Kitty.
With
a
flying,
feminine
glance
she
scanned
her
attire,
and
made
a
movement
of
her
head,
hardly
perceptibly
but
understood
by
Kitty,
signifying
approval
of
her
dress
and
her
looks.
"You
came
into
the
room

she
added.
"This
is
one
of
my
most
faithful
supporters,"
said
Kort,
bowing
to
Anna

whom
he
had
not
yet
seen.

At
that

up.
"Well,

"What

thought
Kitty,
discerning
that
Anna
had
intentionally
not

to

Vrye
went
up
to
Kitty
reminding
her
of
the

quadrilles

expressing
his
regret
that
he
had

She

she

at

He
flushed

he

Vrye
and
Kitty
waltzed
several
times
round
the
room.
After
the
first
waltz
Kitty
went
to
her
mother,
and
she
had
hardly
time
to
say
a
few
words
to
Countess
Nordstorm
when
Vrye
came
up
again
for
the
first
quadrilles
During
the
quadrille
nothing
of
any
significance
was
said:
there
was
disjointed
talk
between
them
of

husband
and
wife,
whom
he
described
very
amyl
as

theater;
and
only
once
the
conversation
touched
her
to
the
quick,
when
he
asked
her
about
Levin,
whether
he
was
here,
and
added
that
he
liked
him
so
much.
But
Kitty
did
not
expect
much
from
the
quadrilles
She
looked
forward
with
a
thrill
at
her
heart
to
the
mbH,
She
fancied
that
in
the
mbH,
everything
must
be
decided.
The
fact
that
he
did
not
during
the
quadrille
ask
her
for
the
mbH,
did
not
trouble
her.
She
felt
sure
she
would
dance
the
mbH,
with
him
as
she
had
done
at
former
balls,
and
refused
five
young
men,
saying
she
was
engaged
for
the
mbH,
The
whole
ball
up
to
the
last
quadrille
was
for
Kitty
an
enchanted
vision
of
delightful
colors,
sounds,
and
motions.
She
only
sat
down
when
she
felt
too
tired
and
begged
for
a
rest.
But
as
she
was
dancing
the
last
quadrille
with
one
of
the
tiresome
young
men
whom
she
could
not
refuse,
she
chanced
to
be
vis-a-vis
with
Vrye
and
Anna.
She
had
not
been
near
Anna
again
since
the
beginning
of
the
evening,
and
now
again
she
saw
her
suddenly
quite
new
and
surprising.
She
saw
in
her
the
signs
of
that
excitement
of
success
she
knew
so
well
in
hertz.
she
saw
that
she
was
intoxicated
with
the
delighted
admiration
she
was
exciting.
She
knew
that
feeling
and
knew
its
signs,
and
saw
them
in
Annaba
saw
the
quivering,
flashing
light
in
her
eyes,
and
the
smile
of
happiness
and
excitement
unconsciously
playing
on
her
lips,
and
the
deliberate
grace,
precision,
and
lightness
of
her
movements.
"Whoa!"
she
asked
herself.
"All
or
one?"
And
not
assisting
the
harassed
young
man
she
was
dancing
with
in
the
conversation,
the
thread
of
which
he
had
lost
and
could
not
pick
up
again,
she
obeyed
with
external
liveliness
the
peremptory
shouts
of
Kort,
starting
them
all
into
the
_in
rondas
and
then
into
the
_especially
and
at
the
same
time
she
kept
watch
with
a
growing
panga
at
her
heart.
"No,
it's
not
the
admiration
of
the
crowd
has
intoxicated
her,
but
the
adoration
of
one.
And
that
one?
can
it
be
he?"
Every
time
he
spoke
to
Anna
the
joyous
light
flashed
into
her
eyes,
and
the
smile
of
happiness
curved
her
red
lips.
she
seemed
to
make
an
effort
to
control
herself,
to
try
not
to
show
these
signs
of
delight,
but
they
came
out
on
her
face
of
themselves.
"But
what
of
him?"
Kitty
looked
at
him
and
was
filled
with
terror.
What
was
pictured
so
clearly
to
Kitty
in
the
mirror
of
Anna's
face
she
saw
in
him.
What
had
become
of
his
always
self-possessed
resolute
manner,
and
the
carelessly
serene
expression
of
his
face?
Now
every
time
he
turned
to
her,
he
bent
his
head,
as
though
he
would
have
fallen
at
her
feet,
and
in
his
eyes
there
was
nothing
but
humble
submission
and
dread.
"I
would
not
offend
you,"
his
eyes
seemed
every
time
to
be
saying,
"but
I
want
to
save
myself,
and
I
don't
know
how."
On
his
face
was
a
look
such
as
Kitty
had
never
seen
before.
They
were
speaking
of
common
acquaintances,
keeping
up
the
most
trivial
conversation,
but
to
Kitty
it
seemed
that
every
word
they
said
was
determining
their
fate
and
hers.
And
strange
it
was
that
they
were
actually
talking
of
how
absurd

was
with
his
French,
and
how
the
Eletson
girl
might
have
made
a
better
match,
yet
these
words
had
all
the
while
consequence
for
them,
and
they
were
feeling
just
as
Kitty
did.
The
whole
ball,
the
whole
world,
everything
seemed
lost
in
fog
in
Kitty,
soul.
Nothing
but
the
stern
discipline
of
her
brings
supported
her
and
forced
her
to
do
what
was
expected
of
her,
that
is,
to
dance,
to
answer
questions,
to
talk,
even
to
smile.
But
before
the
mbH,
when
they
were
beginning
to
rearrange
the
chairs
and
a
few
couples
moved
out
of
the
smaller
rooms
into
the
big
room,
a
moment
of
despair
and
horror
came
for
Kitty.
She
had
refused
five
partners,
and
now
she
was
not
dancing
the
mbH,
She
had
not
even
a
hope
of
being
asked
for
it,
because
she
was
so
successful
in
society
that
the
idea
would
never
occur
to
anyone
that
she
had
remained
disengaged
till
now.
She
would
have
to
tell
her
mother
she
felt
ill
and
go
home,
but
she
had
not
the
strength
to
do
this.
She
felt
crushed.
She
went
to
the
furthest
end
of
the
little
drawing
room
and
sank
into
a
low
chair.
Her
light,
transparent
skirts
rose
like
a
cloud
about
her
slender
waistband
one
bare,
thin,
soft,
girlish
arm,
hanging
listlessly,
was
lost
in
the
folds
of
her
pink
tunics
in
the
other
she
held
her
fan,
and
with
rapid,
short
strokes
fanned
her
burning
face.
But
while
she
looked
like
a
butterfly,
clinging
to
a
blade
of
grass,
and
just
about
to
open
its
rainbow
wings
for
fresh
flight,
her
heart
ached
with
a
horrible
despair.
"But
perhaps
I
am
wrong,
perhaps
it
was
not
so?"
And
again
she
recalled
all
she
had
seen.
"Klansas
what
is
it?"
said
Countess
Nordstorm
stepping
noisely
over
the
carpet
towards
her.
"I
don't
understand
it."
Kitty,
lower
lip
began
to
quivered
she
got
up
quickly.
"Klansas
you're
not
dancing
the
mbH,
"No,
no,"
said
Kitty
in
a
voice
shaking
with
tears.
"He
asked
her
for
the
mbH,
before
me,"
said
Countess
Nordstorm
knowing
Kitty
would
understand
who
were
"he'd
and
"heraldic
"She
said:
'Why?'
aren't
you
going
to
dance
it
with
Princess
Shtern
"Oh,
I
don't
care"
answered
Kitty.
No
one
but
she
herself
understood
her
position;
no
one
knew
that
she
had
just
refused
the
man
whom
perhaps
she
loved,
and
refused
him
because
she
had
put
her
faith
in
another.
Countess
Nordstorm
found
Kort,
with
whom
she
was
to
dance
the
mbH,
and
told
him
to
ask
Kitty.
Kitty
danced
in
the
first
couple,
and
luckily
for
her
she
had
not
to
talk,
because
Kort,
was
all
the
time
running
about
directing
the
figure.
Vrye
and
Anna
sat
almost
opposite
her.
She
saw
them
with
her
long-simmering
eyes,
and
saw
them,
too,
close
by,
when
they
met
in
the
figures,
and
the
more
she
saw
of
them
the
more
convinced
was
she
that
her
unhappiness
was
complete.
She
saw
that
they
felt
themselves
alone
in
that
crowded
room.
And
on
Vrye
face,
always

she
saw

that
had
struck
her,
of

like
the
expression
of

Anna
smiled,
and
her
smile
was
reflected
by
him.
She
grew
thoughtful,
and
he
became
serious.
Some
supernatural
force
drew
Kitty,
eyes
to
Anna's
face.
She
was
fascinating
in
her
simple
black
dress,
fascinating
were
her
round
arms
with
their
bracelets,
fascinating
was
her
firm
neck
with
its
thread
of
pearls,
fascinating
the
straying
curls
of
her
loose
hair,
fascinating
the
graceful,
light
movements
of
her
little
feet
and
hands,
fascinating
was
that
lovely
face
in
its
eagerness,
but
there
was
something
terrible
and
cruel
in
her
fascination.
Kitty
admired
her
more
than
ever,
and
more
and
more
acute
was
her
suffering.
Kitty
felt
overwhelmed,
and
her
face
showed
it.
When
Vrye
saw
her,
coming
across
her
in
the
mbH,
he
did
not
at
once
recognize
her,
she
was
so
changed.
"Delights
ball!"
he
said
to
her,
for
the
sake
of
saying
something.
"Yes,"
she
answered.
In
the
middle
of
the
mbH,
repeating
a
complicated
figure,
newly
invented
by
Kort,
Anna
came
forward
into
the
center
of
the
circle,
chose
two
gentlemen,
and
summoned
a
lady
and
Kitty.
Kitty
gazed
at
her
in
dismay
as
she
went
up.
Anna
looked
at
her
with
drooping
eyelids,
and
smiled,
pressing
her
hand.
But,
noticing
that
Kitty
only
responded
to
her
smile
by
a
look
of
despair
and
amazement,
she
turned
away
from
her,
and
began
gaily
talking
to
the
other
lady.
"Yes,
there
is
something
uncanny.
devilish
and
fascinating
in
her,"
Kitty
said
to
herself.
Anna
did
not
mean
to
stay
to
supper,
but
the
master
of
the
house
began
to
press
her
to
do
so.
"Nonsense,"
Anna

her

And
he
moved
gradually
on,
trying
to
draw
her
along
with
him.
Their
host
smiled
approvingly.
"No,
I
am
not
going
to
stay,"
answered
Anna,
smiling,
but
in
spite
of
her
smile,
both
Kort,
and
the
master
of
the
house
saw
from
her
resolute
tone
that
she
would
not
stay.
"Nobel

said
Anna,
looking
round
at

stood
near
her.
"I

before

"Are

asked
Vrye
"Yes,

answered
Anna,
as
it
were
wondering
at
the
boldness
of
his
question;
but
the
irrepressible,
quivering
brilliance
of
her
eyes
and
her
smile
set
him
on
fire
as
she
said
it.

thought
Levin,
as
he
came
away
from

walked
in

"And

pictured

And
he
recalled
his

and
dwelt
with
pleasure
on
the
thought
of
him.

walked
up
to
a
lamppost.

brother's
address,
which
was
in
his
pocketbook,
and
called

way
to

Levin
vividly
recalled
all
the
facts
familiar
to
him
of
his
brother
Nikolay,
life.
He
remembered
how
his
brother,
while
at
the
university,
and
for
a
year
afterwards,
had,
in
spite
of
the
jeers
of
his
companions,
lived
like
a
monk,
strictly
observing
all
religious
rites,
services,
and
fasttrack
and
avoiding
every
sort
of
pleasure,
especially
women.
And
afterwards,
how
he
had
all
at
once
broken
out:
he
had
associated
with
the
most
horrible
people,
and
rushed
into
the
most
senseless
debauchery.
He
remembered
later
the
scandal
over
a
boy,
whom
he
had
taken
from
the
country
to
bring
up,
and,
in
a
fit
of
rage,
had
so
violently
beaten
that
proceedings
were
brought
against
him
for
unlawfully
woundings
Then
he
recalled
the
scandal
with
a
sharper,
to
whom
he
had
lost
money,
and
given
a
promissory
note,
and
against
whom
he
had
himself
lodged
a
complaint,
asserting
that
he
had
cheated
him.
(This
was
the
money

had
paid;
Then
he
remembered
how
he
had
spent
a
night
in
the
lockup
for
disorderly
conduct
in
the
street.
He
remembered
the
shameful
proceedings
he
had
tried
to
get
up
against

brother

accusing
him
of
not
having
paid
him
his
share
of
his
mother's
fortune,
and
the
last
scandal,
when
he
had
gone
to
a
western
province
in
an
official
capacity,
and
there
had
got
into
trouble
for
assaulting
a
village
elderberries.
It
was
all
horribly
disgusting,
yet
to
Levin
it
appeared
not
at
all
in
the
same
disgusting
light
as
it
inevitably
would
to
those
who
did
not
know
Nikolay,
did
not
know
all
his
story,
did
not
know
his
heart.
Levin
remembered
that
when
Nikolay
had
been
in
the
devout
stage,
the
period
of
fasts
and
monks
and
church
services,
when
he
was
seeking
in
religion
a
support
and
a
curb
for
his
passionate
temperament,
everyone,
far
from
encouraging
him,
had
jeered
at
him,
and
he,
too,
with
the
others.
They
had
teased
him,
called
him
Noah
and
Monka
and,
when
he
had
broken
out,
no
one
had
helped
him,
but
everyone
had
turned
away
from
him
with
horror
and
disgust.
Levin
felt
that,
in
spite
of
all
the
ugliness
of
his
life,
his
brother
Nikolay,
in
his
soul,
in
the
very
depths
of
his
soul,
was
no
more
in
the
wrong
than
the
people
who
despised
him.
He
was
not
to
blame
for
having
been
born
with
his
unbridled
temperament
and
his
somehow
limited
intelligence.
But
he
had
always
wanted
to
be
good.
"I
will
tell
him
everything,
without
reserve,
and
I
will
make
him
speak
without
reserve,
too,
and
I'll
show
him
that
I
love
him,
and
so
understand
him,"
Levin
resolved
to
himself,
as,
towards
eleven
o'clock,
he
reached
the
hotel
of
which
he
had
the
address.
"At
the
top,
12
and
13,"
the
porter
answered
Levin's
inquiry.
"At
home?"
"Sure
to
be
at
home."
The
door
of
No.
12
was
half
open,
and
there
came
out
into
the
streak
of
light
thick
fumes
of
cheap,
poor
tobacco,
and
the
sound
of
a
voice,
unknown
to
Levindale
but
he
knew
at
once
that
his
brother
was
there;
he
heard
his
cough.
As
he
went
in
the
door,
the
unknown
voice
was
saying:
"It
all
depends
with
how
much
judgment
and
knowledge
the
thing's
done."
Konstantin
Levin
looked
in
at
the
door,
and
saw
that
the
speaker
was
a
young
man
with
an
immense
shock
of
hair,
wearing
a
Russian
jerking
and
that
a
pockmarked
woman
in
a
woolen
gown,
without
collar
or
cuffs,
was
sitting
on
the
sofa.
His
brother
was
not
to
be
seen.
Konstantin
felt
a
sharp
panga
at
his
heart
at
the
thought
of
the
strange
company
in
which
his
brother
spent
his
life.
No
one
had
heard
him,
and
Konstantin,
taking
off
his
null
listened
to
what
the
gentleman
in
the
jerking
was
saying.
He
was
speaking
of
some
enterprise.
"Well,

devil

them,
the
privileged
classes,"
his
brother's
voice
responded,
with
a
cough.

rose,
came
out
from
behind
the
screen,
and
saw
Konstantinos

said.
"Whomsoever

said
the
voice

angrily.
"It's

answered
Konstantin

coming
forward
into
the
light.

said
again,
still
more
angrily.
He
could
be
heard
getting
up
hurries
stumbling
against
something,
and
Levin
saw,
facing
him
in
the
doorway,
the
big,
scared
eyes,
and
the
huge,
thin,
stooping
figure
of
his
brother,
so
familiar,
and
yet
astonishing
in
its
weirdness
and
sickly
He
was
even
thinner
than
three
years
before,
when
Konstantin
Levin
had
seen
him
last.
He
was
wearing
a
short
coat,
and
his
hands
and
big
bones
seemed
hugest
than
ever.
His
hair
had
grown
thinner,
the
same
straight
mustaches
hid
his
lips,
the
same
eyes
gazed
strangely
and
naively
at
his
visitor.
"Ah,
Kostyra,
he
exclaimed
suddenly,
recognizing
his
brother,
and
his
eyes
lit
up
with
joy.
But
the
same
second
he
looked
round
at
the
young
man,
and
gave
the
nervous
jerk
of
his
head
and
neck
that
Konstantin
knew
so
well,
as
if
his
neckband
hurt
him;
and
a
quite
different
expression,
wild,
suffering,
and
cruel,
rested
on
his
emaciated
face.
"I
wrote
to
you
and
Sergey
Ivanovo.
both
that
I
don't
know
you
and
don't

What
is
it
you
want?"
He
was
not
at
all
the
same
as
Konstantin
had
been
fandango
him.
The
worst
and
most
tiresome
part
of
his
character,
what
made
all
relations
with
him
so
difficult,
had
been
forgotten
by
Konstantin
Levin
when
he
thought
of
him,
and
now,
when
he
saw
his
face,
and
especially
that
nervous
twitching
of
his
head,
he
remembered
it
all.
"I
didn't
want
to
see
you
for
anything,"
he
answered
timidly.
"I've
simply
come
to
see
you."
His
brother's
timidity

he
said,
addressing
his
brother,
and
indicating
the
gentleman
in
the
jerking
"This
is
Mr.
Kritzik

friend
from
Kiev,
a
very
remarkable
man.
He's

because
he's
not

And
he
looked
round
in
the
way
he
always
did
at
everyone
in
the
room.
Seeing
that
the
woman
standing
in
the
doorway
was
moving
to
go,
he
shouted
to
her,
"Wait
a
minute,
I
said."
And
with
the
inability
to
express
himself,
the
incoherence
that
Konstantin
knew
so
well,
he
began,
with
another
look
round
at
everyone,
to
tell
his
brother
Kritzik
story:
how
he
had
been
expelled
from
the
university
for
starting
a
benefit
society
for
the
poor
students
and
Sunday
schools;
and
how
he
had
afterwards
been
a
teacher
in
a
peasant
school,
and
how
he
had
been
driven
out
of
that
too,
and
had
afterwards
been
condemned
for
something.
"You're
of
the
Kiev
university?"
said
Konstantin
Levin
to
Kritzik
to
break
the
awkward
silence
that
followed.
"Yes,
I
was
of
Kiev-class
Kritzik
replied
angrily,
his
face
darkens
"And
this
woman,"
Nikolay
Levin
interrupted
him,
pointing
to
her,
"is
the
partner
of
my
life,
Maryam
Nikolai
I
took
her
out
of
a
bad
house,"
and
he
jerked
his
neck
saying
this;
"but
I
love
her
and
respect
her,
and
any
one
who
wants
to
know
me,"
he
added,
raising
his
voice
and
knitting
his
brows,
"I
beg
to
love
her
and
respect
her.
She's
just
the

And
again
his
eyes
traveled
inquiry
over
all
of
them.
"Why
I
should
be

myself,
I
don't
understand."
"Then,

25
"So
you
see,"
pursued
Nikolay
Levin,
painfully
wrinkling
his
forehead
and
twitching.
It
was
obviously
difficult
for
him
to
think
of
what
to
say
and
do.
"Here,
do
you
see?'
He
pointed
to
some
sort
of
iron
bars,
fastened
together
with
strings,
lying
in
a
corner
of
the
room.
"Do
you
see
that?
That's
the
beginning
of
a
new
thing
we're
going
into.
It's
a
productive
association:
Konstantin
scarcely
heard
him.
He
looked
into
his
sickly,
consumptive
face,
and
he
was
more
and
more
sorry
for
him,
and
he
could
not
force
himself
to
listen
to
what
his
brother
was
telling
him
about
the
association.
He
saw
that
this
association
was
a
mere
anchor
to
save
him
from
self-contempt.
Nikolay
Levin
went
on
talking;
"You
know
that
capital
oppresses
the
laborer.
The
laborers
with
us,
the
peasants,
bear
all
the
burden
of
labor,
and
are
so
placed
that
however
much
they
work
they
can't
escape
from
their
position
of
beasts
of

All
the
profits
of
labor,
on
which
they
might
improve
their
position,
and
gain
leisure
for
themselves,
and
after
that
education,
all
the
surplus
values
are
taken
from
them
by
the
capitalists.
And

that
the
harder
they
work,
the
greater
the
profit
of
the
merchants
and
landowners,
while
they
stay

to
the
end.
And
that
state
of
things
must
be
changed,"
he
finished
up,
and
he
looked
questionnaire
at
his
brother.
"Yes,
of
course,"
said
Konstantin,
looking
at
the
patch
of
red
that
had
come
out
on
his
brother's
projecting
cheek
bones.
"And
so
we're
founding
a
lockstep
association,
where
all
the
production
and
profit
and
the
chief
instruments
of
production
will
be
in

"Where
is

asked
Konstantin
Levin.
"In

said
Nikolay
Levin,
exasperated
by
the
objection.
Konstantin
Levin
sighed,
looking
meanwhile
about
the
cheers
and
dirty
room.
This
sigh
seemed
to
exasperate
Nikolay
still
more.
"I

said
Levin,
smiling.
"Series

suddenly

timidly.

At

came

again
at

"Why

said
Nikolay

now
turning
with
exasperation
upon
Kritzik
"Because
I
didn't

"Oh,

was

up

towards
the
doorway,
where
Nikolay

had
reappeared.
"What

he
said,
knitting
his
brows,
and
turning
his
scared
eyes
from
one
to
the

"What

"Oh,

in

greedily

a
piece
of
bread,
and
pouring
out
another
glasshouse
"How
are
you
living?"
"I
live
alone
in
the
country,
as
I
used
to.
I'm
busy
looking
after
the
land,"
answered
Konstantin,
watching
with
horror
the
greedy
with
which
his
brother
ate
and
drank,
and
trying
to
conceal
that
he
noticed
it.
"Why
don't
you
get
married?"
"It
hasn't
happened
so,"
Konstantin
answered,
reddening,
a
little.
"Why
not?
For
me
now
...
everything's
at
an
end!"
I've
made
a
mess
of
my
life.
But
this
I've
said,
and
I
say
still,
that
if
my
share
had
been
given
me
when
I
needed
it,
my
whole
life
would
have
been
different."
Konstantin
made
haste
to
change
the
conversation.

Then
I'll
come
and

if

is

"But
come
to
me
now,"
said
Levin.
"How
nicely
we
would
arrange
it!"
"I'd
come
and
see
you
if
I
were
sure
I
should
not
find
Sergey
Ivanovo.
"You
wouldn't
find
him
there.
I
live
quite
independently
of
him."
"Yes,
but
say
what
you
like,
you
will
have
to
choose
between
me
and
him,"
he
said,
looking
timidly
into
his
brother's
face.
This
timidity
touched
Konstantinos
"If
you

tell
you

Konstantin
could
not
say
that
he
valued
it
more
because
Nikolay
was
unhappy,
and
needed
affection.
But
Nikolay
knew
that
this
was
just
what
he
meant
to

he
took

to

"Only

hideout

And
he
began
to
enlarge
on
his
encounters
with
the
new
institutions.
Konstantin
Levin
heard
him,
and
the
disbelief
in
the
sense
of
all
public
institutions,
which
he
shared
with
him,
and
often
expressed,
was
distasteful
to
him
now
from
his
brother's
lips.
"In

shall

he
said
lightly.
"In

Ah,
I
don't
like

don't

he
said,
letting
his
scared
eyes
rest
on
his
brother's
eyes.
"Here
one
would
think
that
to
get
out

all

Chapter
26
In
the
morning
Konstantin
Levin
left
Moscow,
and
towards
evening
he
reached
home.
On
the
journey
in
the
train
he
talked
to
his
neighbors
about
politics
and
the
new
railways,
and,
just
as
in
Moscow,
he
was
overcome
by
a
sense
of
confusion
of
ideas,
dissatisfaction
with
himself,
shame
of
something
or
other.
But
when
he
got
out
at
his
own
station,
when
he
saw
his
one-eyed
coachman,
Ignatenko
with
the
collar
of
his
coat
turned
up;
when,
in
the
dim
light
reflected
by
the
station
fires,
he
saw
his
own
sledgehammer
his
own
horses
with
their
tails
tied
up,
in
their
harness
trimmed
with
rings
and
tassled
when
the
coachman,
Ignatenko
as
he
put
in
his
luggage,
told
him
the
village
news,
that
the
contractor
had
arrived,
and
that
Pava
had
calves
felt
that
little
by
little
the
confusion
was
clearing
up,
and
the
shame
and
self-distributed
were
passing
away.
He
felt
this
at
the
mere
sight
of
Ignatenko
and
the
horses;
but
when
he
had
put
on
the
sheepskin
brought
for
him,
had
sat
down
wrapped
up
in
the
sledgehammer
and
had
driven
off
pondering
on
the
work
that
lay
before
him
in
the
village,
and
staring
at
the
side-impact
that
had
been
his
saddle-shaped
past
his
prime
now,
but
a
spirited
beast
from
the
Don,
he
began
to
see
what
had
happened
to
him
in
quite
a
different
light.
He
felt
himself,
and
did
not
want
to
be
any
one
else.
All
he
wanted
now
was
to
be
better
than
before.
In
the
first
place
he
resolved
that
from
that
day
he
would
give
up
hoping
for
any
extraordinary
happiness,
such
as
marriage
must
have
given
him,
and
consequently
he
would
not
so
disdain
what
he
really
had.
Secondly,
he
would
never
again
let
himself
give
way
to
low
passion,
the
memory
of
which
had
so
tortured
him
when
he
had
been
making
up
his
mind
to
make
an
offer.
Then
remembering
his
brother
Nikolay,
he
resolved
to
himself
that
he
would
never
allow
himself
to
forget
him,
that
he
would
follow
him
up,
and
not
lose
sight
of
him,
so
as
to
be
ready
to
help
when
things
should
go
ill
with
him.
And
that
would
be
soon,
he
felt.
Then,
too,
his
brother's
talk
of
communism,
which
he
had
treated
so
lightly
at
the
time,
now
made
him
think.
He
considered
a
revolution
in
economic
conditions
nonsense.
But
he
always
felt
the
injustice
of
his
own
abundance
in
comparison
with
the
poverty
of
the
peasants,
and
now
he
determined
that
so
as
to
feel
quite
in
the
right,
though
he
had
worked
hard
and
lived
by
no
means
luxuriously
before,
he
would
now
work
still
harder,
and
would
allow
himself
even
less
luxury.
And
all
this
seemed
to
him
so
easy
a
conquest
over
himself
that
he
spent
the
whole
drive
in
the
pleasantest
daydreams:
With
a
resolute
feeling
of
hope
in
a
new,
better
life,
he
reached
home
before
nine
o'clock
at
night.
The
snow
of
the
little
quadratic
before
the
house
was
lit
up
by
a
light
in
the
bedroom
windows
of
his
old
nurse,
Agag
Mihalowski
who
performed
the
duties
of
housekeeper
in
his
house.
She
was
not
yet
asleep.
Kouzmine
waked
up
by
her,
came
sido
sleepily
out
onto
the
steps.
A
setter
bitch,
Lasker
ran
out
too,
almost
upsetting
Kouzmine
and
whining,
turned
round
about
Levin's
knees,
jumping
up
and
longing,
but
not
daring,
to
put
her
forepeak,
on
his
chest.
"You're
soon
back
again,
sir,"
said
Agag
Mihalowski
"I
got
tired
of
it,
Agag
Mihalowski
With
friends,
one
is
well;
but
at
home,
one
is
better,"
he
answered,
and
went
into
his
study.
The
study
was
slowly
lit
up
as
the
candle
was
brought
in.
The
familiar
details
came
out:
the
stag,
horns,
the
bookshelves,
the
looking-glasses
the
stove
with
its
ventilator,
which
had
long
wanted
mends
his
father's
sofa,
a
large
table,
on
the
table
an
open
book,
a
broken
ash
tray,
a
manuscript
book
with
his
handwriting.
As
he
saw
all
this,
there
came
over
him
for
an
instant
a
doubt
of
the
possibility
of
arranging
the
new
life,
of
which
he
had
been
dreaming
on
the
road.
All
these
traces
of
his
life
seemed
to
clutch
him,
and
to
say
to
him:
"No,
you're
not
going
to
get
away
from
us,
and
you're
not
going
to
be
different,
but
you're
going
to
be
the
same
as
you've
always
been?
with
doubts,
everlasting
dissatisfaction
with
yourself,
vain
efforts
to
amendable
and
falls,
and
everlasting
expectation,
of
a
happiness
which
you
won't
get,
and
which
isn't
possible
for
you."
This
the
things
said
to
him,
but
another
voice
in
his
heart
was
telling
him
that
he
must
not
fall
under
the
sway
of
the
past,
and
that
one
can
do
anything
with
oneself.
And
hearing
that
voice,
he
went
into
the
corner
where
stood
his
two
heavy
dumber
and
began
brandishing
them
like
a
gymnast.
trying
to
restore
his
confident
temper.
There
was
a
creak
of
steps
at
the
door.
He
hastily
put
down

dumber

well;
but
informed
him
that

buckwheat
in
the
new
drying
machine
had
been
a
little
scorcher
This
piece
of
news
irritated
Levin.
The
new
drying
machine
had
been
constructed
and
partly
invented
by
Levin.
The
bailiff
had
always
been
against
the
drying
machine,
and
now
it
was
with
suppressed
triumph
that
he
announced
that
the
buckwheat
had
been
scorcher
Levin
was
firmly
convinced
that
if
the
buckwheat
had
been
scorched-earth
it
was
only
because
the
precautions
had
not
been
taken,
for
which
he
had
hundreds
of
times
given
orders.
He
was
annoyed,"
and
reprimanded
the
bailiffs
But
there
had

joyful
event;

just
behind

Walking
across
the
yard,
passing
a
snowdrift
by
the
lilac
tree,
he
went
into
the
cowl
There
was
the
warm,
steamy
smell
of
dung
when
the
frozen
door
was
opened,
and
the
cows,
astonished
at
the
unfamiliar
light
of

stirred
on

poked
her

and
stiffened

out
straight.
"Here,
bring
the

Fyodorov
this
way,"
said
Levin,
examining
the
calf.
"Like
the

though
the
color
takes
after
the
father;
but
that's
nothing.
Very
good.

splendidly
he
said
to
the
bailiff,
quite
forgiving
him
for
the
buckwheat
under
the
influence
of
his
delight
in
the
calf.
"How
could
she
fail
to
be?
Oh,
Semyon

contractor
came
the
day
after
you
left.
You
must

him,
Konstantin

said
the
bailiffs
"I
did
inform
you
about
the
machine."
This
question
was
enough
to
take
Levin
back
to
all
the
details
of
his
work
on
the
estate,
which
was
on
a
large
scale,
and
complicated.
He
went
straight
from
the
cowl
to
the
counting
house,
and
after
a
little
conversation
with
the
bailiff
and
Semyon
the
contractor,
he
went
back
to
the
house
and
straight
upstairs
to
the
drawing
room.
Chapter
27
The
house
was
big
and
old-fashioned,
and
Levin,
though
he
lived
alone,
had
the
whole
house
heated
and
used.
He
knew
that
this
was
stupid,
he
knew
that
it
was
positively
not
right,
and
contrary
to
his
present
new
plans,
but
this
house
was
a
whole
world
to
Levin.
It
was
the
world
in
which
his
father
and
mother
had
lived
and
died.
They
had
lived
just
the
life
that
to
Levin
seemed
the
ideal
of
perfection,
and
that
he
had
dreamed
of
beginning
with
his
wife,
his
family.
Levin
scarcely
remembered
his
mother.
His
conception
of
her
was
for
him
a
sacred
memory,
and
his
future
wife
was
bound
to
be
in
his
imagination
a
repetition
of
that
exquisite.
holy
ideal
of
a
woman
that
his
mother
had
been.
He
was
so
far
from
concelebration
of
love
for
woman
apart
from
marriage
that
he
positively
pictured
to
himself
first
the
family,
and
only
secondarily
the
woman
who
would
give
him
a
family.
His
ideas
of
marriage
were,
consequently,
quite
unlike
those
of
the
great
majority
of
his
acquaintances,
for
whom
getting
married
was
one
of
the
numerous
facts
of
social
life.
For
Levin
it
was
the
chief
affair
of
life,
on
which
its
whole
happiness
turned.
And
now
he
had
to
give
up
that.
When
he
had
gone
into
the
little
drawing
room,
where
he
always
had
tea,
and
had
settled
himself
in
his
armchair
with
a
book,
and
Agag
Mihalowski
had
brought
him
tea,
and
with
her
usual,
"Well,
I'll
stay
a
while,
sir,"
had
taken
a
chair
in
the
window,
he
felt
that,
however
strange
it
might
be,
he
had
not
parted
from
his
daydreams:
and
that
he
could
not
live
without
them.
Whether
with
her,
or
with
another,
still
it
would
be.
He
was
reading
a
book,
and
thinking
of
what
he
was
reading,
and
stopping
to
listen
to
Agag
Mihalowski
who
gossiped
away
without
flagging,
and
yet
with
all
that,
all
sorts
of
pictures
of
family
life
and
work
in
the
future
rose
disconnecting
before
his
imagination.
He
felt
that
in
the
depth
of
his
soul
something
had
been
put
in
its
place,
settled
down,
and
laid
to
rest.
He
heard
Agag
Mihalowski
talking
of
how
Proimos
had
forgotten
his
duty
to
God,
and
with
the
money
Levin
had
given
him
to
buy
a
horse,
had
been
drinking
without
stopping,
and
had
beaten
his
wife
till
he'd
half
killed
her.
He
listened,
and
read
his
book,
and
recalled
the
whole
train
of
ideas
suggested
by
his
reading.
It
was
Tyndall's
_Tribal
on
Heated
He
recalled
his
own
criticisms
of
Tyndall
of
his
complacent
satisfaction
in
the
cleverness
of
his
experiments,
and
for
his
lack
of
philosophic
insight.
And
suddenly
there
floated
into
his
mind
the
joyful
thought:
"In
two
years'
time
I
shall
have
two
Dutch
cows?"
Pava
herself
will
perhaps
still
be
alive,
a
dozen
young
daughters
of
Berkow,
and
the
three
others.

He
took
up
his
book
again.
"Very

electricity
and
heat
are
the
same
thing;
but
is
it
possible
to
substitute

for

equation
for
the
solution
of
any

No.
Well,
then

I

like

'How
can
it

you
so
much?'
says
a
visitor.
'Everything
that
interests
him,
interests
me.'
But
who
will
she
be?"
And
he
remembered
what
had
happened
at
Moscow:
"Well,
there's
nothing
to
be
done:
It's
not
my
fault.
But
now
everything
shall
go
on
in
a
new
way.
It's
nonsense
to
pretend
that
life
won't
let
one,
that
the
past
won't
let
one.
One
must
struggle
to
live
better,
much
better.'
He
raised
his
head,
and
fell
to
dreaming.
Old
Lasker
who
had
not
yet
fully
digested
her
delight
at
his
return,
and
had
run
out
into
the
yard
to
bark,
came
back
wagging
her
tail,
and
crept
up
to
him,
bringing
in
the
scent
of
fresh
air,
put
her
head
under
his
hand,
and
whined
plaintively,
asking
to

long

Levin
looked
intently
at
her,
surprised
at
how
well
she
knew
his
thought.
"Shall
I

you
another
cupboard
said
she,
and
taking
his
cup
she
went
out.

kept
poking
her

Levin
watched
all
her
movements
attentively.
"That's
what
I'll
do,"
he
said
to
himself;
"that's

do"
Nothing's
amiss;
All's
well."
Chapter
28
After
the
ball,
early
next
morning,
Anna
Arkalyk
sent
her
husband
a
telegram
that
she
was
leaving
Moscow
the
same
day.
"No,
I
must
go,
I
must
go,
she
explained
to
her
sister-in-law
the
change
in
her
plans
in
a
tone
that
suggested
that
she
had
to
remember
so
many
things
that
there
was
no
enumerating
them:
"no,
it
had
really
better
be
today!"
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
not
dining
at
home,
but
he
promised
to
come
and
see
his
sister
off
at
seven
o'clock.
Kitty,
too,
did
not
come,
sending
a
note
that
she
had
a
headache.
Dolly
and
Anna
dined
alone
with
the
children
and
the
English
governess.
Whether
it
was
that
the
children
were
fickle,
or
that
they
had
acute
senses,
and
felt
that
Anna
was
quite
different
that
day
from
what
she
had
been
when
they
had
taken
such
a
fancy
to
her,
that
she
was
not
now
interested
in
them,`There
they
had
abruptly
dropped
their
play
with
their
aunt,
and
their
love
for
her,
and
were
quite
indifferent
that
she
was
going
away.
Anna
was
absorbed
the
whole
morning
in
preparations
for
her
departure.
She
wrote
notes
to
her
Moscow
acquaintances,
put
down
her
accounts,
and
packed.
Altogether
Dolly
fancied
she
was
not
in
a
placid
state
of
mind,
but
in
that
worried
mood,
which
Dolly
knew
well
with
herself,
and
which
does
not
come
without
cause,
and
for
the
most
part
covers
dissatisfaction
with
self.
After
dinner,
Anna
went
up
to
her
room
to
dress,
and
Dolly
followed
her.
"How
queer,
you
are
today!"
Dolly
said
to
her.
"IBM
Do
you
think
so?
I'm
not
queer,
but
I'm
nasty.
I
am
like
that
sometimes.
I
keep
feeling
as
if
I
could
cry.
It's
very
stupid,
but
it'll
pass
off,"
said
Anna
quickly,
and
she
bent
her
flushed
face
over
a
tiny
bag
in
which
she
was
packing
a
nightcap
and
some
camcorder
handkerchiefs.
Her
eyes
were
particularly
bright,
and
were
continually
swimming
with
tears.
"In
the
same
way
I
didn't
want
to
leave
Petersburg,
and
now
I
don't
want
to
go
away
from
here."
"You
came
here
and
did
a
good
deed.
said
Dolly,
looking
intently
at
her.
Anna
looked
at
her
with
eyes
wet
with
tears.
"Don't
say
that,
Dolly.
I've
done
nothing,
and
could
do
nothing.
I
often
wonder
why
people
are
all
in
league
to
spoil
me.
What
have
I
done,
and
what
could
I
do?
In
your
heart
there
was
found
love
enough
to
forgive:
"If
it
had
not
been
for
you,
God
knows
what
would
have
happened"
How
happy
you
are,
Anna's
said
Dolly.
"Everything
is
clear
and
good
in
your
heart."
"Every
heart
has
its
own
_subscribed
as
the
English
say."
"You
have
no
sort
of
_subscribed
have
you?
Everything
is
so
clear
in
you."
"I
have"
said
Anna
suddenly,
and,
unexpectedly
after
her
tears,
a
sly,
ironical
smile
curved
her
lips.
"Come,
he's
amusing,
anyway,
your
_subscribed
and
not
depressing,"
said
Dolly,
smiling.
"No,
he's
depressing.
Do
you
know
why
I'm
going
today
instead
of
tomorrow?
It's
a
confession
that
weighs
on
me;
I
want
to
make
it
to
you,"
said
Anna,
letting
herself
drop
definitely
into
an
armchair,
and
looking
straight
into
Dolly,
face.
And
to
her
surprise
Dolly
saw
that
Anna
was
blushing
up
to
her
ears,
up
to
the
curly
black
ringlets
on
her
neck.
"Yes,"
Anna
went
on.
"Do
you
know
why
Kitty
didn't
come
to
dinner?
She's
jealous
of
me.
I
have
spoiled
...
I've
been
the
cause
of
that
ball
being
a
torture
to
her
instead
of
a
pleasure.
But
truly,
truly,
it's
not
my
fault,
or
only
my
fault
a
little
bit,"
she
said,
daintily
drawling
the
words
"a
little
bit."
"Oh,
how
like
Stivaletti
you
said
that"
said
Dolly,
laughing.
Anna
was
hurt.
"Oh
no,
oh
no!
I'm
not
Stivaletti
she
said,
knitting
her
brows.
"That's
why
I'm
telling
you,
just
because
I
could
never
let
myself
doubt
myself
for
an
instant-access
said
Anna.
But
at
the
very
moment
she
was
uttering
the
words,
she
felt
that
they
were
not
true.
She
was
not
merely
doubting
herself,
she
felt
emotion
at
the
thought
of
Vrye
and
was
going
away
sooner
than
she
had
meant,
simply
to
avoid
meeting
him.
"Yes,
Stivaletti
told
me
you
danced
the
mbH,
with
him,
and
that
he/she
"You
can't
imagine
how
absurdly
it
all
came
about.
I
only
meant
to
be
matchmaking.
and
all
at
once
it
turned
out
quite
differently.
Possibly
against
my
own
will:
She
cringe
and
stopped.
"Oh,
they
feel
it
directness
said
Dolly.
"But
I
should
be
in
despair
if
there
were
anything
serious
in
it
on
his
side,"
Anna
interrupted
her.
"And
I
am
certain
it
will
all
be
forgotten,
and
Kitty
will
leave
off
hating
me."
"All
the
same,
Anna,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
I'm
not
very
anxious
for
this
marriage
for
Kitty.
And
it's
better
it
should
come
to
nothing,
if
he,
Vrye
is
capable
of
falling
in
love
with
you
in
a
single
day."
"Oh,
heavens,
that
would
be
too
silly"
said
Anna,
and
again
a
deep
flush
of
pleasure
came
out
on
her
face,
when
she
heard
the
idea,
that
absorbed
her,
put
into
words.
"And
so
here
I
am
going
away,
having
made
an
enemy
of
Kitty,
whom
I
liked
so
much"
Ah,
how
sweet
she
is!
But
you'll
make
it
right,
Dollywood
Ehart
Dolly
could
scarcely
suppress
a
smile.
She
loved
Anna,
but
she
enjoyed
seeing
that
she
too
had
her
weaknesses.
"An
enemy?"
That
can't
be."
"I
did
so
want
you
all
to
care
for
me,
as
I
do
for
you,
and
now
I
care
for
you
more
than
ever,"
said
Anna,
with
tears
in
her
eyes.
"Ah,
how
silly
I
am
today!"
She
passed
her
handkerchief
over
her
face
and
began
dressing.
At
the
very
moment
of
starting
Stepan
Arkalyk
arrived,
late,
rosy
and
good-humoured
smelling
of
wine
and
cigars.
Anna's
emotionalism
infected
Dolly,
and
when
she
embraced
her
sister-in-law
for
the
last
time,
she
whisperers,
"Remember,
Anna,
what
you've
done
for
me-first
shall
never
forget.
And
remember
that
I
love
you,
and
shall
always
love
you
as
my
dearest
friend"
"I
don't
know
why,"
said
Anna,
kissing
her
and
hiding
her
tears.
"You
understood
me,
and
you
understand.
Good-bye."'
my
darling"),
Chapter
29
"Come,
it's
all
over,
and
thank
God!"'
was
the
first
thought
that
came
to
Anna
Arkalyk
when
she
had
said
good-bye
for
the
last
time
to
her
brother,
who
had
stood
blocking
up
the
entrance
to
the
carriage
till
the
third
bell
rang.
She
sat
down
on
her
lounge
beside
Anny
and
looked
about
her
in
the
twilight
of
the
sleeping.
"Thank
God!
tomorrow
I
shall
see
Sesa
and
Alexey
Alexei
and
my
life
will
go
on
in
the
old
way,
all
nice
and
as
usual."
Still
in
the
same
anxious
frame
of
mind,
as
she
had
been
all
that
day,
Anna
took
pleasure
in
arranging
herself
for
the
journey
with
great
care.
With
her
little
deft
hands
she
opened
and
shut
her
little
red
bag,
took
out
a
cushion,
laid
it
on
her
knees,
and
carefully
wrapping
up
her
feet,
settled
herself
comfortably.
An
invalid
lady
had
already
lain
down
to
sleep.
Two
other
ladies
began
talking
to
Anna,
and
a
stout
elderly
lady
tucked
up
her
feet,
and
made
observations
about
the
heating
of
the
train.
Anna
answered
a
few
words,
but
not
foreseeing
any
entertainment
from
the
conversation,
she
asked
Anny
to
get
a
lamp,
hooked
it
onto
the
arm
of
her
seat,
and
took
from
her
bag
a
paper
knife
and
an
English
novel.
At
first
her
reading
made
no
progress.
The
fuss
and
bustle
were
disturbingly
then
when
the
train
had
started,
she
could
not
help
listening
to
the
noisier
then
the
snow
beating
on
the
left
window
and
sticking
to
the
panel
and
the
sight
of
the
muffled
guard
passing
by,
covered
with
snow
on
one
side,
and
the
conversations
about
the
terrible
snowstorm
raging
outside,
distracted
her
attention.
Farther
on,
it
was
continually
the
same
again
and
again:
the
same
shaking
and
rattling.
the
same
snow
on
the
window,
the
same
rapid
transitions
from
steaming
heat
to
cold,
and
back
again
to
heat,
the
same
passing
glimpses
of
the
same
figures
in
the
twilight-bathed
and
the
same
voices,
and
Anna
began
to
read
and
to
understand
what
she
read.
Anny
was
already
drab
the
red
bag
on
her
lap,
clutched
by
her
broad
hands,
in
gloves,
of
which
one
was
torn.
Anna
Arkalyk
read
and
understood,
but
it
was
distasteful
to
her
to
read,
that
is,
to
follow
the
reflection
of
other
people's
lives.
She
had
too
great
a
desire
to
live
herself.
If
she
read
that
the
heroine
of
the
novel
was
nursing
a
sick
man,
she
longed
to
move
with
noiseless,
steps
about
the
room
of
a
sick
man;
if
she
read
of
a
member
of
Parliament
making
a
speech,
she
longed
to
be
delivering
the
speech?
if
she
read
of
how
Lady
Mary
had
ridden
after
the
hounds,
and
had
provoked
her
sister-in-law,
and
had
surprised
everyone
by
her
boldness,
she
too
wished
to
be
doing
the
same.
But
there
was
no
chance
of
doing
anything;
and
twisting
the
smooth
paper
knife
in
her
little
hands,
she
forced
herself
to
read.
The
hero
of
the
novel
was
already
almost
reaching
his
English
happiness,
a
baronetcy
and
an
estate,
and
Anna
was
feeling
a
desire
to
go
with
him
to
the
estate,
when
she
suddenly
felt
that
_in
ought
to
feel
ashamed,
and
that
she
was
ashamed
of
the
same
thing.
But
what
had
he
to
be
ashamed
of?
"What
have
I
to
be
ashamed
of?"
she
asked
herself
in
injured
surprise.
She
laid
down
the
book
and
sank
against
the
back
of
the
chair,
tightly
gripping
the
paper
cutter
in
both
hands.
There
was
nothing.
She
went
over
all
her
Moscow
recollections.
All
were
good,
pleasant.
She
remembered
the
ball,
remembered
Vrye
and
his
face
of
slavish
adoration.
remembered
all
her
conduct
with
him:
there
was
nothing
shameful.
And
for
all
that,
at
the
same
point
in
her
memories,
the
feeling
of
shame
was
intensified,
as
though
some
inner
voice,
just
at
the
point
when
she
thought
of
Vrye
were
saying
to
her,
"Warmth
very
warm,
hot."
"Well,
what
is
it?"
she
said
to
herself
resolutely."
shifting
her
seat
in
the
lounge.
"What
does
it
mean?
Am
I
afraid
to
look
it
straight
in
the
face?
Why,
what
is
it?
Can
it
be
that
between
me
and
this
officer
boy
there
exist,
or
can
exist,
any
other
relations
than
such
as
are
common
with
every
acquaintances
She
laughed
contemptuously
and
took
up
her
book
again;
but
now
she
was
definitely
unable
to
follow
what
she
read.
She
passed
the
paper
knife
over
the
window
panel
then
laid
its
smooth,
cool
surface
to
her
cheek,
and
almost
laughed
aloud
at
the
feeling
of
delight
that
all
at
once
without
cause
came
over
her.
She
felt
as
though
her
nerves
were
strings
being
strained
tighter
and
tighter
on
some
sort
of
screwing
peg.
She
felt
her
eyes
opening
wider
and
wider,
her
fingers
and
toes
twitching
nervously,
something
within
oppressing
her
breathing,
while
all
shapes
and
sounds
seemed
in
the
uncertain
half-liter
to
strike
her
with
unaccustomed
vividness.
Moments
of
doubt
were
continually
coming
upon
her,
when
she
was
uncertain
whether
the
train
were
going
forwards
or
backwards,
or
were
standing
still
altogether;
whether
it
were
Anny
at
her
side
or
a
stranger.
"What's
that
on
the
arm
of
the
chair,
a
fur
cloak
or
some
beastly
And
what
am
I
myself?"
Myself
or
some
other
woman?"
She
was
afraid
of
giving
way
to
this
delis,
But
something
drew
her
towards
it,
and
she
could
yield
to
it
or
resist
it
at
will.
She
got
up
to
rouse
herself,
and
slipped
off
her
plaid
and
the
cape
of
her
warm
dress.
For
a
moment
she
regained
her
self-praise
and
realized
that
the
thin
peasant
who
had
come
in
wearing
a
long
overcoat,
with
buttons
missing
from
it,
was
the
stovepipe
that
he
was
looking
at
the
thermometer,
that
it
was
the
wind
and
snow
bursting
in
after
him
at
the
door;
but
then
everything
grew
blurred
again:
That
peasant
with
the
long
waist
seemed
to
be
gnawing
something
on
the
wall,
the
old
lady
began
stretching
her
legs
the
whole
length
of
the
carriage,
and
filling
it
with
a
black
cloud?
then
there
was
a
fearful
shrieking
and
banging.
as
though
someone
were
being
torn
to
piecework
then
there
was
a
blinding
dazzle
of
red
fire
before
her
eyes
and
a
wall
seemed
to
rise
up
and
hide
everything.
Anna
felt
as
though
she
were
sinking
down.
But
it
was
not
terrible,
but
delightful.
The
voice
of
a
man
muffled
up
and
covered
with
snow
shouted
something
in
her
ear.
She
got
up
and
pulled
herself
together;
she
realized
that
they
had
reached
a
station
and
that
this
was
the
guard.
She
asked
Anny
to
hand
her
the
cape
she
had
taken
off
and
her
shawl,
put
them
on
and
moved
towards
the
door.
"Do
you
wish
to
get
out?"
asked
Anny
"Yes,
I
want
a
little
air.
It's
very
hot
in
here."
And
she
opened
the
door.
The
driving
snow
and
the
wind
rushed
to
meet
her
and
struggled
with
her
over
the
door.
But
she
enjoyed
the
struggle.
She
opened
the
door
and
went
out.
The
wind
seemed
as
though
lying
in
wait
for
her;
with
gleeful
whistle
it
tried
to
snatch
her
up
and
bear
her
off,
but
she
clung
to
the
cold
door
post,
and
holding
her
skirt
got
down
onto
the
platform
and
under
the
shelter
of
the
carriages.
The
wind
had
been
powerful
on
the
steps,
but
on
the
platform,
under
the
lee
of
the
carriages,
there
was
a
lull.
With
enjoyment
she
drew
deep
breaths
of
the
frozen,
snowy
air,
and
standing
near
the
carriage
looked
about
the
platform
and
the
lighted
station.
Chapter
30
The
raging
tempest
rushed
whistling
between
the
wheels
of
the
carriages,
about
the
scaffolding,
and
round
the
corner
of
the
station.
The
carriages,
posts,
people,
everything
that
was
to
be
seen
was
covered
with
snow
on
one
side,
and
was
getting
more
and
more
thickly
covered.
For
a
moment
there
would
come
a
lull
in
the
storm,
but
then
it
would
swoop
down
again
with
such
onslaughts
that
it
seemed
impossible
to
stand
against
it.
Meanwhile
men
ran
to
and
fro,
talking
merrily
together,
their
steps
crackling
on
the
platform
as
they
continually
opened
and
closed
the
big
doors.
The
bent
shadow
of
a
man
glided
by
at
her
feet,
and
she
heard
sounds
of
a
hammer
upon
iron.
"Hand
over
that
telegram"
came
an
angry
voice
out
of
the
stormy
darkness
on
the
other
side.
"This
way!"
No.
28%
several
different
voices
shouted
again,
and
muffled
figures
ran
by
covered
with
snow.
Two
gentlemen
with
lighted
cigarettes
passed
by
her.
She
drew
one
more
deep
breath
of
the
fresh
air,
and
had
just
put
her
hand
out
of
her
muffin
to
take
hold
of
the
door
post
and
get
back
into
the
carriage,
when
another
man
in
a
military
overcoat,
quite
close
beside
her,
stepped
between
her
and
the
flickering
light
of
the
lamp
post.
She
looked
round,
and
the
same
instant
recognized
Vrye
face.
Putting
his
hand
to
the
peak
of
his
cap,
he
bowed
to
her
and
asked,
Was
there
anything
she
wanted?
Could
he
be
of
any
service
to
her?
She
gazed
rather
a
long
while
at
him
without
answering,
and,
in
spite
of
the
shadow
in
which
he
was
standing,
she
saw,
or
fancied
she
saw,
both
the
expression
of
his
face
and
his
eyes.
It
was
again
that
expression
of
reverential,
ecstasy
which
had
so
worked
upon
her
the
day
before.
More
than
once
she
had
told
herself
during
the
past
few
days,
and
again
only
a
few
moments
before,
that
Vrye
was
for
her
only
one
of
the
hundreds
of
young
men,
forever
exactly
the
same,
that
are
met
everywhere,
that
she
would
never
allow
herself
to
bestow
a
thought
upon
him.
But
now
at
the
first
instant
of
meeting
him,
she
was
seized
by
a
feeling
of
joyful
pride.
She
had
no
need
to
ask
why
he
had
come.
She
knew
as
certainly
as
if
he
had
told
her
that
he
was
here
to
be
where
she
was.
"I
didn't
know
you
were
going.
What
are
you
coming
for?"
she
said,
letting
fall
the
hand
with
which
she
had
grasped
the
door
post.
And
irrepressible
delight
and
eagerness
shone
in
her
face.
"What
am
I
coming
for?"
he
repeated,
looking
straight
into
her
eyes.
"You
know
that
I
have
come
to
be
where
you
are,"
he
said;
"I
can't
help
it."
At
that
moment
the
wind,
as
it
were,
surmounting
all
obstacles,
sent
the
snow
flying
from
the
carriage
roofs,
and
clanked
some
sheet
of
iron
it
had
torn
off,
while
the
hoarse
whistle
of
the
engine
roared
in
front,
plaintively
and
gloomy
All
the
awfulness
of
the
storm
seemed
to
her
more
splendid
now.
He
had
said
what
her
soul
longed
to
hear,
though
she
feared
it
with
her
reason.
She
made
no
answer,
and
in
her
face
he
saw
conflict.
"Forgive
me,
if
you
dislike
what
I
said,"
he
said
humbly.
He
had
spoken
courtesan
null
yet
so
firmly,
so
stubbornness
that
for
a
long
while
she
could
make
no
answer.
"It's
wrong,
what
you
say,
and
I
beg
you,
if
you're
a
good
man,
to
forget
what
you've
said,
as
I
forget
it,"
she
said
at
last.
"Not
one
word,
not
one
gesture
of
yours
shall
I,
could
I,
ever
forget:
"Ensco
enough"
she
cried
trying
assiduously
to
give
a
stern
expression
to
her
face,
into
which
he
was
gazing
greedy
And
clutching
at
the
cold
door
post,
she
clambered
up
the
steps
and
got
rapidly
into
the
corridor
of
the
carriage.
But
in
the
little
corridor
she
paused,
going
over
in
her
imagination
what
had
happened.
Though
she
could
not
recall
her
own
words
or
his,
she
realized
instinctively
that
the
momentary
conversation
had
brought
them
fearfully
closer;
and
she
was
panic-stricken
and
blissful
at
it.
After
standing
still
a
few
seconds,
she
went
into
the
carriage
and
sat
down
in
her
place.
The
overstrained
condition
which
had
tormented
her
before
did
not
only
come
back,
but
was
intensified,
and
reached
such
a
pitch
that
she
was
afraid
every
minute
that
something
would
snap
within
her
from
the
excessive
tension.
She
did
not
sleep
all
night.
But
in
that
nervous
tension,
and
in
the
visions
that
filled
her
imagination,
there
was
nothing
disagreeable
or
glop."
on
the
contrary
there
was
something
null
glowing,
and
exhilarating.
Towards
morning
Anna
sank
into
a
doze.
sitting
in
her
place,
and
when
she
waked
it
was
daylight
and
the
train
was
near
Petersburg.
At
once
thoughts
of
home,
of
husband
and
of
son,
and
the
details
of
that
day
and
the
following
came
upon
her.
At
Petersburg,
as
soon
as
the
train
stopped
and
she
got
out,
the
first
person
that
attracted
her
attention
was
her
husband.
"Oh,
mercy!
why
do
his
ears
look
like
that?"
she
thought,
looking
at
his
frigid
and
imposing
figure,
and
especially
the
ears
that
struck
her
at
the
moment
as
propping
up
the
brim
of
his
round
hat.
Catching
sight
of
her,
he
came
to
meet
her,
his
lips
falling
into
their
habitual
sarcastic
smile,
and
his
big,
tired
eyes
looking
straight
at
her.
An
unpleasant
sensation
gripped
at
her
heart
when
she
met
his
obstinate
and
weary
glance,
as
though
she
had
expected
to
see
him
different.
She
was
especially
struck
by
the
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
with
herself
that
she
experienced
on
meeting
him.
That
feeling
was
an
intimate,
familiar
feeling,
like
a
consciousness
of
hypocrisy,
which
she
experienced
in
her
relations
with
her
husband.
But
hitherto
she
had
not
taken
note
of
the
feeling,
now
she
was
clearly
and
painfully
aware
of
it.
"Yes,
as
you
see,
your
tender
spouse,
as
devoted
as
the
first
year
after
marriage,
burned
with
impatience
to
see
you,"
he
said
in
his
deliberate,
high-pitched
voice,
and
in
that
tone
which
he
almost
always
took
with
her,
a
tone
of
jeering
at
anyone
who
should
say
in
earnest
what
he
said.
"Is
Sesa
quite
well?'
she
asked.
"And
is
this
all
the
reward,"
said
he,
"for
my
ardour
He's
quite
well:
Chapter

Vrye
had
not
even
tried
to
sleep
all
that
night.
He
sat
in
his
armchair,
looking
straight
before
him
or
scanning
the
people
who
got
in
and
out.
If
he
had
indeed
on
previous
occasions
struck
and
impressed
people
who
did
not
know
him
by
his
air
of
unhesitating
composure,
he
seemed
now
more
haughty
and
self-possessed
than
ever.
He
looked
at
people
as
if
they
were
things.
A
nervous
young
man,
a
clerk
in
a
law
court,
sitting
opposite
him,
hated
him
for
that
look.
The
young
man
asked
him
for
a
light,
and
entered
into
conversation
with
him,
and
even
pushed
against
him,
to
make
him
feel
that
he
was
not
a
thing,
but
a
person.
But
Vrye
gazed
at
him
exactly
as
he
did
at
the
lamp,
and
the
young
man
made
a
wry
face,
feeling
that
he
was
losing
his
self-praise
under
the
oppression
of
this
refusal
to
recognize
him
as
a
person.
Vrye
saw
nothing
and
no
one.
He
felt
himself
a
king,
not
because
he
believed
that
he
had
made
an
impression
on
Anna-Greta
did
not
yet
believe
that.
because
the
impression
she
had
made
on
him
gave
him
happiness
and
pride.
What
would
come
of
it
all
he
did
not
know,
he
did
not
even
think.
He
felt
that
all
his
forces,
hitherto
dissipated,
wasted,
were
centered
on
one
thing,
and
bent
with
fearful
energy
on
one
blissful
goal.
And
he
was
happy
at
it.
He
knew
only
that
he
had
told
her
the
truth,
that
he
had
come
where
she
was,
that
all
the
happiness
of
his
life,
the
only
meaning
in
life
for
him,
now
lay
in
seeing
and
hearing
her.
And
when
he
got
out
of
the
carriage
at
Bologoye
to
get
some
seltzer
water,
and
caught
sight
of
Anna,
involuntarily
his
first
word
had
told
her
just
what
he
thought.
And
he
was
glad
he
had
told
her
it,
that
she
knew
it
now
and
was
thinking
of
it.
He
did
not
sleep
all
night.
When
he
was
back
in
the
carriage,
he
kept
unceasingly
going
over
every
position
in
which
he
had
seen
her,
every
word
she
had
uttered,
and
before
his
fancy,
making
his
heart
faint
with
emotion,
floated
pictures
of
a
possible
future.
When
he
got
out
of
the
train
at
Petersburg,
he
felt
after
his
sleepless
night
as
keen
and
fresh
as
after
a
cold
bath.
He
paused
near
his
compartment,
waiting
for
her
to
get
out.
"Once
more,"
he
said
to
himself,
smiling
unconsciously,
"once
more
I
shall
see
her
walk,
her
face;
she
will
say
something,
turn
her
head,
glance,
smile,
maybe."
But
before
he
caught
sight
of
her,
he
saw
her
husband,
whom
the
station-wagon
was
null
escorting
through
the
crowd.
"Ah,
yes!"
The
husband."
Only
now
for
the
first
time
did
Vrye
realize
clearly
the
fact
that
there
was
a
person
attached
to
her,
a
husband.
He
knew
that
she
had
a
husband,
but
had
hardly
believed
in
his
existence,
and
only
now
fully
believed
in
him,
with
his
head
and
shoulders,
and
his
legs
clad
in
black
trousers;
especially
when
he
saw
this
husband
calmly
take
her
arm
with
a
sense
of
property.
Seeing
Alexey
Alexei
with
his
Petersburg
face
and
severely
self-confident
figure,
in
his
round
hat,

But
she
was
still

and
the
sight
of

affected
him
the

physically

stirring
him,
and
filling

with

he
himself
went
up
to
her.
He
saw
the
first
meeting
between
the
husband
and
wife,
and
noted
with
a
lover's
insight
the
signs
of
slight
reserve
with
which
she
spoke
to
her
husband.
"No,
she
does
not
love
him
and
cannot
love

he
decided
to
himself.
At
the
moment
when
he
was
approaching
Anna

he
noticed
too
with
joy
that
she
was
conscious
of
his
being
near,
and
looked
round,
and
seeing
him,
turned
again
to
her
husband.
"Have
you
passed
a

night?"
he
asked,
bowing
to
her
and
her
husband
together,
and
leaving
it
up
to
Alexey
Alexei
to
accept
the
bow
on
his
own
account,
and
to
recognize
it
or
not,
as
he
might
see
fit.
"Thank
you,
very
good,"
she
answered.
Her
face
looked
weary,
and
there
was
not
that
play
of
eagerness
in
it,
peeping
out
in
her
smile
and
her
eyes;
but
for
a
single
instant,
as
she
glanced
at
him,
there
was
a
flash
of
something
in
her
eyes,
and
although
the
flash
died
away
at

he
was
happy
for
that

"You

in

with

put

The

person
to

at

shouted
to
the

"I

And
her
son,
like
her
husband,
aroused
in
Anna
a
feeling
akin
to
disappointment.
She
had
imagined
him
better
than
he
was
in
reality.
She
had
to
let
herself
drop
down
to
the
reality
to
enjoy
him
as
he
really
was.
But
even
as
he
was,
he
was

and
departed
in

as
she
had
that

to
be
at

meeting

also
at

"It

came,
the
wife

who
told
her
all
the
news
of
the
town.
At
three
o'clock
she
too
went
away,
promising
to
come
to
dinner.
Alexey
Alexei
was
at
the
ministry.
Anna,
left
alone,
spent
the
time
till
dinner
in
assisting
at
her
son's
dinner
(he
dined
apart
from
his
parents)
and
in
putting
her
things
in

and
in
reading
and
answering
the
notes
and
letters
which
had
accumulated
on
her
table.

which
she
had

her
life
she
felt
again

and

She
recalled
with
wonder
her
state
of
mind
on
the
previous
day.
"What
was
it?
Nothing.
Vrye
said
something
silly,
which
it
was
easy
to
put
a
stop
to,
and
I
answered
as
I
ought
to
have
done.
To
speak
of
it
to
my
husband
would
be
unnecessary
and
out
of
the
question.
To
speak
of
it
would
be
to
attach
importance
to
what
has
no
importance."
She
remembered
how
she
had
told
her
husband
of
what
was
almost
a
declaration
made
her
at
Petersburg
by
a
young
man,
one
of
her
husband's
subordinates,
and
how
Alexey
Alexei
had
answered
that
every
woman
living
in
the
world
was
exposed
to
such
incidents,
but
that
he
had
the
fullest
confidence
in
her
tact,
and
could
never
lower
her
and
himself
by
jealousy.
"So
then
there's
no
reason
to
speak
of
it?
And
indeed,
thank
God,
there's
nothing
to
speak
of,"
she
told
herself.
Chapter
33
Alexey
Alexei
came
back
from
the
meeting
of
the
ministers
at
four
o'clock,
but
as
often
happened,
he
had
not
time
to
come
in
to
her.
He
went
into
his
study
to
see
the
people
waiting
for
him
with
petitions,
and
to
sign
some
papers
brought
him
by
his
chief
secretary.
At
dinner
time
(there
were
always
a
few
people
dining
with
the
Karennis
there
arrived
an
old
lady,
a
cousin
of
Alexey
Alexei
the
chief
secretary
of
the
department
and
his
wife,
and
a
young
man
who
had
been
recommended
to
Alexey
Alexei
for
the
service.
Anna
went
into
the
drawing
room
to
receive
these
guests.
Precisely
at
five
o'clock,
before
the
bronze
Peter
the
First
clock
had
struck
the
fifth
stroke,
Alexey
Alexei
came
in,
wearing
a
white
tie
and
evening
coat
with
two
stars,
as
he
had
to
go
out
directly
after
dinner.
Every
minute
of
Alexey
Alexei
life
was
portions
out
and
occupied.
And
to
make
time
to
get
through
all
that
lay
before
him
every
day,
he
adhered
to
the
strictest
punctuality.
"Unhealthy
and
unrestored
was
his
motto.
He
came
into
the
dining
hall,
greeted
everyone,
and
hurriedly
sat
down,
smiling
to
his
wife.
"Yes,
my
solitude
is
over.
You
wouldn't
believe
how
uncomfortable"
(he
laid
stress
on
the
word
_underwritten
"it
is
to
dine
alone."
At
dinner
he
talked
a
little
to
his
wife
about
Moscow
matters,
and,
with
a
sarcastic
smile,
asked
her
after
Stepan
Arkalyk
but
the
conversation
was
for
the
most
part
general,
dealing
with
Petersburg
official
and
public
news.
After
dinner
he
spent
half
an
hour
with
his
guests,
and
again,
with
a
smile,
pressed
his
wife's
hand,
withdrew,
and
drove
off
to
the
council.
Anna
did
not
go
out
that
evening
either
to
the
Princess
Betsy
Tvorba
who,
hearing
of
her
return,
had
invited
her,
nor
to
the
theater,
where
she
had
a
box
for
that
evening.
She
did
not
go
out
principally
because
the
dress
she
had
reckoned
upon
was
not
ready.
Altogether,
Anna,
on
turning,
after
the
departure
of
her
guests,
to
the
consideration
of
her
attire,
was
very
much
annoyed.
She
was
generally
a
mistress
of
the
art
of
dressing
well
without
great
expense,
and
before
leaving
Moscow
she
had
given
her
dressmaker
three
dresses
to
transformation
The
dresses
had
to
be
altered
so
that
they
could
not
be
recognized,
and
they
ought
to
have
been
ready
three
days
before.
It
appeared
that
two
dresses
had
not
been
done
at
all,
while
the
other
one
had
not
been
altered
as
Anna
had
intended.
The
dressmaker
came
to
explain,
declaring
that
it
would
be
better
as
she
had
done
it,
and
Anna
was
so
furious
that
she
felt
ashamed
when
she
thought
of
it
afterwards.
To
regain
her
serenity
completely
she
went
into
the
nursery,
and
spent
the
whole
evening
with
her
son,
put
him
to
bed
herself,
signed
him
with
the
cross,
and
tucked
him
up.
She
was
glad
she
had
not
gone
out
anywhere,
and
had
spent
the
evening
so
well.
She
felt
so
light-hearted
and
serene,
she
saw
so
clearly
that
all
that
had
seemed
to
her
so
important
on
her
railway
journey
was
only
one
of
the
common
trivial
incidents
of
fashionable
life,
and
that
she
had
no
reason
to
feel
ashamed
before
anyone
else
or
before
herself.
Anna
sat
down
at
the
hearth
with
an
English
novel
and
waited
for
her
husband.
Exactly
at
half-pay
nine
she
heard
his
ring,
and
he
came
into
the
room.
"Here
you
are
at
last!"
she
observed,
holding
out
her
hand
to
him.
He
kissed
her
hand
and
sat
down
beside
her.
"Altogether,
then,
I
see
your
visit
was
a
success,"
he
said
to
her.
"Oh,
yes,"
she
said,
and
she
began
telling
him
about
everything
from
the
beginning:
her
journey
with
Countess
Vrye
her
arrival,
the
accident
at
the
station.
Then
she
described
the
pity
she
had
felt,
first
for
her
brother,
and
afterwards
for
Dolly.
"I
imagine
one
cannot
exonerate
such
a
man
from
blame,
though
he
is
your
brother,"
said
Alexey
Alexei
severely.
Anna
smiled.
She
knew
that
he
said
that
simply
to
show
that
family
considerations
could
not
prevent
him
from
expressing
his
genuine
opinion.
She
knew
that
characteristic
in
her
husband,
and
liked
it.
"I
am
glad
it
has
all
ended
so
satisfactorily,
and
that
you
are
back
again,"
he
went
on.
"Come,
what
do
they
say
about
the
new
act
I
have
got
passed
in
the
councilor
Anna
had
heard
nothing
of
this
act,
and
she
felt
conscience.
at
having
been
able
so
readily
to
forget
what
was
to
him
of
such
importance.
"Here,
on
the
other
hand,
it
has
made
a
great
sensation.
he
said,
with
a
complacent
smile.
She
saw
that
Alexey
Alexei
wanted
to
tell
her
something
pleasant
to
him
about
it,
and
she
brought
him
by
questions
to
telling
it.
With
the
same
complacent
smile
he
told
her
of
the
ovations
he
had
received
in
consequence
of
the
act
he
had
passed.
"I
was
very,
very
glade
It
shows
that
at
last
a
reasonable
and
steady
view
of
the
matter
is
becoming
prevalent
among
us."
Having
drunk
his
second
cup
of
tea
with
cream,
and

got
up,
and
was
going
towards
his
study.
"And
you've
not
been
anywhere
this
evening?
You've
been
dull,
I
expect?'
he
said.
"Oh,
no!"
she
answered,
getting
up
after
him
and
accompanying
him
across
the
room
to
his
study.
"What
are
you
reading
now?"
she
asked.
"Just
now
I'm
reading
Duc
de
Lille,
_Potato

Enfield
he
answered.
"A
very
remarkable
book."
Anna
smiled,
as
people
smile
at
the
weaknesses
of
those
they
love,
and,
putting
her
hand
under
his,
she
escorted
him
to
the
door
of
the
study.
She
knew
his
habit,
that
had
grown
into
a
necessity,
of
reading
in
the
evening.
She
knew,
too,
that
in
spite
of
his
official
duties,
which
swallowed
up
almost
the
whole
of
his
time,
he
considered
it
his
duty
to
keep
up
with
everything
of
note
that
appeared
in
the
intellectual
world.
She
knew,
too,
that
he
was
really
interested
in
books
dealing
with
politics,
philosophy,
and
theology,
that
art
was
utterly
foreign
to
his
nature;
but,
in
spite
of
this,
or
rather,
in
consequence
of
it,
Alexey
Alexei
never
passed
over
anything
in
the
world
of
art,
but
made
it
his
duty
to
read
everything.
She
knew
that
in
politics,
in
philosophy,
in
theology,
Alexey
Alexei
often
had
doubts,
and
made
investigations;
but
on
questions
of
art
and
poetry,
and,
above
all,
of
music,
of
which
he
was
totally
devoid
of
understanding,
he
had
the
most
distinct
and
decided
opinions.
He
was
fond
of
talking
about
Shakespeare,
Raphael,
Beethoven,
of
the
significance
of
new
schools
of
poetry
and
music,
all
of
which
were
classified
by
him
with
very
conspicuous
consistency.
"Well,
God
be
with
you,"
she
said
at
the
door
of
the
study,
where
a
shaded
candle
and
a
decanters
of
water
were
already
put
by
his
armchair.
"And
I'll
write
to
Moscow."
He
pressed
her
hand,
and
again
kissed
it.

and

Anna
said
to
herself
going
back
to
her
room,
as
though
she
were
defending
him
to
someone
who
had
attacked
him
and
said
that
one
could
not
love
him.
"But

Precisely
at
twelve
o'clock,
when
Anna
was
still
sitting
at
her

finishing
a
letter
to
Dolly,
she
heard
the
sound
of
measured
steps
in

and
Alexey

freshly
washed
and
combed,
with
a

under

came
in
to
her.
"It's

said
he,
with
a
meaning
smile,
and
he
went
into
their
bedroom.
"And
what
right
had

to
look
at
him
like
that?"
thought
Anna,
recalling

at

she
went
into
the
bedroom;
but
her
face
had
none
of
the
eagerness
which,
during

stay
in

had
fairly
flashed
from
her
eyes
and
her
smile?
on
the

now
the

Chapter
34
When
Vrye
went
to
Moscow
from
Petersburg,
he
had
left
his
large
set
of
rooms
in
Morsman,
to
his
friend
and
favorite
comrade
Petro
Petro
was
a
young
lieutenant,
not
particularly
well-connected,
and
not
merely
not
wealthy,
but
always
hopelessly
in
debt.
Towards
evening
he
was
always
drunk,
and
he
had
often
been
locked
up
after
all
sorts
of
ludicrous
and
disgraceful
scandals,
but
he
was
a
favorite
both
of
his
comrades
and
his
superior
officers.
On
arriving
at
twelve
o'clock
from
the
station
at
his
flat,
Vrye
saw,
at
the
outer
door,
a
hired
carriage
familiar
to
him.
While
still
outside
his
own
door,
as
he
rang,
he
heard
masculine
laughter,
the
list
of
a
feminine
voice,
and
Petro
voice.
"If
that's
one
of
the
villains,
don't
let
him
in"
Vrye
told
the
servant
not
to
announce
him,
and
slipped
quietly
into
the
first
room.

at
the
round
table

coffee.

in
full
uniform,
probably
just
come
from
duty,
were
sitting
each
side
of
her.
"Bravo!"
Vrye
shouted
Petro
jumping
up,
scraping
his
chair.
"Our

him

Why,
we
didn't

he
said,
indicating
the
baronet,
"You
know

"I
should
think
so,"
said
Vrye
with
a
bright
smile,
pressing
the
baronet,
little
hand.
"What
next!"
I'm
an
old
friend."
"You're
home
after
a
journey,"
said
the
baronet,
"so
I'm
flying.
Oh,
I'll
be
off
this
minute,
if
I'm
in
the
way."
"You're
home,
wherever
you
are,

said
Vrye
"How
do
you
do,
Kameyama.
he
added,
coldly
shaking
hands
with
Kameyama.
"There,
you
never
know
how
to
say
such
pretty
things,"
said
the
baronet,
turning
to
Petro
"Nobel
what's
that
for?
After
dinner
I
say
things
quite
as
good."
"After
dinner
there's
no
credit
in
them?
Well,
then,
I'll
make
you
some
coffee,
so
go
and
wash
and
get
ready,"
said
the
baronet,
sitting
down
again,
and
anxiously
turning
the
screw
in
the
new
coffee
pot.
"Pierrette's
give
me
the
coffee,"
she
said,
addressing
Petro
whom
she
called
Pierre
as
a
contraction
of
his
surname,
making
no
secret
of
her
relations
with
him.
"I'll
put
it
in."
"You'll
spoil
it!"
"No,
I
won't
spoil
it!
Well,
and
your
wife?"
said
the
baroness
suddenly,
interrupting
Vrye
conversation
with
his
comrade;
"We've
been
marrying
you
here.
Have
you
brought
your
wife?"
"No,
baronet,
I
was
born
a
Bohemian.
and
a
Bohemian
I
shall
die."
"So
much
the
better,
so
much
the
better.
Shake
hands
on
it."
And
the
baronet,
detaining
Vrye
began
telling
him,
with
many
jokes,
about
her
last
new
plans
of
life,
asking
his
advice.
"He

in
refusing
to
give
me

she
said
contend
"he

Vrye
heard
with
pleasure
this
light-hearted
prattling
of
a
pretty
woman,
agreed
with
her,
gave
her
half-joking.
counsel,
and
altogether
dropped
at
once
into
the
tone
habitual
to
him
in
talking
to
such
women.
In
his
Petersburg
world
all
people
were
divided
into
utterly
opposed
classes.
One,
the
lower
class,
vulgar,
stupid,
and,
above
all,
ridiculous
people,
who
believe
that
one
husband
ought
to
live
with
the
one
wife
whom
he
has
lawfully
married;
that
a
girl
should
be
innocent,
a
woman
modest,
and
a
man
manly,
self-correcting
and
strong;
that
one
ought
to
bring
up
one's
children,
earn
one's
bread,
and
pay
one's
debts;
and
various
similar
absurdities.
This
was
the
class
of
old-fashioned
and
ridiculous
people.
But
there
was
another
class
of
people,
the
real
people.
To
this
class
they
all
belonged.
and
in
it
the
great
thing
was
to
be
elegant,
generous,
plucky,
gay,
to
abandon
oneself
without
a
blush
to
every
passion,
and
to
laugh
at
everything
else.
For
the
first
moment
only,
Vrye
was
startled
after
the
impression
of
a
quite
different
world
that
he
had
brought
with
him
from
Moscow.
But
immediately
as
though
slipping
his
feet
into
old
slippers,
he
dropped
back
into
the
light-hearted.
pleasant
world
he
had
always
lived
in.
The
coffee
was
never
really
made,
but
spluttering
over
every
one,
and
boiled
away,
doing
just
what
was
required

"Well

up
too,
and
Vrye
not
waiting
for
him
to
go,
shook
hands
and
went
off
to
his
dressing
room.
While
he
was
washing,
Petro
described
to
him
in
brief
outlines
his
position,
as
far
as
it
had
changed
since
Vrye
had
left
Petersburg.
No

all.
His
father
said
he
wouldn't
give
him
any
and
pay
his
debts.
His
tailor
was
trying
to
get
him
locked
up,
and
another
fellow,
too,
was
threatening
to
get
him
locked
up.
The
colonel
of
the
regiment
had
announced
that
if
these
scandals
did
not
cease
he
would
have
to
leave.
As
for
the
baronet,
he
was
sick
to
death
of
her,
especially
since
she'd
taken
to
offering
continually
to
lend
him
money.
But
he
had
found
a

He'd
had
a
row,
too,
with
Berkow,
and
was
going
to
send
seconds
to
him,
but
of
course
it
would
come
to
nothing.
Altogether
everything
was
supremely
amusing
and
jolly.
And,
not
letting
his
comrade
enter
into
further
details
of
his
position,
Petro
proceeded
to
tell
him
all
the
interesting
news.
As
he
listened
to
Petro
familiar
stories
in
the
familiar
setting
of
the
rooms
he
had
spent
the
last
three
years
in,
Vrye
felt
a
delightful
sense
of
coming
back
to
the
careless
Petersburg
life
that
he
was
used
to.
"Impossible,"
he
cried,
letting
down
the
pedal
of
the
washing
basin
in
which
he
had
been
soutane,
his
healthy
red
neck.
"Impossible,"
he
cried,
at
the
news
that
Laura

flung

Fertitta
and
had
made
up
to
Milekic
"And

Petro
"You

No,

"I

answered
Vrye
rubbing
himself
with
a
rough
towel.
"Up

or

into

long
afterwards,
when
he
was
talking
of

things,
he
broke
out
into

laugh,

PART
TWO
Chapter
1
At
the
end
of
the
winter,
in
the
Shtern
house,
a
consultation
was
being
held,
which
was
to
pronounce
on
the
state
of
Kitty,
health
and
the
measures
to
be
taken
to
restore
her
failing
strength.
She
had
been
ill,
and
as
spring
came
on
she
grew
worse.
The
family
doctor
gave
her
cod
liver
oil,
then
iron,
then
nitrate
of
silver,
but
as
the
first
and
the
second
and
the
third
were
alike
in
doing
no
good,
and
as
his
advice
when
spring
came
was
to
go
abroad,
a
celebrated
physician
was
called
in.
The
celebrated
physician,
a
very
handsome
man,
still
youngster
asked
to
examine
the
patient.
He
maintained,
with
peculiar
satisfaction,
it
seemed,
that
maiden
modesty
is
a
mere
relic
of
barbarism,
and
that
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
for
a
man
still
youngish
to
handle
a
young
girl
naked.
He
thought
it
natural
because
he
did
it
every
day,
and
felt
and
thought,
as
it
seemed
to
him,
no
harm
as
he
did
it
and
consequently
he
considered
modesty
in
the
girl
not
merely
as
a
relic
of
barbarism,
but
also
as
an
insult
to
himself.
There
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
submit,
since,
although
all
the
doctors
had
studied
in
the
same
school,
had
read
the
same
books,
and
learned
the
same
science,
and
though
some
people
said
this
celebrated
doctor
was
a
bad
doctor,
in
the
princess,
household
and
circle
it
was
for
some
reason
accepted
that
this
celebrated
doctor
alone
had
some
special
knowledge,
and
that
he
alone
could
save
Kitty.
After
a
careful
examination
and
sounding
of
the
bewildered
patient,
dazed
with
shame,
the
celebrated
doctor,
having
scrupulously
washed
his
hands,
was
standing
in
the
drawing
room
talking
to
the
prince.
The
prince
frowned
and
coughers,
listening
to
the
doctor.
As
a
man
who
had
seen
something
of
life,
and
neither
a
fool
nor
an
invalid,
he
had
no
faith
in
medicine,
and
in
his
heart
was
furious
at
the
whole
farce,
specially
as
he
was
perhaps
the
only
one
who
fully
comprehending
the
cause
of
Kitty,
illness.
"Conceivably,
blockhouse
he
thought,
as
he
listened
to
the
celebrated
doctor's
chatter
about
his
daughter's
symptoms.
The
doctor
was
meantime
with
difficulty
restraining
the
expression
of
his
contempt
for
this
old
gentleman,
and
with
difficulty
condescending
to
the
level
of
his
intelligence.
He
perceived
that
it
was
no
good
talking
to
the
old
man,
and
that
the
principal
person
in
the
house
was
the
mother.
Before
her
he
decided
to
scatter
his
pearls.
At
that
instant
the
princess
came
into
the
drawing
room
with
the
family
doctor.
The
prince
withdrew,
trying
not
to
show
how
ridiculous
he
thought
the
whole
performance.
The
princess
was
distracted,
and
did
not
know
what
to
do.
She
felt
she
had
sinned
against
Kitty.
"Well,
doctor,
decide
our
fate,"
said
the
princess.
"Tell
me
everything."
"Is
there
hope?"
she
meant
to
say,
but
her
lips
quiverer
and
she
could
not
utter
the
question.
"Well,
doctor?"
"Immigration
princess.
I
will
talk
it
over
with
my
colleague,
and
then
I
will
have
the
honor
of
laying
my
opinion
before
you."
"So
we
had
better
leave
you?"
"As
you
please."
The
princess
went
out
with
a
sigh.
When
the
doctors
were
left
alone,
the
family
doctor
began
timidly
explaining
his
opinion,
that
there
was
a
commencement
of
tubers
trouble,
but
...
and
so
on.
The
celebrated
doctor
listened
to
him,
and
in
the
middle
of
his
sentence
looked
at
his
big
gold
watch.
"Yes,"
said
he.
"Butch
The
family
doctor
respectfully
ceased
in
the
middle
of
his
observations.
"The
commencement
of
the
tubers

are
not,
as
you
are
aware,

there

is
nothing

But
we
may
suspect
it.
And
there
are
indicative

nervous
excitable
and
so
on.
The
question
stands
thus:
in
presence
of
indications
of
tubers
process,
what
is
to
be
done
to
maintain
nutritional
"But,
you
know,
there
are
always
moral,
spiritual
causes
at
the
back
in
these
cases,"
the
family
doctor
permitted
himself
to
interpolated
with
a
subtle
smile.
"Yes,
that's
an
understood
thing,"
responded
the
celebrated
physician,
again
glancing
at
his
watch.
"Beggars
pardon,
is
the
Yavad
bridge
done
yet,
or
shall
I
have
to
drive
around?"
he
asked.
"Ah!
it
is.
Oh,
well,
then
I
can
do
it
in
twenty
minutes.
So
we
were
saying
the
problem
may
be
put
thus:
to
maintain
nutrition
and
to
give
tone
to
the
nerves.
The
one
is
in
close
connection
with
the
other,
one
must
attack
both
sides
at
once."
"And
how
about
a
tour
abroad?'
asked
the
family
doctor.
"I've
no
liking
for
foreign
tours.
And
take
note:
if
there
is
an
early
stage
of
tubers
process,
of
which
we
cannot
be
certain,
a
foreign
tour
will
be
of
no
use.
What
is
wanted
is
means
of
improving
nutrition,
and
not
for
lowering
it."
And
the
celebrated
doctor
expounded
his
plan
of
treatment
with
Soden
waters,
a
remedy
obviously
prescribed
primarily
on
the
ground
that
they
could
do
no
harm.
The
family
doctor
listened
attentively
and
respecting
"But
in
favor
of
foreign
travel
I
would
urge
the
change
of
habits,
the
removal
from
conditions
calling
up
reminiscences.
And
then
the
mother
wishes
it,"
he
added.
"Ah!
Well,
in
that
case,
to
be
sure,
let
them
go.
Only,
those
German
quacks
are
mischievously
They
ought
to
be
persuades
Well,
let
them
go
then."
He
glanced
once
more
at
his
watch.
"Oh!
time's
up
already,"
And
he
went
to
the
door.
The
celebrated
doctor
announced
to
the
princess
(a
feeling
of
what
was
due
from
him
dictated
his
doing
so)
that
he
ought
to
see
the
patient
once
more.
"What's
another
examination,
cried
the
mother,
with
horror.
"Oh,
no,
only
a
few
details,
princesses
"Come
this
way."
And
the
mother,
accompanied
by
the
doctor,
went
into
the
drawing
room
to
Kitty.
Wastell
and
flushed,
with
a
peculiar
glitter
in
her
eyes,
left
there
by
the
agony
of
shame
she
had
been
put
through,
Kitty
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room.
When
the
doctor
came
in
she
flushed
crimson-
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears.
All
her
illness
and
treatment
struck
her
as
a
thing
so
stupid,
ludicrous

Doctorow
her
seemed
to
her
as
absurd
as
putting
together
the
pieces
of
a
broken
vase.
Her
heart
was
broken.
Why
would
they
try
to
cure
her
with
pills
and
powdery
But
she
could
not
grieve
her
mother,
especially
as
her
mother
considered
herself
to
blame.
"May
I

to
sit
down,
princesses
the
celebrated
doctor
said
to
her.
He
sat
down
with
a
smile,
facing
her,
felt
her
pulse,
and
again
began
asking
her
tiresome
questions.
She
answered
him,
and
all
at
once
got
up,
furious.
"Excuse
me,
doctor,
but
there
is
really
no
object
in
this.
This
is
the
third
time
you've
asked
me
the
same
thing."
The
celebrated
doctor
did
not
take
offense.
"Nervous

he
said
to
the
princess,
when
Kitty
had
left
the
room.
"However,
I
had
finished:
And
the
doctor
began
scientifically
explaining
to
the
princess,
as
an
exceptionally
intelligent
woman,
the
condition
of
the
young
princess,
and
concluded
by
insisting
on
the
drinking
of
the
waters,
which
were
certainly
harmless.
At
the
question:
Should
they
go
abroad?
the
doctor
plunged
into
deep
meditation,
as
though
resolving
a
weighty
problem.
Finally
his
decision
was
pronounced:
they
were
to
go
abroad,
but
to
put
no
faith
in
foreign
quad
and
to
apply
to
him
in
any
need.
It
seemed
as
though
some
piece
of
good
fortune
had
come
to
pass
after
the
doctor
had
gone.
The
mother
was
much
more
cheerful
when
she
went
back
to
her
daughter,
and
Kitty
pretended
to
be
more
cheerful.
She
had
often,
almost
always,
to
be
pretending
now.
"Really,
I'm
quite
well,
mammal
But
if
you
want
to
go
abroad,
let's
go!"
she
said,
and
trying
to
appear
interested
in
the
proposed
tour,
she
began
talking
of
the
preparations
for
the
journey.
Chapter
2
Soon
after
the
doctor,
Dolly
had
arrived.
She
knew
that
there
was
to
be
a
consultation
that
day,
and
though
she
was
only
just
up
after
her
confinement
(she
had
another
baby,
a
little
girl,
born
at
the
end
of
the
winter,
though
she
had
trouble
and
anxiety

of
her
own,
she
had
left
her
tiny
baby
and
a
sick
child,
to
come
and

fate,
which
was
to
be
decided
that
day.
"Well,
well?'
she
said,
coming
into
the
drawing
room,
without
taking
off
her
hat.
"You're
all
in
good
spirits.
Good
news,
then?"
They
tried
to
tell
her
what
the
doctor
had
said,
but
it
appeared
that
though
the
doctor
had
talked
distinctly
enough
and
at
great
length,
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
report
what
he
had
said.
The
only
point
of
interest
was
that
it
was
settled
they
should
go
abroad.
Dolly
could
not
help
sighing.
Her
dearest
friend,
her
sister,
was
going
away.
And
her
life
was
not
a
cheerful
one.
Her
relations
with
Stepan
Arkalyk
after
their
reconciliation
had
become
humiliating.
The
union
Anna
had
cemented
turned
out
to
be
of
no
solid
character,
and
family
harmony
was
breaking
down
again
at
the
same
point.
There
had
been
nothing
definite,
but
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
hardly
ever
at
home;
money,
too,
was
hardly
ever
forthcoming,
and
Dolly
was
continually
tortured
by
suspicions
of
infidelity,
which
she
tried
to
dismiss,
dreading
the
agonies
of
jealousy
she
had
been
through
already.
The
first
onslaught
of
jealousy,
once
lived
through,
could
never
come
back
again,
and
even
the
discovery
of
infidelities
could
never
now
affect
her
as
it
had
the
first
time.
Such
a
discovery
now
would
only
mean
breaking
up
family
habits,
and
she
let
herself
be
deceived,"
despising
him
and
still
more
herself,
for
the
weakness.
Besides
this,
the
care
of
her
large
family
was
a
constant
worry
to
her:
first,
the
nursing
of
her
young
baby
did
not
go
well,
then
the
nurse
had
gone
away,
now
one
of
the
children
had
fallen
ill.
"Well,
how
are
all
of
you?"
asked
her
mother.
"Ah,
mammal
we
have
plenty
of
troubles
of
our
own.
Lili
is
ill,
and
I'm
afraid
it's

come
here
now
to
hear
about
Kitty,
and

myself

null

The
old
prince
too
had
come
in
from
his
study
after
the
doctor's
departure,
and
after
presenting
his
cheek
to
Dolly,
and
saying
a
few
words
to
her,
he
turned
to
his
wife:
"How
have
you
settled
it?
you're
going?
Well,
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
with
me?"
"I
suppose
you
had
better
stay
here,
Alexander.
said
his
wife.
"That's
as
you
like."
"Mammals"
why
shouldn't

come
with
us?"
said
Kitty.
"It
would
be
nicer
for
him
and
for
us
too."
The
old
prince
got
up
and
stroked
Kitty,
hair.
She
lifted
her
head
and
looked
at
him
with
a
forced
smile.
It
always
seemed
to
her
that
he
understood
her
better
than
anyone
in
the
family,
though
he
did
not
say
much
about
her.
Being
the
youngest,
she
was
her
father's
favorite,
and
she
fancied
that
his
love
gave
him
insight.
When
now
her
glance
met
his
blue
kindly
eyes
looking
intently
at
her,
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
saw
right
through
her,
and
understood
all
that
was
not
good
that
was
passing
within
her.
Reddick
she
stretched
out
towards
him
expecting
a
kiss,
but
he
only
patted
her
hair
and
said:

answered
Dolly,
understanding
that

"He's

she
could
not
resist

with
a
sarcastic

"Oh,

said
the
prince.
"And

to
be
getting

for
a
journey
too?
At
your
service,"
he
said
to
his
wife,
sitting
down.
"And

went
on
to
his

daughter,

What
her
father
said
seemed
simple
enough,
yet
at
these
words
Kitty
became
confused
and
overcome
like
a
detected
criminal.
"Yes,
he
sees
it
all,
he
understands
it
all,
and
in
these
words
he's
telling
me
that
though
I'm
ashamed,
I
must
get
over
my
shame."
She
could
not
pluck
up
spirit
to
make
any
answer.
She
tried
to
begin,
and
all
at
once
burst
into
tears,
and
rushed
out
of
the
room.
"See
what
comes
of
your
jokes"
the
princess
pounced
down
on
her
husband.
"You're

began
a
string
of

The
prince
listened
to
the
princess,
scolding
rather
a
long
while
without
speaking,
but
his
face
was
more
and
more
frowns
"She's
so
much
to

you
don't

the

and
by
the
change
in
her
tone
both

and

knew
she
was

said
the
prince
gloomy
getting
up
from
his
low
chair,
and
seeming
anxious
to
get
away,
yet
stopping
in
the
doorway.
"There
are

madam,

since
you've
challenged
me
to
it,

The
prince
apparently
had
plenty
more
to
say,
but
as
soon
as
the
princess
heard
his
tone
she
subsided
at
once,
and
became
penitent,

she
always
did

serious
occasions.

whispered.

to
him
and
beginning
to
weep.
As
soon
as
she
began
to
cry
the
prince
too
calmed
down.
He
went
up
to
her.
"There,
that's
enough,

You're
wretched
too,
I
know.
It
can't
be

There's

thanksgiving
he
said,
not
knowing
what
he
was
saying,
as
he
responded
to
the
tearful
kiss
of
the
princess
that
he
felt
on
his
hand.
And
the
prince
went
out
of
the
room.
Before
this,
as
soon
as
Kitty
went
out
of
the
room
in
tears,
Dolly,
with
her
mothers
family
instincts,
had
promptly
perceived
that
here
a
woman's
work
lay
before
her,
and
she
prepared
to
do
it.
She
took
off
her
hat,
and,
morally
speaking,
tucked
up
her
sleeves
and
prepared
for
action.
While
her
mother
was
attacking
her
father,
she
tried
to
restrain
her
mother,
so
far
as
filial
reverence
would
allow.
During
the
prince's
outburst
she
was
silent?
she
felt
ashamed
for
her
mother,
and
tender
towards
her
father
for
so
quickly
being
kind
again.
But
when
her
father
left
them
she
made
ready
for
what
was
the
chief
thing
needier
go
to
Kitty
and
console
her.
"I'd

you
know
that
Levin
meant
to
make
Kitty
an
offer

he
was
here

last

He
told
Stivaletti
so."
"Well,
what
then?
I
don't
understand:
"So
did
Kitty

She
didn't
tell
you
so?"
"No,

has
said
nothing

of

or

she's
too
proud.
But
I
know
it's
all
on
account
of
the

"Yes,
but
suppose
she
has
refused
Levin,
and
she
wouldn't
have
refused
him
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the

It
was
too
terrible
for
the
princess
to
think
how
she
had
sinned
against
her
daughter,
and
she
broke
out
angrily.
"Oh,
I
really
don't
understand"
Nowadays
they
will
all
go
their
own
way,
and
mothers
haven't
a
word
to
say
in
anything,
and
then:
"Mammals"
I'll
go
up
to
her."
"Well,
do.
Did
I
tell
you
not
to?"
said
her
mother.
Chapter
3
When
she
went
into
Kitty,
little
room,
a
pretty,
pink
little
room,
full
of
knick-knacks
in
_were
saxophone
as
fresh,
and
pink,
and
white,
and
gay
as
Kitty
herself
had
been
two
months
ago,
Dolly
remembered
how
they
had
decorated
the
room
the
year
before
together,
with
what
love
and
gaiety.
Her
heart
turned
cold
when
she
saw
Kitty
sitting
on
a
low
chair
near
the
door,
her
eyes
fixed
immume
on
a
corner
of
the
rug.
Kitty
glanced
at
her
sister,
and
the
cold,
rather
ill-tempered
expression
of
her
face
did
not
change.
"I'm
just
going
now,
and
I
shall
have
to
keep
in
and
you
won't
be
able
to
come
to
see
me,"
said
Dolly,
sitting
down
beside
her.
"I
want
to
talk
to
you."
"What
about?"
Kitty
asked
swiftly,
lifting
her
head
in
dismay.
"What
should
it
be,
but
your
trouble?'
"I
have
no
trouble."
"Nonsense,"
Kitty.
Do
you
suppose
I
could
help
knowingly
I
know
all
about
it.
And
believe
me,
it's
of
so
little
consequence;
We've
all
been
through
it."
Kitty
did
not
speak,
and
her
face
had
a
stern
expression.
"He's
not
worth
your

coming

to
the
point.
"No,

has
treated
me
with
contempt,"
said
Kitty,
in
a
breaking
voice.
"Don't
talk
of
it!
Please,
don't
talk
of
it!"
"But
who
can
have
told
you
so?
No

has
said
that.
I'm

"Oh,
the
most
awful
thing
of
all
for

shrieked
Kitty,
suddenly
flying
into
a
passion.
She
turned
round
on
her
chair,
flushed
crimson-
and
rapidly
moving
her
fingers,
pinched
the
clasp
of
her
belt
first
with
one
hand
and
then
with
the
other.
Dolly
knew
this
trick
her
sister
had
of
clenching
her
hands
when
she
was
much
excitedly
she
knew,
too,
that
in
moments
of
excitement
Kitty
was
capable
of
forgetting
herself
and
saying
a
great
deal
too
much,
and
Dolly
would
have
soothed
her,
but
it
was
too
late.
"What,
what

said
Kitty
quickly.
"That

am
too

her
by
the

The
mention
of
Levin's
name
seemed
to
deprive
Kitty
of
the
last
vestige
of
self-control.
She
leaped
up
from
her
chair,
and
flinging
her
clasp
on
the
ground,
she
gesticulated
rapidly
with
her
hands
and
said:
"Why

Levin

too?
I
can't
understand
what
you
want
to

who

I

You

but
I

And
saying
these
words
she
glanced
at
her
sister,
and
seeing
that
Dolly
sat
silent,
her
head
mournfully
bowed,
Kitty,
instead
of
running
out
of
the
room
as
she
had
meant
to
do,
sat
down
near
the
door,
and
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief.
The
silence
lasted
for
two
minutes:
Dolly
was
thinking
of
herself.
That
humiliation
of
which
she
was
always
conscious
came
back
to
her
with
a
peculiar
bitterness
when
her
sister
reminded
her
of
it.
She
had
not
looked
for
such
cruelty
in
her
sister,
and
she
was
angry
with
her.
But
suddenly
she
heard
the
rustle
of
a
skirt,
and
with
it
the
sound
of
heart-rending,
smothered
sobbing,
and
felt
arms
about
her
neck.
Kitty
was
on
her
knees
before
her.

And
the
sweet
face

itself

As
though
tears
were
the
indispensable
oil,
without
which
the
machinery
of
mutual
confidence
could
not
run
smoothly
between
the
two
sisters,
the
sisters
after
their
tears
talked,
not
of
what
was
uppermost
in
their
minds,
but,
though
they
talked
of
outside

they
understood

Kitty
knew
that
the
words
she
had
uttered
in
anger
about
her
husband's
infidelity
and
her
humiliating
position
had
cut
her

Kitty
said
not
a
word
of
that;
she
talked
of
nothing
but
her

she
said,

that

to

that

"Oh,

she
went
on.
"That's

"But

"I

Kitty
insisted
on
having
her

and
went
to

at

nursed
the

all
through

Chapter

The
highest
Petersburg
society
is
essentially
one:
in
it
everyone
knows
everyone
else,
everyone
even
visits
everyone
else.
But
this
great
set
has
its
subdivisions.
Anna
Arkalyk
Karenina
had
friends
and
close
ties
in
three
different
circles
of
this
highest
society.
One
circle
was
her
husband's
government
official
set,
consisting
of
his
colleagues
and
subordinates,
brought
together
in
the
most
various
and
capricious
manner,
and
belonging
to
different
social
strata.
Anna
found
it
difficult
now
to
recall
the
feeling
of
almost
awe-struck
reverence
which
she
had
at
first
entertained
for
these
persons.
Now
she
knew
all
of
them
as
people
know
one
another
in
a
country
town;
she
knew
their
habits
and
weaknesses,
and
where
the
shoe
pinched
each
one
of
them.
She
knew
their
relations
with
one
another
and
with
the
head
authorities,
knew
who
was
for
whom,
and
how
each
one
maintained
his
position,
and
where
they
agreed
and
disagreed.
But
the
circle
of
political,
masculine
interests
had
never
interested
her,
in
spite
of
countess
Lidia
Ivanovo.
influence,
and
she
avoided
it.
Another
little
set
with
which
Anna
was
in
close
relations
was
the
one
by
means
of
which
Alexey
Alexei
had
made
his
career.
The
center
of
this
circle
was
the
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovo.
It
was
a
set
made
up
of
elderly,
ugly,
benevolent,
and
godly
women,
and
clever,
learned,
and
ambitious
men.
One
of
the
clever
people
belonging
to
the
set
had
called
it
"the
conscience
of
Petersburg
society."
Alexey
Alexei
had
the
highest
esteem
for
this
circle,
and
Anna
with
her
special
gift
for
getting
on
with
everyone,
had
in
the
early
days
of
her
life
in
Petersburg
made
friends
in
this
circle
also.
Now,
since
her
return
from
Moscow,
she
had
come
to
feel
this
set
insufferable.
It
seemed
to
her
that
both
she
and
all
of
them
were
insincere,
and
she
felt
so
bored
and
ill
at
ease
in
that
world
that
she
went
to
see
the
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovo.
as
little
as
possible.
The
third
circle
with
which
Anna
had
ties
was
preempt
the
fashionable
world-amid
world
of
balls,
of
dinners,
of
sumptuous
dresses,
the
world
that
hung
on
to
the
court
with
one
hand,
so
as
to
avoid
sinking
to
the
level
of
the
demi.
For
the
demi.
the
members
of
that
fashionable
world
believed
that
they
despised,
though
their
tastes
were
not
merely
similar,
but
in
fact
identical.
Her
connection
with
this
circle
was
kept
up
through
Princess
Betsy
Tvorba
her
cousin's
wife,
who
had
an
income
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
roubles,
and
who
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
Anna
ever
since
she
first
came
out,
showed
her
much
attention,
and
drew
her
into
her
set,

fun

"When
I'm

Betsy
used
to
say;
"but

young
woman
like
you

because
it
necessitated
an
expenditure
beyond
her
means,
and
besides
in
her
heart
she
preferred
the
first
circle.
But
since
her
visit
to
Moscow
she
had
done
quite
the
contrary.
She
avoided
her
serious-minded
friends,
and
went
out
into
the
fashionable
world.
There
she
met
Vrye
and
experienced
an
agitating
joy
at
those
meetings.
She
met
Vrye
specially
often
at
Betsy's
for
Betsy
was
a
Vrye
by
birth
and
his
cousin.
Vrye
was
everywhere
where
he
had
any
chance
of
meeting
Anna,
and
speaking
to
her,
when
he
could,
of
his
love.
She
gave
him
no
encouragement,
but
every
time
she
met
him
there
surged
up
in
her
heart
that
same
feeling
of
quickened
life
that
had
come
upon
her
that
day
in
the
railway
carriage
when
she
saw
him
for
the
first
time.
She
was
conscious
herself
that
her
delight
sparkled
in
her
eyes
and
curved
her
lips
into
a
smile,
and
she
could
not
quench
the
expression
of
this
delight.
At
first
Anna
sincerely
believed
that
she
was
displeased
with
him
for
daring
to
pursue
her.
Soon
after
her
return
from
Moscow,
on
arriving
at
a
_subscribed
where
she
had
expected
to
meet
him,
and
not
finding
him
there,
she
realized
distinctly
from
the
rush
of
disappointment
that
she
had
been
deceiving
herself,
and
that
this
pursuit
was
not
merely
not
distasteful
to
her,
but
that
it
made
the
whole
interest
of
her
life.
A
celebrated
singer
was
singing
for
the
second
time,
and
all
the
fashionable
world
was
in
the
theater.
Vrye
seeing
his
cousin
from
his
stall
in
the
front
row,
did
not
wait
till
the
entraces
but
went
to
her
box.
"Why
didn't
you
come
to
dinners
she
said
to
him.
"I
marvel
at
the
second
sight
of
lovers.
she
added
with
a
smile,
so
that
no
one
but
he
could
heard
"`A

thereabouts,
But
come
after
the
opera."
Vrye
looked
inquiry
at
her.
She
nodded.
He
thanked
her
by
a
smile,
and
sat
down
beside
her.
"But
how
I
remember
your
jeers,
continued
Princess
Betsy,
who
took
a
peculiar
pleasure
in
following
up
this
passion
to
a
successful
issue.
"What's
become
of
all
that?
You're
caught,
my
dear
boy."
"That's
my
one
desire,
to
be
caught,"
answered
Vrye
with
his
serene,
good-humored
smile.
"If
I
complain
of
anything
it's
only
that
I'm
not
caught
enough,
to
tell
the
truth.
I
begin
to
lose
hope."
"Why,
whatever
hope
can
you
have?"
said
Betsy,

of

in
her
eyes
there
were

betrayed
that
she
understood
perfectly
and
precisely
as
he
did
what
hope
he
might
have.
"None
whatever,"
said
Vrye
laughing
and
showing
his
even
rows
of
teeth.
"Excuse
me,"
he
added,
taking
an
opera
glass
out
of
her
hand,
and
proceeding
to

over
her
bare
shoulder,
the
row
of
boxes
facing
them.
"I'm
afraid
I'm
becoming
ridiculous."
He
was
very
well
aware
that
he
ran
no
risk
of
being
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
Betsy
or
any
other
fashionable
people.
He
was
very
well
aware
that
in
their
eyes
the
position
of
an
unsuccessful
lover
of
a
girl,
or
of
any
woman
free
to
marry,
might
be
ridiculous.
But
the
position
of
a
man
pursuing
a
married
woman,
and,
regardless

everything,
staking
his
life
on
drawing
her
into

has
something
fine
and
grand
about
it,
and
can
never
be

and
so
it
was
with
a
proud
and
gay
smile
under
his
mustaches
that
he
lowered
the
opera
glass
and
looked
at
his
cousin.
"But

"You
describe
it
with
such
feeling
that
I
fancy
you
must
be
one
of
the

"And
after
what
you
said,
just
now!
Well,
the
young
men
go
in
to
their
comrade,
he
was
giving
a
farewell
dinner.
There
they
certainly
did
drink
a
little
too
much,
as
one
always
does
at
farewell
dinners.
And
at
dinner
they
inquire
who
lives
at
the
top
in
that
house.
No
one
knows?
only
their
host's
valet,
in
answer
to
their
inquiry
whether
any
'young
ladies'
are
living
on
the
top
floor,
answered
that
there
were
a
great
many
of
them
about
there.
After
dinner
the
two
young
men
go
into
their
host's
study,
and
write
a
letter
to
the
unknown
fair
one.
They
compose
an
ardent
epistolary
a
declaration
in
fact,
and
they
carry
the
letter
upstairs
themselves,
so
as
to
elucidate
whatever
might
appear
not
perfectly
intelligible
in
the
letter."
"Why
are
you
telling
me
these
horrible
stories?
Wella
"They
ring.
A
maid-service
opens
the
door,
they
hand
her
the
letter,
and
assure
the
maid
that
they're
both
so
in
love
that
they'll
die
on
the
spot
at
the
door.
The
maid,
stupefying
carries
in
their
messages.
All
at
once
a
gentleman
appears
with
whiskers
like
sausages,
as
red
as
a
lobster,
announces
that
there
is
no
one
living
in
the
flat
except
his
wife,
and
sends
them
both
about
their
business."
"How
do
you
know
he
had
whiskers
like
sausages,
as
you
say?"
"Ah,
you
shall
hear.
I've
just
been
to
make
peace
between
them."
"Well,
and
what
then?"
"That's
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
story.
It
appears
that
it's
a
happy
couple,
a
government
clerk
and
his
lady.
The
government
clerk
lodges
a
complaint,
and
I
became
a
mediator,
and
such
a
mediator"
I
assure
you
Tallia
couldn't

"Why,
where
was
the
difficulty?"
"Ah,
you
shall
hear:
We
apologize
in
due
form:
we
are
in
despair,
we
entreat
forgiveness
for
the
unfortunate
misunderstanding.
The
government
clerk
with
the
sausages
begins
to
melt,
but
he,
too,
desires
to
express
his
sentiments,
and
as
soon
as
ever
he
begins
to
express
them,
he
begins
to
get
hot
and
say
nasty
things,
and
again
I'm
obliged
to
trot
out
all
my
diplomatic
talents.
I
allowed
that
their
conduct
was
bad,
but
I
urged
him
to
take
into
consideration
their
heeds
their
youth?
then,
too,
the
young
men
had
only
just
been
lunching
together.
'You
understand.

regret
it
deeply,

beg
you
to

The

was

And
you
must
understand,
the
young
upstarts
are
present
all
the
while,
and
I
have
to
keep
the

them.
Again
I
call
out
all
my
diplomacy,
and
again
as
soon
as
the
thing
was
about
at
an
end,
our
friend
the
government

gets
hot
and

and
his

with

and
once

into

"Ah,
he
must
tell
you
this
story"
said
Betsy,
laughing,
to
a
lady
who
came
into
her
box.
"He
has
been
making
me
laugh
so."
"Well,
_briefly

she
added,

Vrye
one
finger
of
the

she
held

down
the

of

she

forward
towards
the
footlights
into
the
light
of
the
gas,
and
the
sight
of
all
eyes.
Vrye
drove
to
the
French
theater,
where
he
really
had
to
see
the
colonel
of
his
regiment,
who
never
missed
a
single
performance
there.
He
wanted
to
see
him,
to
report
on
the
result
of
his
mediation,
which
had
occupied
and
amused
him
for
the
last
three
days.
Petro
whom
he
liked,
was
implicated
in
the
affair,
and
the
other
culprit
was
a
capital
fellow
and
first-rate
comrade,
who
had
lately
joined
the
regiment,
the
young
Prince
Kefalari
And
what
was
most
important,
the
interests
of
the
regiment
were
involved
in
it
too.
Both
the
young
men
were
in
Vrye
company.
The
colonel
of
the
regiment
was
waited
upon
by
the
government
clerk,
Vendig
with
a
complaint
against
his
officers,
who
had
insulted
his
wife.
His
young
wife,
so
Vendig
told
the
story-book
had
been
married
half
a
year-after-year
at
church
with
her
mother,
and
suddenly
overcome
by
indisputable
arising
from
her
interesting
condition,
she
could
not
remain
standing,
she
drove
home
in
the
first
sledgehammer
a
smart-money
one,
she
came
across.
On
the
spot
the
officers
set
off
in
pursuit
of
her;
she
was
alarmed,
and
feeling
still
more
unwholesome
ran
up
the
staircase
home.
Vendig
himself,
on
returning
from
his
office,
heard
a
ring
at
their
bell
and
voices,
went
out,
and
seeing
the
intoxicated
officers
with
a
letter,
he
had
turned
them
out.
He
asked
for
exemplary
punishment.
"Yes,
it's
all
very
well,"
said
the
colonel
to
Vrye
whom
he
had
invited
to
come
and
see
him.
"Petroleum
becoming
impossible.
Not
a
week
goes
by
without
some
scandal.
This
government
clerk
won't
let
it
drop,
he'll
go
on
with
the
thing."
Vrye
saw
all
the
thanks
of
the
business,
and
that
there
could
be
no
question
of
a
duel
in
it,
that
everything
must
be
done
to
soften
the
government
clerk,
and
hush
the
matter
up.
The
colonel
had
called
in
Vrye
just
because
he
knew
him
to
be
an
honorable
and
intelligent
man,
and,
more
than
all,
a
man
who
cared
for
the
honor
of
the
regiment.
They
talked
it
over,
and
decided
that
Petro
and
Kefalari
must
go
with
Vrye
to
Vendig
to
apologize.
The
colonel
and
Vrye
were
both
fully
aware
that
Vrye
name
and
rank
would
be
sure
to
contribute
greatly
to
the
softening
of
the
injured
husband's
feelings.
And
these
two
influences
were
not
in
fact
without
effect;
though
the
result
remained,
as
Vrye
had
described,
uncertain.
On
reaching
the
French
theater,
Vrye
retired
to
the
foyer
with
the
colonel,
and
reported
to
him
his
success,
or
non-suicidal
The
colonel,
thinking
it
all
over,
made
up
his
mind
not
to
pursue
the
matter
further,
but
then
for
his
own
satisfaction
proceeded
to
cross-examine
Vrye
about
his
interview;
and
it
was
a
long
while
before
he
could
restrain
his
laughter,
as
Vrye
described
how
the
government
clerk,
after
subsiding
for
a
while,
would
suddenly
flare
up
again,
as
he
recalled
the
details,
and
how
Vrye
at
the
last
half
word
of
conciliation,
skillfully
maneuvered
a
retreat,
shoving
Petro
out
before
him.
"It's
a
disgraceful
story,
but
killing.
Kefalari
really
can't
fight
the
gentleman"
Was
he
so
awfully
hot?"
he
commented,
laughing.
"But
what
do
you
say
to
Claire
today?
She's
marvelous,"
he
went
on,
speaking
of
a
new
French
actress.
"However
often
you
see
her,
every
day
she's
different.
It's
only
the
French
who
can
do
that."
Chapter
6
Princess
Betsy
drove
home
from
the
theater,
without
waiting
for
the
end
of
the
last
act.
She
had
only
just
time
to
go
into
her
dressing
room,
sprinkle
her
long,
pale
face
with
powder,
rub
it,
set
her
dress
to
rights,
and
order

in
the
big
drawing
room,
when
one
after
another
carriages
drove
up
to
her
huge
house
in
Bolshakov
Morsman,
Her
guests
stepped
out
at
the
wide
entrance,
and
the
stout
portering
who
used
to
read
the
newspapers
in
the
mornings
behind
the
glass
door,
to
the
edifice
of
the
passers-by,
noisely
opened
the
immense
door,
letting
the
visitors
pass
by
him
into
the
house.
Almost
at
the
same
instant
the
hostess,
with
freshly
arranged
coiffure
and
freshened
face,
walked
in
at
one
door
and
her
guests
at
the
other
door
of
the
drawing
room,
a
large
room
with
dark
walls,
downy
rugs,
and
a
brightly
lighted
table,
gleaming
with
the
light
of
candles,
white
cloth,
silver
samovar,
and
transparent
china

things.
The
hostess
sat
down
at
the
table
and
took
off
her
gloves.
Chairs
were
set
with
the
aid
of
footmen,
moving
almost
imperceptibly
about
the
room;
the
party
settled
itself,
divided
into
two
groups:
one
round
the
samovar,
near
the
hostess,
the
other
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
drawing
room,
round
the
handsome
wife
of
an
ambassador,
in
black
velvet,
with
sharply
defined
black
eyebrows.
In
both
groups
conversation
wavered.
as
it
always
does,
for
the
first
few
minutes,
broken
up
by
meetings,
greetings,
offers
of
tea,
and
as
it
were,
feeling
about
for
something
to
rest
upon.

good

"Oh,

about

a

an

Princess
Myanmar
sitting
in
the
middle
between
the
two
groups,
and
listening
to
both,
took
part
in
the
conversation
first
of
one
and
then
of
the
other.
"Three
people
have
used
that
very
phrase
about
Kaulfers
to
me
today
already,
just
as
though
they
had
made
a
compact
about
it.
And
I
can't
see
why
they
liked
that
remark
so."
The
conversation
was
cut
short
by
this
observation,
and
a
new
subject
had
to
be
thought
of
again.
"Do
tell
me
something
amusing
but
not

said
the
ambassador's
wife,
a
great
proficient
in
the
art
of
that

She
addressed
the
attache,
who
was
at
a
loss
now
what
to
begin
upon.
"They

a
difficult
task,
that
nothing's

he
began
with
a
smile.
"But
I'll
try.
Get
me
a
subject.
It
all
lies
in
the
subject.
If
a
subject's
given
me,
it's
easy
to
spin
something
round
it.
I
often
think
that
the
celebrated
talkers
of
the
last
century
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
talk
cleverly
now.
Everything
clever
is
so
stale;
"That
has
been
said
long
ago,"
the
ambassador's
wife
interrupted
him,
laughing.
The
conversation
began
amiably.
but
just
because
it
was
too
amiable.
it
came
to
a
stop
again.
They
had
to
have
recourse
to
the
sure,
never-finished
topic.
"Don't
you
think
there's
something
Louis
Quirin
about
Tushnet
he
said,
glancing
towards
a
handsome,
fair-haired
young
man,
standing
at
the
table.
"Oh,
yes!"
He's
in
the
same
style
as
the
drawing
room
and
that's
why
it
is
he's
so
often
here."
This
conversation
was
maintained,
since
it
rested
on
allusions
to
what
could
not
be
talked
of
in
that
room-and-board
is
to
say,
of
the
relations
of
Tushnet
with
their
hostess.
Round
the
samovar,
and
the
hostess
the
conversation
had
been
meanwhile
vacillating
in
just
the
same
way
between
three
inevitable
topics:
the
latest
piece
of
public
news,
the
theater,
and
scandal.
It,
too,
came
finally
to
rest
on
the
last
topic,
that
is,
ill-observed
gossip.
"Have
you
heard
the
Malton
woman-owned
mother,
not
the
daughter-in-law

a

"Nonsense,"
No,

that

is."
Everyone
had
something
to
say
in
censure
or
ridicule
of
the
luckless
Madame
Malton
and
the
conversation

merriment
like

The

of
Princess

hearing
that

came
into
the
drawing
room
before
going
to
his

Stepping
noisely
over
the
thick
rugs,
he
went
up
to
Princess

Princess
Myanmar
said,
speaking
loudly,
and
conscious
everyone
was
listening?
"and

it
was,

had

"She's

said
the
lady
of
the
house.
"Marvels

someone.
The
sensation
produced
by

was
always
unique,
and
the
secret
of
the
sensation
she
produced
lay
in
the
fact
that
though
she
spoke
not
always
appropriately,
as
now,
she
said
simple
things
with
some
sense
in
them.

Princess
Myanmar
could
never
see
why
it
had
that
effect,
but
she
knew
it
had,
and
took
advantage
of
it.
As
everyone
had
been
listening
while
Princess
Myanmar
spoke,
and
so
the
conversation
around
the
ambassador's
wife
had
dropped,
Princess
Betsy
tried
to
bring
the
whole
party
together,
and
turned
to
the
ambassador's
wife.
"Will
you
really
not
have
tea?
You
should
come
over
here
by
us."
"No,
we're
very
happy
here,"
the
ambassador's
wife
responded
with
a
smile,
and
she
went
on
with
the
conversation
that
had
been
begun.
It
was
a
very
agreeable
conversation.
They
were
criticizing
the
Karennis
husband
and
wife.
"Anna
is
quite
changed
since
her
stay
in
Moscow.
There's
something
strange
about
her,"
said
her
friend.
"The
great
change
is
that
she
brought
back
with
her
the
shadow
of
Alexey
Vrye
said
the
ambassador's
wife.
"Well,
what
of
it?
There's
a
fable
of
Grimm's
about
a
man
without
a
shadow,
a
man
who's
lost
his
shadow.
And
that's
his
punishment
for
something.
I
never
could
understand
how
it
was
a
punishment.
But
a
woman
must
dislike
being
without
a
shadow."
"Yes,
but
women
with
a
shadow
usually
come
to
a
bad
end,"
said
Anna's
friend.
"Bad

your
tongue,
said
Princess
Myanmar
suddenly.
"Madame
Karennis

don't

said
the

"And
my

me

she
turned
to
Anna,
who,
with
a
faintly
perceptible

smile
on
her
lips,
was
listening
in
silence
to
the
conversation.
"I

Anna,

had

off,

Vrye
was
gazing
at
Anna,
and
with
a
fainting
heart
waiting
for
what
she
would
say.
He
sighed
as
after
a
danger
escaped
when
she
uttered
these
words.
Anna
suddenly
turned
to
him.
"Oh,
I
have
had
a
letter
from

They

me

"Realpolitik"

Vrye
knitting
his
brows.
Anna
looked
sternly
at
him.
"That
doesn't
interest
you?"
"On
the
contrary,
it
does,
very
much.
What
was
it
exactly

told
you,
if
I
may
know?"
he
questioned.
Anna
got
up
and
went
to

"Give

a
cup
of
tea,"
she
said,
standing
at
her
table.
While
Betsy
was
pouring
out
the
tea,
Vrye
went
up
to
Anna.
"What
is
it
they
write
to
you?"
he
repeated.
"I
often
think
men
have
no
understanding
of
what's
not
honorable
though
they're
always
talking
of
it,"
said
Anna,
without
answering
him.
"I've
wanted
to
tell
you
so
a
long
while,"
she
added,
and
moving
a
few
steps
away,
she
sat
down
at
a
table
in
a
corner
covered
with
albums.
"I
don't
quite
understand
the
meaning
of
your
words,"
he
said,
handing
her
the
cup.
She
glanced
towards
the
sofa
beside
her,
and
he
instantly
sat
down.
"Yes,
I
have
been
wanting
to
tell
you,"
she
said,
not
looking
at
him.

joyfully.
meeting
her
glance
and
not
dropping
his
eyes.
Not
he,
but
she,
was
confused.
"That
only
shows
you
have
no
heart,"
she
said.
But
her
eyes
said
that
she
knew
he
had
a
heart,
and
that
was
why
she
was
afraid
of
him.
"What
you
spoke
of
just
now
was
a
mistake,
and
not
love."
"Remember
that
I
have
forbidden
you
to
utter
that
word,
that
hateful
word,"
said
Anna,
with
a
shudder.
But
at
once
she
felt
that
by
that
very
word
"force
she
had
shown
that
she
acknowledged
certain
rights
over
him,
and
by
that
very
fact
was
encouraging
him
to
speak
of
love.
"I
have
long
meant
to
tell
you
this,"
she
went
on,
looking
resolutely
into
his
eyes,
and
hot
all
over
from
the
burning
flush
on
her
cheeks.
"I've
come
on
purpose
this
evening,
knowing
I
should
meet
you.
I
have
come
to
tell
you
that
this
must
end.
I
have
never
blushed
before
anyone,
and
you
force
me
to
feel
to
blame
for
something."
He
looked
at
her
and
was
struck
by
a
new
spiritual
beauty
in
her
face.
"What
do
you
wish
of
me?"
he
said
simply
and
seriously.
"I
want
you
to
go
to
Moscow
and
ask
for
Kitty,
forgiveness,"
she
said.
"You
don't
wish
that?"
he
said.
He
saw
she
was
saying
what
she
forced
herself
to
say,
not
what
she
wanted
to
say.
"If
you
love
me,
as
you
say,"
she
whispered.
"do
so
that
I
may
be
at
peace."
His
face
grew
radiantly
"Don't
you
know
that
you're
all
my
life
to
me?
But
I
know
no
peace,
and
I
can't
give
it
to
you;

myself.

I
can't

for

I
see

of

I
see
a
chance

Can
it
be
there's
no
chance
of
it?"
he
murmured
with
his
lips;
but
she
heard.
She
strained
every
effort
of
her
mind
to
say
what
ought
to
be
said.
But
instead
of
that
she
let
her
eyes
rest
on
him,
full
of
love,
and
made
no
answer.
"It's
come"
he
thought
in
ecstasy.
"When
I
was
beginning
to
despair,
and
it
seemed
there
would
be
no
end-1979

She
loves
me!
She
owns
it!"
"Then
do
this
for
me:
never
say
such
things
to
me,
and
let
us
be
friends,"
she
said
in
words;
but
her
eyes
spoke
quite
differently.
"Friends
we
shall
never
be,
you
know
that
yourself.
Whether
we
shall
be
the
happiest
or
the
wretchedly
of
people-and
in
your
hands."
She
would
have
said
something,
but
he
interrupted
her.
"I
ask
one
thing
only:
I
ask
for
the
right
to
hope,
to
suffer
as
I
do.
But
if
even
that
cannot
be,
command
me
to
disappear,
and
I
disappear.
You
shall
not
see
me
if
my
presence
is
distasteful
to
you."
"I
don't
want
to
drive
you
away."
"Only
don't
change
anything,
leave
everything
as
it
is,"
he
said
in
a
shaky
voice.
"Here's
your
husband."
At
that
instant
Alexey
Alexei
did
in
fact
walk
into
the
room
with
his
calm,
awkward
gait.
Glancing
at
his
wife
and
Vrye
he
went
up
to
the
lady
of
the
house,
and
sitting
down
for
a
cup
of
tea,
began
talking
in
his
deliberate,
always
audible
voice,
in
his
habitual
tone
of
banter,
ridiculing
someone.
"Your
Rambouillet,
is
in
full
conclaves

said,
looking
round
at
all
the
party;
"the

and

But
Princess
Betsy
could
not
endure
that
tone
of
his-and-hers
as
she
called
it,
using
the
English
word,
and
like
a
skillful
hostess
she
at
once
brought
him
into
a
serious
conversation
on
the
subject
of
universal
conscription.
Alexey
Alexei
was
immediately
interested
in
the
subject,
and
began
seriously
defending
the
new
imperial
decree
against
Princess
Betsy,
who
had
attacked
it.
Vrye
and
Anna
still
sat
at
the
little
table.
"This

whispered
one
lady,
with
an
expressive
glance
at
Madame
Karennis
Vrye
and
her
husband.
"What
did
I
tell
you?"
said
Anna's
friend.
But
not
only
those
ladies,
almost
everyone
in
the
room,
even
the
Princess
Myanmar
and
Betsy
herself,
looked
several
times
in
the
direction
of
the
two
who
had
withdrawn
from
the
general
circle,
as
though
that
were
a
disturbing
fact.
Alexey
Alexei
was
the
only
person
who
did
not
once
look
in
that
direction,
and
was
not
diverted
from
the
interesting
discussion
he
had
entered
upon.
Noticing
the
disagreeable
impression
that
was
being
made
on
everyone,
Princess
Betsy
slipped
someone
else
into
her
place
to
listen
to
Alexey
Alexei
and
went
up
to
Anna.
"I'm
always
amazed
at
the
clears
and
precision
of
your
husband's
language,"
she
said.
"The
most
transcendental
ideas
seem
to
be
within
my
grasp
when
he's
speaking."
"Oh,
yes!"
said
Anna,
radiant
with
a
smile
of
happiness,
and
not
understanding
a
word
of
what
Betsy
had
said.
She
crossed
over
to
the
big
table
and
took
part
in
the
general
conversation.
Alexey
Alexei
after
staying
half
an
hour,
went
up
to
his
wife
and
suggested
that
they
should
go
home
together.
But
she
answered,
not
looking
at
him,
that
she
was
staying
to
supper.
Alexey
Alexei
made
his
bows
and
withdrew.
The
fat
old

to

murmured
as
he
escorted

down.
"You've

was
saying?

repeated
slowly,

unhooked

gave
him
her

with

she
passed
by

vanished

Her
glance,
the
touch

her

set
him
aflame.
He
kissed
the
palm
of
his

she
had
touched

went

in
the
sense

Chapter
8
Alexey
Alexei
had
seen
nothing
striking
or
improper
in
the
fact
that
his
wife
was
sitting
with
Vrye
at
a
table
apart,
in
eager
conversation
with
him
about
something.
But
he
noticed
that
to
the
rest
of
the
party
this
appeared
something
striking
and
improper,
and
for
that
reason
it
seemed
to
him
too
to
be
improper.
He
made
up
his
mind
that
he
must
speak
of
it
to
his
wife.
On
reaching
home
Alexey
Alexei
went
to
his
study,
as
he
usually
did,
seated
himself
in
his
low
chair,
opened
a
book
on
the
Papadatos'
at
the
place
where
he
had
laid
the
paper-look
in
it,
and
read
till
one
o'clock,
just
as
he
usually
did.
But
from
time
to
time
he
rubbed
his
high
forehead
and
shook
his
head,
as
though
to
drive
away
something.
At
his
usual
time
he
got
up
and
made
his
toilet
for
the
night.
Anna
Arkalyk
had
not
yet
come
in.
With
a
book
under
his
arm
he
went
upstairs.
But
this
evening,
instead
of
his
usual
thoughts
and
meditations
upon
official
details,
his
thoughts
were
absorbed
by
his
wife
and
something
disagreeable
connected
with
her.
Contrary
to
his
usual
habit,
he
did
not
get
into
bed,
but
fell
to
walking
up
and
down
the
rooms
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back.
He
could
not
go
to
bed,
feeling
that
it
was
absolutely
needier
for
him
first
to
think
thoroughly
over
the
position
that
had
just
arisen.
When
Alexey
Alexei
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
must
talk
to
his
wife
about
it,
it
had
seemed
a
very
easy
and
simple
matter.
But
now,
when
he
began
to
think
over
the
question
that
had
just
presented
itself,
it
seemed
to
him
very
complicated
and
difficult.
Alexey
Alexei
was
not
jealous.
Jealousy
according
to
his
notions
was
an
insult
to
one's
wife,
and
one
ought
to
have
confidence
in
one's
wife.
Why
one
ought
to
have
confidence-boost
is
to
say,
complete
conviction
that
his
young
wife
would
always
love
him-her
did
not
ask
himself.
But
he
had
no
experience
of
lack
of
confidence,
because
he
had
confidence
in
her,
and
told
himself
that
he
ought
to
have
it.
Now,
though
his
conviction
that
jealousy
was
a
shameful
feeling
and
that
one
ought
to
feel
confidence,
had
not
broken
down,
he
felt
that
he
was
standing
face
to
face
with
something
illogical
and
irrational,
and
did
not
know
what
was
to
be
done.
Alexey
Alexei
was
standing
face
to
face
with
life,
with
the
possibility
of
his
wife's
loving
someone
other
than
himself,
and
this
seemed
to
him
very
irrational
and
incomprehensible
because
it
was
life
itself.
All
his
life
Alexey
Alexei
had
lived
and
worked
in
official
spheres,
having
to
do
with
the
reflection
of
life.
And
every
time
he
had
stumbled
against
life
itself
he
had
shrunk
away
from
it.
Now
he
experienced
a
feeling
akin
to
that
of
a
man
who,
while
calmly
crossing
a
precipice,
by
a
bridge,
should
suddenly
discover
that
the
bridge
is
broken,
and
that
there
is
a
chasm
below.
That
chasm
was
life
itself,
the
bridge
that
artificial
life
in
which
Alexey
Alexei
had
lived.
For
the
first
time
the
question
presented
itself
to
him
of
the
possibility
of
his
wife's
loving
someone
else,
and
he
was
horrified
at
it.
He
did
not
undress.
but
walked
up
and
down
with
his
regular
tread
over
the
resounding
parquet
of
the
dining
room,
where
one
lamp
was
burning,
over
the
carpet
of
the
dark
drawing
room,
in
which
the
light
was
reflected
on
the
big
new
portrait
of
himself
hanging
over
the
sofa,
and
across
her
boudoir,
where
two
candles
burned,
lighting
up
the
portraits
of
her
parents
and
woman
friends,
and
the
pretty
knick-knacks
of
her
writing
table,
that
he
knew
so
well.
He
walked
across
her
boudoir
to
the
bedroom
door,
and
turned
back
again.
At
each
turn
in
his
walk,
especially
at
the
parquet
of
the
lighted
dining
room,
he
halted
and
said
to
himself,
"Yes,
this
I
must
decide
and
put
a
stop
to;
I
must
express
my
view
of
it
and
my
decision."
And
he
turned
back
again.
"But
express
what-ifs."
decision?"
he
said
to
himself
in
the
drawing
room,
and
he
found
no
reply.
"But
after
all,"
he
asked
himself
before
turning
into
the
boudoir,
"what
has
occurred?
Nothing.
She
was
talking
a
long
while
with
him.
But
what
of
that?
Surely
women
in
society
can
talk
to
whom
they
please.
And
then,
jealousy
means
lowering
both
myself
and
her,"
he
told
himself
as
he
went
into
her
boudoirs
but
this
dictum,
which
had
always
had
such
weight
with
him
before,
had
now
no
weight
and
no
meaning
at
all.
And
from
the
bedroom
door
he
turned
back
again;
but
as
he
entered
the
dark
drawing
room
some
inner
voice
told
him
that
it
was
not
so,
and
that
if
others
noticed
it
that
showed
that
there
was
something.
And
he
said
to
himself
again
in
the
dining
room,
"Yes,
I
must
decide
and
put
a
stop
to
it,
and
express
my
view
of
it:
And
again
at
the
turn
in
the
drawing
room
he
asked
himself,
"Decisions
howdy
And
again
he
asked
himself,
"What
had
occurred?"
and
answered,
"Nothing,"
and
recollection
that
jealousy
was
a
feeling
insulting
to
his
wife;
but
again
in
the
drawing
room
he
was
convinced
that
something
had
happened.
His
thoughts,
like
his
body,
went
round
a
complete
circle,
without
coming
upon
anything
new.
He
noticed
this,
rubbed
his
forehead,
and
sat
down
in
her
boudoir.
There,
looking
at
her
table,
with
the
malachite
blotting
case
lying
at
the
top
and
an
unfinished
letter,
his
thoughts
suddenly
changed.
He
began
to
think
of
her,
of
what
she
was
thinking
and
feeling.
For
the
first
time
he
pictured
vividly
to
himself
her
personal
life,
her
ideas,
her
desires,
and
the
idea
that
she
could
and
should
have
a
separate
life
of
her
own
seemed
to
him
so
alarming
that
he
made
haste
to
dispel
it.
It
was
the
chasm
which
he
was
afraid
to
peep
into.
To
put
himself
in
thought
and
feeling
in
another
person's
place
was
a
spiritual
exercise
not
natural
to
Alexey
Alexei
He
looked
on
this
spiritual
exercise
as
a
harmful
and
dangerous
abuse
of
the
fancy.
"And
the
worst
of
it
all,"
thought
he,
"is
that
just
now,
at
the
very
moment
when
my
great
work
is
approaching
completion,
(he
was
thinking
of
the
project
he
was
bringing
forward
at
the
time),
"when
I
stand
in
need
of
all
my
mental
peace
and
all
my
energies,
just
now
this
stupid
worry
should
fall
foul
of
me.
But
what's
to
be
done?
I'm
not
one
of
those
men
who
submit
to
uneasiness
and
worry
without
having
the
force
of
character
to
face
them.
"I
must
think
it
over,
come
to
a
decision,
and
put
it
out
of
my
mind,"
he
said
aloud.
"The
question
of
her
feelings,
of
what
has
passed
and
may
be
passing
in
her
soul,
that's
not
my
affair;
that's
the
affair
of
her
conscience,
and
falls
under
the
head
of
religion,"
he
said
to
himself,
feeling
consolation
in
the
sense
that
he
had
found
to
which
division
of
regulating
principles
this
new
circumstance
could
be
properly
referred.
"And
so,"
Alexey
Alexei
said
to
himself,
"questions
as
to
her
feelings,
and
so
on,
are
questions
for
her
conscience,
with
which
I
can
have
nothing
to
do.
My
duty
is
clearly
defined.
As
the
head
of
the
family,
I
am
a
person
bound
in
duty
to
guide
her,
and
consequently,
in
part
the
person
responsible?'
I
am
bound
to
point
out
the
danger
I
perceive,"
to
warn
her,
even
to
use
my
authority.
I
ought
to
speak
plainly
to
her."
And
everything
that
he
would
say
tonight
to
his
wife
took
clear
shape
in
Alexey
Alexei
head.
Thinking
over
what
he
would
say,
he
somewhat
regretted
that
he
should
have
to
use
his
time
and
mental
powers
for
domestic
consumption,
with
so
little
to
show
for
it,
but,
in
spite
of
that,
the
form
and
contents
of
the
speech
before
him
shaped
itself
as
clearly
and
distinctly
in
his
head
as
a
ministerial
report.
"I
must
say
and
express
fully
the
following
points:
first,
exposition
of
the
value
to
be
attached
to
public
opinion
and
to
decoupage
secondly,
exposition
of
religious
significance
of
marriage;
thirdquarter
if
need
be,
reference
to
the
calamity
possibly
ensuing
to
our
son;
fourthquarter
reference
to
the
unhappiness
likely
to
result
to
herself."
And,
interlarded
his
fingers,
Alexey
Alexei
stretched
them,
and
the
joints
of
the
fingers
cracked.
This
trick,
a
bad
habit,
the
cracking
of
his
fingers,
always
soothed
him,
and
gave
precision
to
his
thoughts,
so
needier
to
him
at
this
juncture.
There
was
the
sound
of
a
carriage
driving
up
to
the
front
door.
Alexey
Alexei
halted
in
the
middle
of
the
room.
A
woman's
step
was
heard
mounting
the
stairs.
Alexey
Alexei
ready
for
his
speech,
stood
compressing
his
crossed
fingers,
waiting
to
see
if
the
crack
would
not
come
again.
One
joint
cracked.
Already,
from
the
sound
of
light
steps
on
the
stairs,
he
was
aware
that
she
was
close,
and
though
he
was
satisfied
with
his
speech,
he
felt
frightened
of
the
explanation
confronting
him:
Chapter
9
Anna
came
in
with
hanging
head,
playing
with
the
tassels
of
her
hood.
Her
face
was
brilliant
and
glowingly
but
this
glow
was
not
one
of
brights
it
suggested
the
fearful
glow
of
a
conflagration
in
the
midst
of
a
dark
night.
On
seeing
her
husband,
Anna
raised
her
head
and
smiled,
as
though
she
had
just
waked
up.
"You're
not
in
bed?"
What
a
wonder"
she
said,
letting
fall
her
hood,
and
without
stopping,
she
went
on
into
the
dressing
room.
"It's
late,
Alexey
Alexei
she
said,
when
she
had
gone
through
the
doorway.
"Anne
it's
necessary
for
me
to
have
a
talk
with
you."
"With
me?"
she
said,
wonderland
She
came
out
from
behind
the
door
of
the
dressing
room,
and
looked
at
him.
"Why,
what
is
it?
What
about?"
she
asked,
sitting
down.
"Well,
let's
talk,
if
it's
so
necessary.
But
it
would
be
better
to
get
to
sleep."
Anna
said
what
came
to
her
lips,
and
marveled,
hearing
herself,
at
her
own
capacity
for
lying.
How
simple
and
natural
were
her
words,
and
how
likely
that
she
was
simply
sleepy,
She
felt
herself
clad
in
an
impenetrable
armor
of
falsehood.
She
felt
that
some
unseen
force
had
come
to
her
aid
and
was
supporting
her.
"Anne
I
must
warn
you,"
he
began.
"Warn
me?"
she
said.
"Of
what?"
She
looked
at
him
so
simply,
so
brightly-colored
that
anyone
who
did
not
know
her
as
her
husband
knew
her
could
not
have
noticed
anything
null
either
in
the
sound
or
the
sense
of
her
words.
But
to
him,
knowing
her,
knowing
that
whenever
he
went
to
bed
five
minutes
later
than
usual,
she
noticed
it,
and
asked
him
the
reason;
to
him,
knowing
that
every
joy,
every
pleasure
and
pain
that
she
felt
she
communicated
to
him
at
once;
to
him,
now
to
see
that
she
did
not
care
to
notice
his
state
of
mind,
that
she
did
not
care
to
say
a
word
about
herself,
meant
a
great
deal.
He
saw
that
the
inn
recesses
of
her
soul,
that
had
always
hitherto
lain
open
before
him,
were
closed
against
him.
More
than
that,
he
saw
from
her
tone
that
she
was
not
even
perturbed
at
that,
but
as
it
were
said
straight
out
to
him:
"Yes,
it's
shut
up,
and
so
it
must
be,
and
will
be
in
future."
Now
he
experienced
a
feeling
such
as
a
man
might
have,
returning
home
and
finding
his
own
house
locked
up.
"But
perhaps
the
key
may
yet
be
found,"
thought
Alexey
Alexei
"I
want
to
warn
you,"
he
said
in
a
low
voice,
"that
through
thoughts
and
lack
of
caution
you
may
cause
yourself
to
be
talked
about
in
society.

too
animated
conversation

evening

enunciated
the

firmly
and
with
deliberate
emphasis).

He
talked
and
looked
at
her
laughing
eyes,
which
frightened
him
now
with
their
impenetrable
look,
and,
as
he
talked,
he
felt
all
the
uselessness.
and

his
words.
"You're
always

she
answered,

and
of
all
he
had
said
only
taking
in
the
last

"One

Alexey

and
bent
his
hands
to
make
the
joints

"Oh,
please,
don't
do
that,
I
do

dislike
it,"
she
said.
"Anne
is
this

said
Alexey
Alexei
quietly
making
an
effort
over
himself,
and
restraining
the
motion
of
his
fingers.
"But
what
is
it
all
about?"
she
said,
with
such
genuine
and
droll
wonder.
"What
do
you
want
of
me?"
Alexey
Alexei
paused,
and
rubbed
his
forehead
and
his
eyes.
He
saw
that

of

he
had
intended.

unconsciously
become
agitated
over
what
was
the
affair
of
her
conscience,

was
struggling
against
the
barrier
he
fancied

them.
"This
is
what
I
meant
to

to
you,"
he
went
on
coldly
and
composer
"and
I
beg

to
listen

she
thought.
"But

people

that's
what
upsets
him."You

Alexey
Alexei
she
added,
and
she
got
up,
and
would
have
gone
towards
the
door;
but
he
moved
forward
as
though
he
would
stop
her.
His
face
was
ugly
and
forbidding,
as
Anna
had
never
seen
him.
She
stopped,
and
bending
her
head
back
and
on
one
side,
began
with
her
rapid
hand
taking
out
her
hairs
"Well,
I'm
listening
to
what's
to
come,"
she
said,
calmly
and
ironies
"and
indeed
I
listen
with
interest,
for
I
should
like
to
understand
what's
the
matter."
She
spoke,
and
marveled
at
the
confident,
calm,
and
natural
tone
in
which
she
was
speaking,
and
the
choice
of
the
words
she
used.
"To
enter
into
all
the
details
of
your
feelings
I
have
no
right,

besides,
I
regard
that
as
useless
and

harmful,"

Alexey

dear,

said,
rapidly
passing
her
hand
through
her
hair,
feeling
for
the
remaining
hairs
"Anne
for
God's

don't
speak

he
said
gently.
"Perhaps
I
am

what
I
say,
I
say
as
much
for

as
for
you.

am

I
love

For
an
instant
her
face
fell,
and
the
mocking
gleam
in
her
eyes
died
away;
but
the
word
_may
threw
her
into
revolt
again.
She
thought:
"Loves
Can
he
love?"
If
he
hadn't
heard
there
was
such
a
thing
as
love,
he
would
never
have
used
the
word.
He
doesn't
even
know
what
love
is."
"Alias
Alexei
really
I
don't
understand,"
she
said.
"Defined
what
it
is
you
find?
"Parent
let
me
say
all
I
have
to
say.
I
love
you.
But
I
am
not
speaking
of
myself;
the
most
important
persons
in
this
matter
are
our
son
and
yourself.
It
may
very
well
be,
I
repeat,
that
my
words
seem
to
you
utterly
unnecessary
and
out
of
place;
it
may
be
that
they
are
called
forth
by
my
mistaken
impression.
In
that
case,
I
beg
you
to
forgive
me.
But
if
you
are
conscious
yourself
of
even
the
smallest
foundation
for
them,
then
I
beg
you
to
think
a
little,
and
if
your
heart
prompts
you,
to
speak
out
to
me:
Alexey
Alexei
was
unconsciously
saying
something
utterly
unlike
what
he
had
prepared.
"I
have
nothing
to
say.
And
besides.
she
said
hurries
with
difficulty
repressing
a
smile,
"it's
really
time
to
be
in
bed."
Alexey
Alexei
sighed,
and,
without
saying
more,
went
into
the
bedroom.
When
she
came
into
the
bedroom,
he
was
already
in
bed.
His
lips
were
sternly
compressed-air
and
his
eyes
looked
away
from
her.
Anna
got
into
her
bed,
and
lay
expecting
every
minute
that
he
would
begin
to
speak
to
her
again.
She
both
feared
his
speaking
and
wished
for
it.
But
he
was
silent.
She
waited
for
a
long
while
without
moving,
and
had
forgotten
about
him.
She
thought
of
that
other;
she
pictured
him,
and
felt
how
her
heart
was
flooded
with
emotion
and
guilty
delight
at
the
thought
of
him.
Suddenly
she
heard
an
even,
tranquil
snore.
For
the
first
instant
Alexey
Alexei
seemed,
as
it
were,
appalled
at
his
own
snoring,
and
ceasefire
but
after
an
interval
of
two

the
snore.
sounded
again,
with
a
new
tranquil
rhythm.
"It's
late,
it's
late,"
she
whispered
with
a
smile.
A
long
while
she
lay,
not
moving,
with
open
eyes,
whose
brilliance
she
almost
fancied
she
could
herself
see
in
the
darkness.
Chapter
10
From
that
time
a
new
life
began
for
Alexey
Alexei
and
for
his
wife.
Nothing
special
happened.
Anna
went
out
into
society,
as
she
had
always
done,
was
particularly
often
at
Princess
Betsy,
and
met
Vrye
everywhere.
Alexey
Alexei
saw
this,
but
could
do
nothing.
All
his
efforts
to
draw
her
into
open
discussion
she
confronted
with
a
barrier
which
he
could
not
penetrate.
made
up
of
a
sort
of
amused
perplexity.
Outwardly,
everything
was
the
same,
but
their
inner
relations
were
completely
changed.
Alexey
Alexei
a
man
of
great
power
in
the
world
of
politics,
felt
himself
helpless
in
this.
Like
an
ox
with
head
bent,
submissiveness
he
awaited
the
blow
which
he
felt
was
lifted
over
him.
Every
time
he
began
to
think
about
it,
he
felt
that
he
must
try
once
more,
that
by
kindness,
tenderness.
and
persuasion
there
was
still
hope
of
saving
her,
of
bringing
her
back
to
herself,
and
every
day
he
made
ready
to
talk
to
her.
But
every
time
he
began
talking
to
her,
he
felt
that
the
spirit
of
evil
and
deceit,
which
had
taken
possession
of
her,
had
possession
of
him
too,
and
he
talked
to
her
in
a
tone
quite
unlike
that
in
which
he
had
meant
to
talk.
Involuntary
he
talked
to
her
in
his
habitual
tone
of
jeering
at
anyone
who
should
say
what
he
was
saying.
And
in
that
tone
it
was
impossible
to
say
what
needed
to
be
said
to
her.
Chapter
11
That
which
for
Vrye
had
been
almost
a
whole
year
the
one
absorbing
desire
of
his
life,
replacing
all
his
old
desires?
that
which
for
Anna
had
been
an
impossible,
terrible,
and
even
for
that
reason
more
entrancing.
dream
of
bliss.
that
desire
had
been
fulfilled.
He
stood
before
her,
pale,
his
lower
jaw
quivering,
and
bespangled
her
to
be
calm,
not
knowing
how
or
why.
"Anne
Anna's
he
said
with
a
choking
voice,
"Anne
for
pity,
sake"
But
the
louder
he
spoke,
the
lower
she
dropped
her
once
proud
and
gay,
now
shame.
head,
and
she
bowed
down
and
sank
from
the
sofa
where
she
was
sitting,
down
on
the
floor,
at
his
feet;
she
would
have
fallen
on
the
carpet
if
he
had
not
held
her.
"My
God!
Forgive
me!"
she
said,
sobbing,
pressing
his
hands
to
her
bosom.
She
felt
so
null
so
guilty,
that
nothing
was
left
her
but
to
humiliate
herself
and
beg
forgiveness?"
and
as
now
there
was
no
one
in
her
life
but
him,
to
him
she
addressed
her
prayer
for
forgiveness.
Looking
at
him,
she
had
a
physical
sense
of
her
humiliation,
and
she
could
say
nothing
more.
He
felt
what
a
murderer
must
feel,
when
he
sees
the
body
he
has
robbed
of
life.
That
body,
robbed
by
him
of
life,
was
their
love,
the
first
stage
of
their
love.
There
was
something
awful
and
revolting
in
the
memory
of
what
had
been
bought
at
this
fearful
price
of
shame.
Shame
at
their
spiritual
nakedness
crushed
her
and
infected
him.
But
in
spite
of
all
the
murderer's
horror
before
the
body
of
his
victim,
he
must
hack
it
to
pieces,
hide
the
body,
must
use
what
he
has
gained
by
his
murder.
And
with
fury,"
as
it
were
with
passion,
the
murderer
falls
on
the
body,
and
drags
it
and
hacks
at
it;
so
he
covered
her
face
and
shoulders
with
kisses.
She
held
his
hand,
and
did
not
stir.
"Yes,
these
kisses.
is
what
has
been
bought
by
this
shame.
Yes,
and
one
hand,
which
will
always
be
mine-clearing
hand
of
my
accomplices
She
lifted
up
that
hand
and
kissed
it.
He
sank
on
his
knees
and
tried
to
see
her
face;
but
she
hid
it,
and
said
nothing.
At
last,
as
though
making
an
effort
over
herself,
she
got
up
and
pushed
him
away.
Her
face
was
still
as
beautiful,
but
it
was
only
the
more
pitiful
for
that.
"All
is
over,"
she
said;
"I
have
nothing
but
you.
Remember
that."
"I
can
never
forget
what
is
my
whole
life.
For
one
instant
of
this
happoiness
"Happiness,"
she
said
with
horror
and
loathing
and
her
horror
unconsciously
infected
him.
"For
pity,
sake,
not
a
word,
not
a
word
more."
She
rose
quickly
and
moved
away
from
him.
"Not
a
word
more,"
she
repeated,
and
with
a
look
of
chill
despair,
incomprehensible
to
him,
she
parted
from
him.
She
felt
that
at
that
moment
she
could
not
put
into
words
the
sense
of
shame,
of
rapture.
and
of
horror
at
this
stepping
into
a
new
life,
and
she
did
not
want
to
speak
of
it,
to
vulgarly
this
feeling
by
inappropriate
words.
But
later
too,
and
the
next
day
and
the
third
day,
she
still
found
no
words
in
which
she
could
express
the
complexity
of
her
feelings;
indeed,
she
could
not
even
find
thoughts
in
which
she
could
clearly
think
out
all
that
was
in
her
soul.
She
said
to
herself:
"No,
just
now
I
can't
think
of
it,
later
on,
when
I
am
calmest
But
this
calm
for
thought
never
came?
every
time
the
thought
rose
of
what
she
had
done
and
what
would
happen
to
her,
and
what
she
ought
to
do,
a
horror
came
over
her
and
she
drove
those
thoughts
away.
"Later,
later,"
she
said.
I
am
calmest
But
in
dreams,
when
she
had
no
control
over
her
thoughts,
her
position
presented
itself
to
her
in
all
its
hideous
naltrexone,
One
dream
haunted
her
almost
every
night.
She
dreamed
that
both
were
her
husbands
at
once,
that
both
were
lavishing
caresses.
on
her.
Alexey
Alexei
was
weeping,
kissing
her
hands,
and
saying,
"How
happy
we
are
now!"
And
Alexey
Vrye
was
there
too,
and
he
too
was
her
husband.
And
she
was
marveling
that
it
had
once
seemed
impossible
to
her,
was
explaining
to
them,
laughing,
that
this
was
ever
so
much
simpler,
and
that
now
both
of
them
were
happy
and
contented.
But
this
dream
weighed
on
her
like
a
nightmare,
and
she
awoke
from
it
in
terror.
Chapter
12
In
the
early
days
after
his
return
from
Moscow,
whenever
Levin
shuddered
and
grew
red,
remembering
the
disgrace
of
his
rejection,
he
said
to
himself:
"This
was
just
how
I
used
to
shudder
and
blush,
thinking
myself
utterly
lost,
when
I
was
plucked
in
physics
and
did
not
get
my
removed
and
how
I
thought
myself
utterly
ruined
after
I
had
mismanaged
that
affair
of
my
sister's
that
was
entrusted
to
me.
And
yet,
now
that
years
have
passed,
I
recall
it
and
wonder
that
it
could
distress
me
so
much.
It
will
be
the
same
thing
too
with
this
trouble.
Time
will
go
by
and
I
shall
not
mind
about
this
either."
But
three
months
had
passed
and
he
had
not
left
off
minding
about
it;
and
it
was
as
painful
for
him
to
think
of
it
as
it
had
been
those
first
days.
He
could
not
be
at
peace
because
after
dreaming
so
long
of
family
life,
and
feeling
himself
so
ripe
for
it,
he
was
still
not
married,
and
was
further
than
ever
from
marriage.
He
was
painfully
conscious
himself,
as
were
all
about
him,
that
at
his
years
it
is
not
well
for
man
to
be
alone.
He
remembered
how
before
starting
for
Moscow
he
had
once
said
to
his
coworkers
Nikolay,
a
simple-living
peasant,
whom
he
liked
talking
to:
"Well,
Nikolay,
I
mean
to
get
married,"
and
how
Nikolay
had
promptly
answered,
as
of
a
matter
on
which
there
could
be
no
possible
doubt:
"And
high
time
too,
Konstantin
Demjanjuk
But
marriage
had
now
become
further
off
than
ever.
The
place
was
taken,
and
whenever
he
tried
to
imagine
any
of
the
girls
he
knew
in
that
place,
he
felt
that
it
was
utterly
impossible.
Moreover,
the
recollection
of
the
rejection
and
the
part
he
had
played
in
the
affair
tortured
him
with
shame.
However
often
he
told
himself
that
he
was
in
no
wise
to
blame
in
it,
that
recollection,"
like
other
humiliating
reminiscences
of
a
similar
kind,
made
him
twinge
and
blush.
There
had
been
in
his
past,
as
in
every
man's,
actions,
recognized
by
him
as
bad,
for
which
his
conscience
ought
to
have
tormented
him;
but
the
memory
of
these
evil
actions
was
far
from
causing
him
so
much
suffering
as
those
trivial
but
humiliating
reminiscences.
These
wounds
never
healed.
And
with
these
memories
was
now
ranged
his
rejection
and
the
pitiful
position
in
which
he
must
have
appeared
to
others
that
evening.
But
time
and
work
did
their
part.
Bitter
memories
were
more
and
more
covered
up
by
the
incidents.
in
his
eyes,
but
really
important-looking
his
country
life.
Every
week
he
thought
less
often
of
Kitty.
He
was
impatiently
looking
forward
to
the
news
that
she
was
married,
or
just
going
to
be
married,
hoping
that
such
news
would,
like
having
a
tooth
out,
completely
cure
him.
Meanwhile
spring
came
on,
beautiful
and
kindly,
without
the
delays
and
treacherous
of
spring-
of
those
rare
springs
in
which
plants,
beasts,
and
man
rejoice
alike.
This
lovely
spring
roused
Levin
still
more,
and
strengthened
him
in
his
resolution
of
renouncing
all
his
past
and
building
up
his
lonely
life
firmly
and
independently.
Though
many
of
the
plans
with
which
he
had
returned
to
the
country
had
not
been
carried
out,
still
his
most
important
resolution.
of
purity.
been
kept
by
him.
He
was
free
from
that
shame,
which
had
usually
harassed
him
after
a
fall;
and
he
could
look
everyone
straight
in
the
face.
In
February
he
had
received
a
letter
from
Maryam
Nikolai
telling
him
that
his
brother
Nikolay,
health
was
getting
worse,
but
that
he
would
not
take
advice,
and
in
consequence
of
this
letter
Levin
went
to
Moscow
to
his
brother's
and
succeeded
in
persuading
him
to
see
a
doctor
and
to
go
to
a
watering.
abroad.
He
succeeded
so
well
in
persuading
his
brother,
and
in
lending
him
money
for
the
journey
without
irritating
him,
that
he
was
satisfied
with
himself
in
that
matter.
In
addition
to
his
farming,
which
called
for
special
attention
in
spring,
and
in
addition
to
reading,
Levin
had
begun
that
winter
a
work
on
agriculture,
the
plan
of
which
turned
on
taking
into
account
the
character
of
the
laborer
on
the
land
as
one
of
the
unalterable
data
of
the
question,
like
the
climate
and
the
soil,
and
consequently
deduct
all
the
principles
of
scientific
culture,
not
simply
from
the
data
of
soil
and
climate,
but
from
the
data
of
soil,
climate,
and
a
certain
unalterable
character
of
the
laborer.
Thus,
in
spite
of
his
solitude,
or
in
consequence
of
his
solitude,
his
life
was
exceedingly
full.
Only
rarely
he
suffered
from
an
unsatisfied
desire
to
communicate
his
stray
ideas
to
someone
besides
Agag
Mihalowski
With
her
indeed
he
not
infrequently
fell
into
discussion
upon
physics,
the
theory
of
agriculture,
and
especially
philosophy;
philosophy
was
Agag
Mihalowski
favorite
subject.
Spring
was
slow
in
unfolding.
For
the
last
few
weeks
it
had
been
steadily
fine
frosty
weather.
In
the
daytime
it
thawed
in
the
sun,
but
at
night
there
were
even
seven
degrees
of
frost.
There
was
such
a
frozen
surface
on
the
snow
that
they
drove
the
wagons
anywhere
off
the
roads.
Easter
came
in
the
snow.
Then
all
of
a
sudden,
on
Easter
Monday,
a
warm
wind
sprang
up,
storm
clouds
swooped
down,
and
for
three
days
and
three
nights
the
warm,
driving
rain
fell
in
streams.
On
Thursday
the
wind
dropped,
and
a
thick
gray
fog
brooded
over
the
land
as
though
hiding
the
mysteries
of
the
transformations
that
were
being
wrought
in
nature.
Behind
the
fog
there
was
the
flowing
of
water,
the
cracking
and
floating
of
ice,
the
swift
rush
of
turbidites,
foaming
torrid
and
on
the
following
Monday,
in
the
evening,
the
fog
parted,
the
storm
clouds
split
up
into
little
curling
crests

cloud,
the
sky
cleared,
and
the
real
spring
had
come.
In
the
morning
the
sun
rose
brilliant
and
quickly
wore
away
the
thin
layer
of
ice
that
covered
the
water,
and
all
the
warm
air
was
quivering
with
the
steam
that
rose
up
from
the
quickened
earth.
The
old
grass
looked
greenery
and
the
young
grass
thrust
up
its
tiny
blading,
the
buds
of
the
gueridons
and
of
the
currant
and
the
sticky
birch-fringed
were
swollen
with

and

was
humming
about

Chapter
13
Levin
put
on
his
big
boots,
and,
for
the
first
time,
a
cloth
jacket,
instead
of
his
fur
cloak,"
and
went
out
to
look
after
his
farm,
stepping
over
streams
of
water
that
flashed
in
the
sunshine
and
dazzled
his
eyes,
and
treading
one
minute
on
ice
and
the
next
into
sticky
mud.
Spring
is
the
time
of
plans
and
projects.
And,
as
he
came
out
into
the
farmyard,
Levin,
like
a
tree
in
spring
that
knows
not
what
form
will
be
taken
by
the
young
shoots
and
twigs
imprisoned
in
its
swelling
buds,
hardly
knew
what
undertakings
he
was
going
to
begin
upon
now
in
the
farm
work
that
was
so
dear
to
him.
But
he
felt
that
he
was
full
of
the
most
splendid
plans
and
projects.
First
of
all
he
went
to
the
cattle.
The
cows
had
been
let
out
into
their
paddocks.
and
their
smooth
sides
were
already
shining
with
their
new,
sleek,
spring
coattail
they
basked
in
the
sunshine
and
lower
to
go
to
the
meadowlark
Levin
gazed
admiringly
at
the
cows
he
knew
so
intimately
to
the
minutest
detail
of
their
condition,
and
gave
orders
for
them
to
be
driven
out
into
the
meadow,
and
the
calves
to
be
let
into
the
paddocks.
The
herdsman
ran
gaily
to
get
ready
for
the
meadowlark
The
cowhide
girls,
picking
up
their
petticoats,
ran
splashing
through
the
mud
with
bare
legs,
still
white,
not
yet
brown
from
the
sun,
waving
brush

in
their
hands,
chasing
the
calves
that
frolicked
in
the
mirth
of
spring.
After
admiring
the
young
ones
of
that
year,

were

gave
orders
for
a
trough
to
be
brought
out
and
for
them
to
be
fed
in
the
paddocks.
But
it
appeared
that
as
the
paddock
had
not
been
used
during
the
winter,
the
hurdles
made
in
the
autumn
for
it
were
broken.
He
sent
for
the
carpenter,
who,
according
to
his
orders,
ought
to
have
been
at
work
at
the
thrashing
machine.
But
it
appeared
that
the
carpenter
was
repairing
the
harrumph
which
ought
to
have
been
repaired
before
Lent.
This
was
very
annoying
to
Levin.
It
was
annoying
to
come
upon
that
everlasting
slovenly
in
the
farm
work
against
which
he
had
been
striving
with
all
his
might
for
so
many
years.
The
hurdles,
as
he
ascertains
being
not
wanted
in
winter,
had
been
carried
to
the
cart.

and
there
broken,
as
they
were
of
light
construction,
only
meant
for
feeding
calves.
Moreover,
it
was
apparent
also
that
the
harrumph
and
all
the
agricultural
implements,
which
he
had
directed
to
be
looked
over
and
repaired
in
the
winter,
for
which
very
purpose
he
had
hired
three
carpenters,
had
not
been
put
into
repair,
and
the
harrumph
were
being
repaired
when
they
ought
to
have
been
harrowing
the
field.
Levin
sent
for
his
bailiff,
but
immediately
went
off
himself
to
look
for
him.
The
bailiff,
beaming
all
over,
like
everyone
that
day,
in
a
sheepskin
bordered
with
astraddle
came
out
of
the
barn,
twisting
a
bit
of
straw
in
his
hands.
"Why
isn't
the
carpenter
at
the
thrashing
machined
"Oh,
I
meant
to
tell
you
yesterday,

Here
it's
time
they
got
to
work
in

fields."
"But
what
were
they
doing
in
the
winter,
then?"
"But
what
did
you
want
the
carpenter
for?"
"Where
are
the
hurdles
for
the
calves,
paddocks.
"I
ordered
them
to
be
got
ready.
What
would
you
have
with
those
peasants'
said
the
bailiff,
with
a
wave
of
his
hand.
"It's
not
those
peasants
but
this
bailiff's
said
Levin,
getting
angry.
"Why,
what
do
I
keep
you
for?"
he
cried.
But,
null
himself
that
this
would
not
help
matters,
he
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence,
and
merely
sighed.
"Well,
what
do
you
say?
Can
sowing
begin?"
he
asked,
after
a
pause.
"Behind
Turkington
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
they
might
begin."
"And
the

"I've
sent
Vassily
and
Mishkan

I
don't
know
if
they'll

to

so

"How

"About

"Why
not

cried
Levin.
That

were
only

acres,
not
on
all
the
forty.
was
still
more
annoying
to
him.
Clover-Mist
as
he
knew,
both
from
books
and
from
his
own
experience,
never
did
well
except
when
it
was
sown
as
early
as
possible,
almost
in
the
snow.
And
yet
Levin
could
never
get
this
done.
"There's
no
one
to
send.
What
would
you
have

such
a

that

were
already
ruined.
Again
they
had
not
done
as
he
had
ordered.
"Why,
but
I
told
you
during
Lent
to
put
in
pipes.
he
cried.
"Don't
put
yourself
out;
we
shall
get
it
all
done
in
time."
Levin
waved
his
hand
angrily,
went
into
the
granary,
to
glance
at
the
oats,
and
then
to
the
stable.
The
oats
were
not
yet
spoiled.
But
the
peasants
were
carrying
the
oats
in
spades
when
they
might
simply
let
them
slide
down
into
the
lower
grand
and
arranging
for
this
to
be
done,
and
taking
two
workmen
from
there
for

Levin
got
over
his
vexatious
with
the
bailiffs
Indeed,
it
was
such
a
lovely
day
that
one
could
not
be
angry.

called
to
the
coachman,
who,
with

tucked
up,
was

"Whichever

"Well,

Kolsaas
"Yes,
sir."
While
they
were
saddling
his
horse,
Levin
again
called
up
the
bailiff,
who
was
hanging
about
in
sight,
to
make
it
up
with
him,
and
began
talking
to
him
about
the
spring
operations
before
them,
and
his
plans
for
the
farm.
The
wagons
were
to
begin
carting
manure
earlier,
so
as
to
get
all
done
before
the
early
mowing.
And
the
ploughing
of
the

go
on
without
a
break
so
as
to
let
it
ripen

fallow.
And
the
mowing
to
be
all
done
by
hired
labor,
not
on
half-quart
The
bailiff
listened
attentively,
and
obviously
made
an
effort
to
approve
of
his
employer's
projects.
But
still
he
had
that
look
Levin
knew
so
well
that
always
irritated
him,
a
look
of
hopelessness
and
despondency.
That
look
said:
"That's
all

Levin
so
much
as
that
tone.
But
it
was
the
tone
common
to
all
the
bailiffs
he
had
ever
had.
They
had
all
taken
up
that
attitude
to
his
plans,
and
so
now
he
was
not
angered
by
it,
but
mortified.
and
felt
all
the
more
roused
to
struggle
against
this,
as
it
seemed,
elemental
force
continually
ranged
against
him,
for
which
he
could
find
no
other
expression
than
"as

"If
we
can
manage
it,
Konstantin
Dmitrin
said
the
bailiffs
"Why
ever
shouldn't
you

"We
positively
must
have
another
fifteen
laborers.
And
they
don't
turn
up.
There
were
some
here
today
asking
seventy
roubles
for
the
summer."
Levin
was
silent.
Again
he
was
brought
face
to
face
with
that
opposing
force.
He
knew
that
however
much
they
tried,
they
could
not
hire
more
than
forty-five
perhaps
or
thirty-minute
for
a
reasonable
sum.
Some
forty
had
been
taken
on,
and
there
were
no
more.
But
still
he
could
not
help
struggling
against
it.
"Send

they

"But
there
are
the
horses,
too,
they're
not

for
much."
"We'll
get
some
more.
I
know,
of
course,"
Levin
added
laughing,
"you
always
want
to
do
with
as
little
and
as

quality
as
possible;
but
this

I'm
not

shouted.
"All
right,
I'll
go
by

And
Levin
rode
through
the
slush
of
the
farmyard
to
the
gate
and
out
into
the
open
country,
his
good
little
horse,
after
his
long
inactivity,
stepping
out

snorting
over
the
pools,
and
asking,
as
it
were,
for
guidance.
If
Levin
had
felt
happy
before
in
the
cattle
pens
and
farmyard,
he
felt
happier
yet
in
the
open
country.
Swayne
rhythmically
with
the
ambling
paces
of
his
good
little
cob,
drinking
in
the
warm
yet
fresh
scent
of
the
snow
and
the
air,
as
he
rode
through
his
forest
over
the
crumbling,
wasted
snow,
still
left
in
parts,
and
covered
with
dissolving
tracks,
he
rejoiced
over
every
tree,
with
the
moss
reviving
on
its
bark
and
the
buds
swelling
on
its
shoots.
When
he
came
out
of
the
forest,
in
the
immense
plain
before
him,
his
grass
fields
stretched
in
an
unbroken
carpet
of
green,
without
one
bare
place
or
swamp,
only
spotted
here
and
there
in
the
hollows
with
patches
of
melting
snow.
He
was
not
put
out
of
temper
even
by
the
sight
of
the
peasants'
horses
and
columbarium,
trampling
down
his
young
grass
(he
told
a
peasant
he
met
to
drive
them
out).
nor
by
the
sarcastic
and
stupid
reply
of
the
peasant
Ipco
whom
he
met
on
the
way,
and
asked,
"Well,

shall
we
soon
be
sown
"We
must
get
the
ploughing
done
first,
Konstantin
Dmitrin
answered
Ipco
The
further
he
rode,
the
happier
he
became,
and
plans
for
the
land
rose
to
his
mind
each
better
than
the
last;
to
plant
all
his
fields
with
hedges
along
the
southern
borders,
so
that
the
snow
should
not
lie
under
them;
to
divide
them
up
into
six
fields
of
arable
and
three
of
pasture
and
haying
to
build
a
cattle
yard
at
the
further
end
of
the
estate,
and
to
dig
a
pond
and
to
construct
movable
pens
for
the
cattle
as
a
means
of
manuscript
the
land.
And
then
eight
hundred
acres
of
wheat,
three
hundred
of
potatoes,
and
four
hundred
of
clover,"
and
not
one
acre
exhausted.
Absorbed
in
such
dreams,
carefully
keeping
his
horse
by
the
hedges,
so
as
not
to
trample
his
young
crops,
he
rode
up
to
the
laborers
who
had
been
sent
to
sow
clover.
A
cart
with
the
seed
in
it
was
standing,
not
at
the
edge,
but
in
the
middle
of
the
crop,
and
the
winter
corn
had
been
torn
up
by
the
wheels
and
trampled
by
the
horse.
Both
the
laborers
were
sitting
in
the
hedge,
probably
smoking
a
pipe
together.
The
earth
in
the
cart,
with
which
the
seed
was
mixed,
was
not
crushed
to
powder,
but
crustiest,
together
or
adhering
in

Seeing
the
master,
the
laborer,
Vassmer's,
went
towards
the
cart,
while
Mishkan
set
to
work
sowing.
This
was
not
as
it
should
be,
but
with
the
laborers
Levin
seldom
lost
his
temper.
When
Vassily
came
up,
Levin
told
him
to
lead
the
horse
to
the
hedge.
"It's
all
right,
sir,
it'll
spring
up
again,"
responded
Vassmer's,
"Please
don't
argue.
said
Levin,
"but
do
as
you're
told."
"Yes,
sir,"
answered
Vassmer's,
and
he
took
the
horse's
head.
"What
a

he
said,

said
Levin.
"Well,
we
crumble
it
up,"
answered
Vassmer's,
taking
up
some
seed
and
rolling
the
earth
in
his
palms.
Vassily
was
not
to
blame
for
their
having
filled
up
his
cart
with
unsightly
earth,
but
still
it
was
annoying.
Levin
had
more
than
once
already
tried
a
way
he
knew
for
stifling
his
anger,
and
turning
all
that
seemed
dark
right
again,
and
he
tried
that
way
now.
He
watched
how
Mishkan
strode
along,
swinging
the
huge
clods
of
earth
that
clung
to
each
foot;
and
getting
off
his
horse,
he
took
the
sieve
from
Vassily
and
started
sowing
himself.
"Where
did
you
stop?"
Vassily
pointed
to
the
mark
with
his
foot,
and
Levin
went
forward
as
best
he
could,
scattering
the
seed
on
the
land.
Walking
was
as
difficult
as
on
a
bogey
and
by
the
time
Levin
had
ended
the
row
he
was
in
a
great
heat,
and
he
stopped
and
gave
up
the
sieve
to
Vassmer's,
"Well,
master,
when
summer's
here,
mind
you
don't
scold
me
for
these
rows.

Vassmer's,

feeling
the
effect
of
his
method.
"Why,
you'll
see
in
the

It'll
look

where
I
sowed

spring.

at

said
Vassmer's,
pointing,
"it
does
one's

good."
"It's
a
lovely
spring,
Vassmer's,
"Why,
it's
a
spring
such
as
the
old
men
don't
remember
the
like
of.
I
was
up
home;
an
old
man
up
there
has
sown
wheat
too,
about
an
acre
of
it.
He
was
saying
you
wouldn't
know
it
from

"Have
you
been
sowing
wheat
long?"
"Why,
sir,
it
was
you
taught
us
the
year
before

You
gave
me
two
measures.
We
sold
about
eight
bushels
and
sowed
a

"Well,

Levin,
going
towards
his
horse,
"and
keep
an
eye

if
there's

shall
have
half

"Hundreds
thankful.
We
are
very
well
content,
sir,
as
it
is."
Levin
got
on
his
horse
and
rode
towards
the
field
where
was
last
year's
clover,"
and
the
one
which
was
ploughed
ready
for
the
spring
corn.
The
crop
of
clover
coming
up
in
the
stubble
was
magnificent.
It
had
survived
everything,
and
stood
up
vividly
green
through
the
broken
stalks
of
last
year's
wheat.
The
horse
sank
in
up
to
the
pastes
and
he
drew
each
hoof
with
a
sucking
sound
out
of
the
half-timbered
ground.
Over
the
ploughs
riding
was
utterly
impossible;
the
horse
could
only
keep
a
foothold
where
there
was
ice,
and
in
the

in

The

in
a

of
days

would
be
fit
for

Everything
was

everything
was

Levin
rode
back
across
the
streams,
hoping
the
water
would
have
gone
down.
And
he
did
in
fact
get
across,
and
startled
two
ducks.
"There
must
be
snipe
too,"
he
thought,
and
just
as
he
reached
the
turning

he
met
the
forest
keeper,
who
confirmed
his
theory

Levin
went
home
at
a
null
so
as
to
have
time
to
eat
his
dinner
and
get
his
gun
ready
for
the
evening.
Chapter
14
As
he
rode
up
to
the
house
in
the
happiest
frame
of
mind,
Levin
heard
the
bell
ring
at
the
side
of
the
principal
entrance
of
the
house.
"Yes,
that's
someone
from
the
railway
station,"
he
thought,
"just
the
time
to
be
here
from
the
Moscow
train
...
Who
could
it
be?
What
if
it's
brother
Nikolayenko
He
did
say:
'Maybe
I'll
go
to
the
waters,
or
maybe
I'll
come
down
to
you.'"
He
felt
dismayed
and
vexed
for
the
first
minute,
that
his
brother
Nikolay,
presence
should
come
to
disturb
his
happy
mood
of
spring.
But
he
felt
ashamed
of
the
feeling,
and
at
once
he
opened,
as
it
were,
the
arms
of
his
soul,
and
with
a
softened
feeling
of
joy
and
expectation,
now
he
hoped
with
all
his
heart
that
it
was
his
brother.
He
pricked
up
his
horse,
and
riding
out
from
behind
the
acacias.
he
saw
a
hired
three-hour
sledge
from
the
railway
station,
and
a
gentleman
in
a
fur
coat.
It
was
not
his
brother.
"Oh,
if
it
were
only
some
nice
person
one
could
talk
to
a
little"
he
thought.
"Ah,"
cried
Levin
joyfully.
flinging
up
both
his
hands.
"Here's
a
delightful
visitor"
Ah,
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you!"
he
shouted,
recognizing
Stepan
Arkalyk
"I
shall
find
out
for
certain
whether
she's
married,
or
when
she's
going
to
be
married,"
he
thought.
And
on
that
delicious
spring
day
he
felt
that
the
thought
of
her
did
not
hurt
him
at
all.
"Well,
you
didn't
expect
me,
eight
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
getting
out
of
the
sledgehammer
splashed
with
mud
on
the
bridge
of
his
nose,
on
his
cheek,
and
on
his
eyebrows,
but
radiant
with
health
and
good
spirits.
"I've
come
to
see
you
in
the
first
place,"
he
said,
embracing
and
kissing
him,
"to
have
some
stand-still
second,
and
to
sell
the
forest
at
Erhac
third."
"Delights
What
a
spring
we're
having,
How
ever

would
have
been

still,
Konstantin
Dmitrin
answered
the
driver,
who
knew
him.
"Well,
I'm
very,
very
glad
to
see
you,"
said
Levin,
with
a
genuine
smile
of
childlike
delight.
Levin
led
his
friend
to
the
room
set
apart
for
visitors,
where
Stepan
Arkalyk
things
were
carried
also-dunked.
bag,
a
gun
in
a
case,
a
satchel
for
cigars.
Leaving
him
there
to
wash
and
change
his
clothes,
Levin
went
off
to
the
counting
house
to
speak
about
the
ploughing
and
clover.
Agag
Mihalowski
always
very
anxious
for
the
credit
of
the
house,
met
him
in
the
hall
with
inquiries
about
dinner.
"Do
just
as
you
like,
only
let
it
be
as
soon
as
possible,"
he
said,
and
went
to
the
bailiffs
When
he
came
back,
Stepan
Arkalyk
washed
and
combed,
came
out
of
his
room
with
a
beaming
smile,
and
they
went
upstairs
together.
"Well,
I
am
glad
I
managed
to
get
away
to
you!
Now
I
shall
understand
what
the
mysterious
business
is
that
you
are
always
absorbed
in
here.
No,
really,
I
envy
you.
What
a
house,
how
nice
it
all
is!
So
bright,
so
null
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
forgetting
that
it
was
not
always
spring
and
fine
weather
like
that
day.
"And
your
nurse
is
simply
charming,
A
pretty
maid
in
an
apron
might
be
even
more
agreeable.
perhaps?
but
for
your
severe
monastic
style
it
does
very
well."
Stepan
Arkalyk
told
him
many
interesting
pieces
of
news;
especially
interesting
to
Levin
was
the
news
that
his
brother,
Sergey
Ivanovo.
was
intending
to
pay
him
a
visit
in
the
summer.
Not
one
word
did
Stepan
Arkalyk
say
in
reference
to
Kitty
and
the
Shtern
he
merely
gave
him
greetings
from
his
wife.
Levin
was
grateful
to
him
for
his
delicacy
and
was
very
glad
of
his
visitor.
As
always
happened
with
him
during
his
solitude,
a
mass
of
ideas
and
feelings
had
been
accumulating
within
him,
which
he
could
not
communicate
to
those
about
him.
And
now
he
poured
out
upon
Stepan
Arkalyk
his
poetic
joy
in
the
spring,
and
his
failures
and
plans
for
the
land,
and
his
thoughts
and
criticisms
on
the
books
he
had
been
reading,
and
the
idea
of
his
own
book,
the
basis
of
which
really
was,
though
he
was
unaware
of
it
himself,
a
criticism
of
all
the
old
books
on
agriculture.
Stepan
Arkalyk
always
charming,
understanding
everything
at
the
slightest
reference,
was
particularly
charming
on
this
visit,
and
Levin
noticed
in
him
a
special
tenderness.
as
it
were,
and
a
new
tone
of
respect
that
flattered
him.
The
efforts
of
Agag
Mihalowski
and
the
cook,
that
the
dinner
should
be
particularly
good,
only
ended
in
the
two
famished
friends
attacking
the
preliminary
course,
eating
a
great
deal
of
bread
and
butter,
salt
goose
and
salted
mushrooms,
and
in
Levin's
finally
ordering
the
soup
to
be
served
without
the
accompaniment
of
little
pies,
with
which
the
cook
had
particularly
meant
to
impress
their
visitor.
But
though
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
accustomed
to
very
different
dinners,
he
thought
everything
excellent:
the
herb
brandy,
and
the
bread,
and
the
butter,
and
above
all
the
salt
goose
and
the
mushrooms,
and
the
nettle
soup,
and
the
chicken
in
white
sauce,
and
the
white
Crimean
wine-and-cheese
was
superb
and
delicious.
"Spoils
splendid"
he
said,
lighting
a
fat
cigar
after
the
roast."
"I
feel
as
if,
coming
to
you,
I
had
landed
on
a
peaceful
shore
after
the
noise
and
jolting
of
a
steamer.
And
so
you
maintain
that
the
laborer
himself
is
an
element
to
be
studied
and
to
regulate
the
choice
of
methods
in
agriculture.
Of
course,
I'm
an
ignorant
outsiders
but
I
should
fancy
theory
and
its
application
will
have
its
influence
on
the
laborer
too."
"Yes,
but
wait
a
bit.
I'm
not
talking
of
political
economy,
I'm
talking
of
the
science
of
agriculture.
It
ought
to
be
like
the
natural
sciences,
and
to
observe
given
phenomena

At
that
instant
Agag
Mihalowski
came
in
with
jam.
"Oh,
Agag
Mihalowski

Stepan
Arkalyk
kissing
the
tips
of
his
plump
fingers,
"what
salt
goose,
what
herb

What

you
think,
isn't
it

to

Kostyra,
he
added.
Levin
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
sun
sinking
behind
the
bare
tree-trimming
of
the
forest.
"Yes,
it's
time,"
he
said.
"Kowliga"
get
ready
the
trap,"
and
he
ran
downstairs.
Stepan
Arkalyk
going
down,
carefully
took
the
canvas
cover
off
his
varnished
gun
case
with
his
own
hands,
and
opening
it,
began
to
get
ready
his
expensive
new-felt
gun.
Kouzmine
who
already
scented
a
big
tip,
never
left
Stepan
Arkalyk

and
put
on
him
both
his
stockings
and
boots,
a
task
which
Stepan
Arkalyk
readily
left
him.
"Kotch"

the

I
told
him
to

he's

and
to
wait
for

"Why,

"Yes.

"To

"Yes,

the

he
added,
patting
Lasker
who
hung
about
Levin,
whining
and
licking
his
hands,
his
boots,
and
his
gun.
The
trap
was
already
at
the
steps
when
they
went
out.
"I
told
them
to
bring
the
trap
round;
or
would

"No,
we'd
better
drive,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
getting
into
the
trap.
He
sat
down,

round
him,
and
lighted
a

"Why,

said
Levin,
smiling.
"No,

"Perhaps
because
I
rejoice
in
what
I
have,
and
don't
fret
for
what
I
haven't,"
said
Levin,
thinking
of
Kitty.
Stepan
Arkalyk
comprehending
looked
at
him,
but
said
nothing.
Levin
was
grateful
to
Obninsk's
for
noticing,
with
his
never-finished
tact,
that
he
dreaded
conversation
about
the
Shtern
and
so
saying
nothing
about
them.
But
now
Levin
was
longing
to
find
out
what
was
tormenting
him
so,
yet
he
had
not
the
courage
to
begin.
"Come,
tell
me
how
things
are
going
with
you,"
said
Levin,
null
himself
that
it
was
not
nice
of
him
to
think
only
of
himself.

sparkled

but
I
don't
count

as

he
said,
taking
Levin's
question
his
own
way.
"What
am
I
to
do?
I'm
made
that
way.
And
really,

so

"What's
is
there
something
new,
then?"
queried
Levin.
"Yes,
my
boy,
there
is!
There,
do
you
see,
you
know
the
type
of
Ossie
women:
Women,
such
as

sometimes
to

these
women
are
terrible.

such
a
subject
that
however
much
you
study
it,
it's
always
perfectly

"Well,
then,
it
would
be
better
not
to
study
it."
"No.
Some
mathematician
has
said
that
enjoyment
lies
in
the
search
for
truth,
not
in
the
finding
it."
Levin
listened
in
silence,
and
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
he
made,
he
could
not
in
the
least
enter
into
the
feelings
of
his
friend
and
understand
his
sentiments
and
the
charm
of
studying
such
women.
Chapter
15
The
place
fixed
on
for
the
stand-still
was
not
far
above
a
stream
in
a
little
aspen
copshop
On
reaching
the
copshop
Levin
got
out
of
the
trap
and
led
Obninsk's
to
a
corner
of
a
mossy,
swampy
glam-mad
already
quite
free
from
snow.
He
went
back
himself
to
a
double
birch
tree
on
the
other
side,
and
leaning
his
gun
on
the
fork
of
a
dead
lower
branch,
he
took
off
his
full
overcoat,
fastened
his
belt
again,
and
worked
his
arms
to
see
if
they
were
free.
Gray
old
Lasker
who
had
followed
them,
sat
down
warily
opposite
him
and
pricked
up
her
ears.
The
sun
was
setting
behind
a
thick
forest,
and
in
the
glow
of
sunset
the
birch
trees,
dotted
about
in
the
aspen
copshop
stood
out
clearly
with
their
hanging
twigs.
and
their
buds
swollen
almost
to
bursting.
From
the
thickest
parts
of
the
copshop
where
the
snow
still
remained,
came
the
faint
sound
of
narrow
winding
threads
of
water
running
away.
Tiny
birds
twitty
and
now
and
then
fluttered
from
tree
to
tree.
In
the
pauses
of
complete
stillness
there
came
the
rustle
of
last
year's
leaves,
stirred
by
the
thawing
of
the
earth
and
the
growth
of
the
grass.
"Imagine"
One
can
hear
and
see
the
grass
growing,
Levin
said
to
himself,
noticing
a
wet,
slate-colored
aspen
leaf
moving
beside
a
blade
of
young
grass.
He
stood,
listened,
and
gazed
sometimes
down
at
the
wet
mossy
ground,
sometimes
at
Lasker
listening
all
alert,
sometimes
at
the
sea
of
bare
tree
tops
that
stretched
on
the
slope
below
him,
sometimes
at
the
darkening
sky,
covered
with
white
streaks
of
cloud.
A
hawk
flew
high
over
a
forest
far
away
with
slow
sweep
of
its
wingspan
another
flew
with
exactly
the
same
motion
in
the
same
direction
and
vanished.
The
birds
twitty
more
and
more
loudly
and
busily
in
the
thicket.
An
owl
hooted
not
far
off,
and
Lasker
starting,
stepped
cautiously
a
few
steps
forward,
and
putting
her
head
on
one
side,
began
to
listen
intently.
Beyond
the
stream
was
heard
the
cuckoo.'
Twice
she
uttered
her
usual
cuckoo
call,
and
then
gave
a
hoarsely
hurried
call
and
broke
down.
"Imagine"
the
cuckoo
already!"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
coming
out
from
behind
a
bush.
"Yes,
I
hear
it,"
answered
Levin,
reluctantly
breaking
the
stillness
with
his
voice,
which
sounded
disagreeable
to
himself.
"Now
it's
coming)
Stepan
Arkalyk
figure
again
went
behind
the
bush,
and
Levin
saw
nothing
but
the
bright
flash
of
a
match,
followed
by
the
red
glow
and
blue
smoke
of
a
cigarette.
"Te
tday
came
the
snapping
sound
of
Stepan
Arkalyk
cockle
his
gun.
"What's
that
cry?"
asked
Obninsk's
drawing
Levin's
attention
to
a
prolonged
cry,
as
though
a
colt
were
whiny
in
a
high
voice,
in
play.
"Oh,
don't
you
know
it?
That's
the
hare.
But
enough
talking"
Listen.
it's
flying"
almost
shrieked
Levin,
cockle
his
gun.
They
heard
a
shrill
whistle
in
the
distance,
and
in
the
exact
time,
so
well
known
to
the
sportsman,
two
seconds
later-closing
a
third,
and
after
the
third
whistle
the
hoarsely
guttural
cry
could
be
heard.
Levin
looked
about
him
to
right
and
to
left,
and
there,
just
facing
him
against
the
dusky
blue
sky
above
the
confused
mass
of
tender
shoots
of
the
aspens.
he
saw
the
flying
bird.
It
was
flying
straight
towards
him;
the
guttural
cry,
like
the
even
tearing
of
some
strong
stuff,
sounded
close
to
his
ear?"
the
long
beak
and
neck
of
the
bird
could
be
seen,
and
at
the
very
instant
when
Levin
was
taking
aim,
behind
the
bush
where
Obninsk's
stood,
there
was
a
flash
of
red
lightpoles
the
bird
dropped
like
an
arrow,
and
darted
upwards
again.
Again
came
the
red
flash
and
the
sound
of
a
blow,
and
fluttering
its
wings
as
though
trying
to
keep
up
in
the
air,
the
bird
halted,
stopped
still
an
instant,
and
fell
with
a
heavy
splash
on
the
slushy
ground.
"Can
I
have
missed
it?"
shouted
Stepan
Arkalyk
who
could
not
see
for
the
smoke.
"Here
it
isue.
said
Levin,
pointing
to
Lasker
who
with
one
ear
raised,
wagging
the
end
of
her
shaggy
tail,
came
slowly
back
as
though
she
would
prolong
the
pleasure,
and
as
it
were
smiling,
brought
the
dead
bird
to
her
master.
"Well,
I'm
glad
you
were
successful,"
said
Levin,
who,
at

responded
Stepan

loading
his
gun.
"Shadey."

flying"
The
shrill
whistles
rapidly
following
one
another
were
heard
again.
Two
sniped
playing
and
chasing
one
another,
and
only
whistling,
not
crying,
flew
straight
at
the
very
heads
of
the
sportsmen.
There
was
the
report
of
four
shots,
and
like
swallows
the
snipe
turned
swift
somersaults
in
the
air
and
vanished
from
sight.
The
stand-still
was
capital.
Stepan
Arkalyk
shot
two
more
birds
and
Levin
two,
of
which
one
was
not
found.
It
began
to
get
dark.
Venus,
bright
and
silvery-white
shone
with
her
soft
light
low
down
in
the
west
behind
the
birch
trees,
and
high
up
in
the
east
twinkled
the
red
lights
of
Arcudi,
Over
his
head
Levin
made
out
the
stars
of
the
Great
Bear
and
lost
them
again.
The
snipe
had
ceased
flyingest
but
Levin
resolved
to
stay
a
little
longer,
till
Venus,
which
he
saw
below
a
branch
of
birch-fringed
should
be
above
it,
and
the
stars
of
the
Great
Bear
should
be
perfectly
plain.
Venus
had
risen
above
the
branch,
and
the
ear
of
the
Great
Bear
with
its
shaft
was
now
all
plainly
visible
against
the
dark
blue
sky,
yet
still
he
waited.
"Isn't
it
time
to
go
home?"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
It
was
quite
still
now
in
the
copshop
and
not
a
bird
was
stirring.
"Let's
stay
a
little
while,"
answered
Levin.
"As
you
like."
They
were
standing
now
about
fifteen
paces
from
one
another.
"Stock
said
Levin
unexpended
"how
is
it
you
don't
tell
me
whether
your
sister-in-law,
married
yet,
or
when
she's
going
to
be?"
Levin
felt
so
resolute
and
serene
that
no
answer,
he
fancier
could
affect
him.
But
he
had
never
dreamed
of
what
Stepan
Arkalyk
replied.
"She's
never
thought
of
being
married,
and
isn't
thinking
of
it;
but
she's
very
ill,
and
the
doctors
have
sent
her
abroad.
They're
positively
afraid
she
may
not
live."
"What's
cried
Levin.
"Very
illed
What
is
wrong
with
her?
How
has

While
they
were
saying
this,
Lasker
with
ears
pricked
up,
was
looking
upwards
at
the
sky,
and
reproachfully
at
them.
"They
have
chosen
a
time
to
talk,"
she
was
thinking.
"It's
on
the
wing?"
Here
it
is,
yes,
it
is.
They'll
miss
it,"
thought
Lasker
But
at
that
very
instant
both
suddenly
heard
a
shrill
whistle
which,
as
it
were,
smote
on
their
ears,
and
both
suddenly
seized
their
guns
and
two
flashes
gleaming
and
two
bangs
sounded
at
the
very
same
instant.
The
snipe
flying
high
above
instantly
folded
its
wings
and
fell
into
a
thicket,
bending
down
the
delicate
shoots.
"Spoils
Together"
cried
Levin,
and
he
ran
with
Lasker
into
the
thicket
to
look
for
the
sniped
"Oh,
yes,
what
was
it
that
was
unpleasantly
he
wondered.
"Yes,
Kitty,
illed
Well,
it
can't
be
helped;
I'm
very
sorry,"
he
thought.
"She's
found
it!
Isn't
she
a
clever
thing?"
he
said,
taking
the
warm
bird
from
Lasker
mouth
and
packing
it
into
the
almost
full
game
bag.
"I've
got
it,

he
shouted.

On
the
way
home
Levin
asked
all
details
of
Kitty,
illness
and
the
Shtern
plans,
and
though
he
would
have
been
ashamed
to
admit
it,
he
was
pleased
at
what
he
heard.
He
was
pleased
that
there
was
still
hope,
and
still
more
pleased
that
she
should
be

had
made
him
suffer
so
much.
But
when
Stepan

began
to
speak
of
the
causes
of

and
mentioned

Levin
cut
him
short.
"I

the

in

catching
the
instantaneous
change
he
knew
so
well
in
Levin's
face,
which
had
become
as
gloomy
as
it
had
been
bright
a
minute
before.
"Have
you
quite
settled
about
the
forest
with
Ryabov
asked
Levin.
"Yes,
it's

The

is

"Then
you've

said
Levin

"How
do
you

for
nothingness
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
with
a
good-humored
smile,
knowing
that
nothing
would
be
right
in
Levin's
eyes
now.
"Because
the
forest
is
worth

Levin.

said
he,
"and
if

"Oh,

then?"
"Why,

I've

of

"Not

said
Levin
gloomy
as
they
drove
up
to
the
house.
At
the
steps
there
stood
a
trap
tightly
covered
with
iron
and
leather,
with
a
sleek
horse
tightly
harnessed
with
broad
collar.
In
the
trap
sat
the
chubby,
tightly
belted
clerk
who
served
Ryabov
as
coadjutor
Ryabov
himself
was
already
in
the
house,
and
met
the
friends
in
the
hall.
Ryabov
was
a
tall,
thinnish,
middle-aged
man,
with
mustache
and
a
projecting
clean-shaven
chin,
and
prominent
muddy.
eyes.
He
was
dressed
in
a
long-sleeve
blue
coat,
with
buttons
below
the
waist
at
the
back,
and
wore
high
boots
wrinkled
over
the
ankles
and
straight
over
the
calf,
with
big
null
drawn
over
them.
He
rubbed
his
face
with
his
handkerchief.
and
wrapping
round
him
his
coat,
which
sat
extremely
well
as
it
was,
he
greeted
them
with
a
smile,
holding
out
his
hand
to
Stepan
Arkalyk
as
though
he
wanted
to
catch
something.
"So
here
you
are,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
giving
him
his
hand.
"That's
capital."
"I
did
not
venture
to
disregard
your
excellent
commands,
though
the
road
was
extremely
bad.
I
positively
walked
the

I

turned
to
Levin,
trying
to
seize

too.
But
Levin,

not
notice
his

and
took
out

sniped

added
Ryabov
looking
contemptuously
at
the
sniped
"a
great
delicacy,
I
suppose."
And
he
shook
his
head
disapprovingly.
as
though
he
had
grave
doubts
whether
this
game
were
worth
the
candle.
"Would
you
like
to
go
into
my
studying
Levin
said
in
French
to
Stepan
Arkalyk
scowling
morosite
"Go
into
my
study;
you
can
talk
there."
"Quite
so,
where
you
please,"
said
Ryabov
with
contemptuous
dignity,
as
though
wishing
to
make
it
felt
that
others
might
be
in
difficulties
as
to
how
to
behave,
but
that
he
could
never
be
in
any
difficulty
about
anything.
On
entering
the
study
Ryabov
looked
about,
as
his
habit
was,
as
though
seeking
the
holy
picture,
but
when
he
had
found
it,
he
did
not
cross
himself.
He
scanned
the
bookcases
and
bookshelves,
and
with
the
same
dubious
air
with
which
he
had
regarded
the
sniped
he
smiled
contemptuously
and
shook
his
head
disapprovingly.
as
though
by
no
means
willing
to
allow
that
this
game
were
worth
the
candle.
"Well,
have
you
brought
the
money?"
asked
Obninsk's
"Sit
down."
"Oh,
don't
trouble
about
the
money.
I've
come
to
see
you
to
talk
it
over."
"What
is
there
to
talk
over?
But
do
sit
down."
"I
don't
mind
if
I
do,"
said
Ryabov
sitting
down
and
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
back
of
his
chair
in
a
position
of
the
intensifed
discomfort
to
himself.
"You
must
knock
it
down
a
bit,

It
would
be

Levin,
who
had
meanwhile
been
putting
his
gun
away
in
the
cupboard,
was
just
going
out
of
the
door,
but
catching
the
merchant's
words,
he
stopped.
"Why,
you've
got
the
forest
for
nothing
as
it
is,"
he
said.
"He
came
to
me
too
late,
or
I'd
have
fixed
the
price
for
him."
Ryabov
got
up,
and
in
silence,
with
a
smile,
he
looked
Levin
down
and
up.
"Very

he
said
with
a
smile,
turning
to
Stepan

"there's

was
bargaining
for

and
a

"Why

nor

"Merger

"But

if

said
Levin,
"I'll

The
smile
vanished
at
once
from
Ryabov
face.
A
hawks
greedy,
cruel
expression
was
left
upon
it.
With
rapid,
bony
fingers
he
unbuttoned
his
coat,
revealing
a
shirt,

buttons,
and
a
watch
chain,
and
quickly
pulled
out
a
fat
old
pocketbook.
"Here
you
are,

is
mine,"
he
said,
crossing
himself
quickly,
and
holding
out
his
hand.
"Take

added,
scowling
and
waving
the

"I
wouldn't
be
in
a

if
I
were

said
Levin.
"Come,

said
Obninsk's
in
surprise.
"I've
given
my
word,

know."
Levin
went
out
of
the
room,
slamming
the
door.
Ryabov
looked
towards
the

and
shook
his
head
with
a

Stepan
Arkalyk
went
upstairs
with
his
pocket
bulging
with
notes,
which
the
merchant
had
paid
him
for
three
months
in
advance.
The
business
of
the
forest
was
over,
the
money
in
his
pocket;
their
shooting
had
been
excellent,
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
in
the
happiest
frame
of
mind,
and
so
he
felt
specially
anxious
to
dissipate
the
ill-informed,
that
had
come
upon
Levin.
He
wanted
to
finish
the
day
at
supper
as
pleasantly
as
it
had
been
begun.
Levin
certainly
was
out
of
humor,
and
in
spite
of
all
his
desire
to
be
affectionate
and
cordial
to
his
charming
visitor,
he
could
not
control
his
mood.
The
intoxication
of
the
news
that
Kitty
was
not
married
had
gradually
begun
to
work
upon
him.
Kitty
was
not
married,
but
ill,
and
ill
from
love
for
a
man
who
had
slighted
her.
This
slight,
as
it
were,
rebounded
upon
him.
Vrye
had
slighted
her,
and
she
had
slighted
him,
Levin.
Consequently
Vrye
had
the
right
to
despise
Levin,
and
therefore
he
was
his
enemy.
But
all
this
Levin
did
not
think
out.
He
vaguely
felt
that
there
was
something
in
it
insulting
to
him,
and
he
was
not
angry
now
at
what
had
disturbed
him,
but
he
fell
foul
of
everything
that
presented
itself.
The
stupid
sale
of
the
forest,
the
fraud
practiced
upon
Obninsk's
and
concluded
in
his
house,
exasperated
him.
"Well,
finisher
he
said,
meeting
Stepan
Arkalyk
upstairs.
"Would
you
like
suppers
"Well,
I
wouldn't
say
no
to
it.
What
an
appetite
I
get
in
the
country!
null
Why
didn't
you
offer
Ryabov
something?"
"Oh,
damn
him!"
"Still,
how
you
do
treat
him!"
said
Obninsk's
"You
didn't
even
shake
hands
with
him.
Why
not
shake
hands
with
him?"
"Because
I
don't
shake
hands
with
a
waiter,
and
a
waiter's
a
hundred
times
better
than
he
is."
"What
a

you
are,
really'.
What

Stepan
Arkalyk
sat
down
at
the
table
and
began
joking
with
Agag
Mihalowski
assuring
her
that
it
was
long
since
he
had
tasted
such
a
dinner
and
such
a
supper.
"Well,
you
do
praise
it,
anyway,"
said
Agag
Mihalowski
"but
Konstantin
Dmitrin
give
him
what
you
will-o'-the-wisp,
crust
of
bread-and-butter
eat
it
and
walk
away."
Though
Levin
tried
to
control
himself,
he
was
gloomy
and
silent.
He
wanted
to
put
one
question
to
Stepan
Arkalyk
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
the
point,
and
could
not
find
the
words
or
the
moment
in
which
to
put
it.
Stepan
Arkalyk
had
gone
down
to
his
room,
undressed,
again
washed,
and
attired
in
a
nightshirt,
with
goggle
frills,
he
had
got
into
bed,
but
Levin
still
lingered
in
his
room,
talking
of
various
trifling
matters,
and
not
daring
to
ask
what
he
wanted
to
know.
"How
wonderfully
they
make
this
soap,"
he
said
gazing
at
a
piece
of
soap
he
was
handling,
which
Agag
Mihalowski
had
put
ready
for
the
visitor
but
Obninsk's
had
not
used.
"Only
look?
why,
it's
a
work
of
art."
"Yes,
everything's
brought
to
such
a
pitch
of
perfection
nowadays,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
with
a
moist
and
blissful
yawn.
"The

for
instance,
and
the
entertainments
...
a-begging

yawner
"The

...
a-begging
"Yes,
the
electric

said
Levin.
"Yes.
Oh,
and
where's
Vrye
now?"
he
asked
suddenly,
laying
down
the
soap.
"Vue
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
checking
his
yawned
"he's
in
Petersburg.
He
left
soon
after
you
did,
and
he's
not
once
been
in
Moscow
since.
And
do
you
know,
Kostyra,
I'll
tell
you
the
truth,"
he
went
on,
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
table,
and
propping
on
his
hand
his
handsome
ruddy
face,
in
which
his
moist,
good-natured,
sleepy
eyes
shone
like
stars.
"It's
your
own
fault.
You
took
fright
at
the
sight
of
your
rival.
But,
as
I
told
you
at
the
time,
I
couldn't
say
which
had
the
better
chance.
Why
didn't
you
fight
it
out?
I
told
you
at
the
time
that:
He
yawned
inwardly,
without
opening
his
mouth.
"Does
he
know,
or
doesn't
he,
that
I
did
make
an
offer?"
Levin
wondered,
gazing
at
him.
"Yes,
there's
something
humbugs,"
diplomatic
in
his
face,"
and
feeling
he
was
blushing.
he
looked
Stepan
Arkalyk
straight
in
the
face
without
speaking.
"If
there
was
anything
on
her
side
at
the
time,
it
was
nothing
but
a
superficial
attraction,"
pursued
Obninsk's
"His
being
such
a
perfect
aristocrat,
don't
you
know,
and
his
future
position
in
society,
had
an
influence
not
with
her,
but
with
her
mother."
Levin
scowled.
The
humiliation
of
his
rejection
stung
him
to
the
heart,
as
though
it
were
a
fresh
wound
he
had
only
just
received.
But
he
was
at
home,
and
the
walls
of
home
are
a
support.
"Staying
stay,"
he
began,
interrupting
Obninsk's
"You
talk
of
his
being
an
aristocrat.
But
allow
me
to
ask
what
it
consists
in,
that
aristocracy

Vrye

of
anybody
else,

I
can

I
don't.

another
matter,
and

never
curried

with
anyone,

on
anyone

anything,
like

my

And
I

you

so
I
prize
what's

to
me

We
are

and
who
can
be

"Well,
but
whom
are
you
attacking?"
I
agree
with
you,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
sincerely
and
genie
though
he
was
aware
that
in
the
class
of
those
who
could
be
bought
for

Levin
was
reckoning
him
too.
Levin's
warmth
gave
him
genuine
pleasure.
"Whomsoever
are
you
attacking?"
Though
a
good
deal
is
not
true
that
you
say
about
Vrye
but
I
won't
talk
about
that.
I
tell
you
straight
out,
if
I

I

"But

won't

Please
forgive
me,

said
Levin.
Now
that
he
had
opened
his
heart,
he
became
as
he
had
been
in
the
morning.
"You're
not
angry
with
me,
Stivaletti
Please
don't
be
angry,"
he
said,
and
smiling,
he
took
his
hand.
"Of
course
not;
not
a

and
no

to

I'm
glad

"Capitalism
Chapter
18
Although
all
Vrye
inner
life
was
absorbed
in
his
passion,
his
external
life
unaltered
and
inevitably
followed
along
the
old
accustomed
lines
of
his
social
and
regimental
ties
and
interests.
The
interests
of
his
regiment
took
an
important
place
in
Vrye
life,
both
because
he
was
fond
of
the
regiment,
and
because
the
regiment
was
fond
of
him.
They
were
not
only
fond
of
Vrye
in
his
regiment,
they
respected
him
too,
and
were
proud
of
him;
proud
that
this
man,
with
his
immense
wealth,
his
brilliant
education
and
abilities,
and
the
path
open
before
him
to
every
kind
of
success,
distinction,
and
ambition,
had
disregarded
all
that,
and
of
all
the
interests
of
life
had
the
interests
of
his
regiment
and
his
comrades
nearest
to
his
heart.
Vrye
was
aware
of
his
comrades,
view
of
him,
and
in
addition
to
his
liking
for
the
life,
he
felt
bound
to
keep
up
that
reputation.
It
need
not
be
said
that
he
did
not
speak
of
his
love
to
any
of
his
comrades,
nor
did
he
betray
his
secret
even
in
the
wildest
drinking
bouts
(though
indeed
he
was
never
so
drunk
as
to
lose
all
control
of
himself).
And
he
shut
up
any
of
his
thoughtless
comrades
who
attempted
to
allude
to
his
connection.
But
in
spite
of
that,
his
love
was
known
to
all
the
town;
everyone
guessed
with
more
or
less
confidence
at
his
relations
with
Madame
Karennis
The
majority
of
the
younger
men
envied
him
for
just
what
was
the
most
irksome
factor
in
his
love-affair
exalted
position
of
Karenina
and
the
consequent
publicity
of
their
connection
in
society.
The
greater
number
of
the
young
women,
who
envied
Anna
and
had
long
been
weary
of
hearing
her
called
_were
rejoiced
at
the
fulfillment
of
their
predictions,
and
were
only
waiting
for
a
decisive
turn
in
public
opinion
to
fall
upon
her
with
all
the
weight
of
their
scorn.
They
were
already
making
ready
their
handfuls
of
mud
to
fling
at
her
when
the
right
moment
arrived.
The
greater
number
of
the
middle-aged
people
and
certain
great
personal
were
displeased
at
the
prospect
of
the
impending
scandal
in
society.
Vrye
mother,
on
hearing
of
his
connection,
was
at
first
pleased
at
it,
because
nothing
to
her
mind
gave
such
a
finishing
touch
to
a
brilliant
young
man
as
a
_may
in
the
highest
society;
she
was
pleased,
too,
that
Madame
Karennis
who
had
so
taken
her
fancy,
and
had
talked
so
much
of
her
son,
was,
after
all,
just
like
all
other
pretty
and
well-bred
women-in-medicine
least
according
to
the
Countess
Vrye
ideas.
But
she
had
heard
of
late
that
her
son
had
refused
a
position
offered
him
of
great
importance
to
his
career,
simply
in
order
to
remain
in
the
regiment,
where
he
could
be
constantly
seeing
Madame
Karennis
She
learned
that
great
personal
were
displeased
with
him
on
this
account,
and
she
changed
her
opinion.
She
was
vexes
too,
that
from
all
she
could
learn
of
this
connection
it
was
not
that
brilliant,
graceful,
worldly
_may
which
she
would
have
welcomed,
but
a
sort
of
Wertman,
desperate
passion,
so
she
was
told,
which
might
well
lead
him
into
imprudent
She
had
not
seen
him
since
his
abrupt
departure
from
Moscow,
and
she
sent
her
elder
son
to
bid
him
come
to
see
her.
This
elder
son,
too,
was
displeased
with
his
younger
brother.
He
did
not
distinguish
what
sort
of
love
his
might
be,
big
or
little,
passionate
or
passionless,
lasting
or
passing
(he
kept
a
ballet
girl
himself,
though
he
was
the
father
of
a
family,
so
he
was
lenient
in
these
matters,
but
he
knew
that
this
love
affair
was
viewed
with
displeasure
by
those
whom
it
was
necessary
to
please,
and
therefore
he
did
not
approve
of
his
brother's
conduct.
Besides
the
service
and
society,
Vrye
had
another
great
interest-bearing
he
was
passionately
fond
of
horses.
That
year
races
and
a
steeplechase
had
been
arranged
for
the
officers.
Vrye
had
put
his
name
down,
bought
a
thoroughbred
English
mare,
and
in
spite
of
his
love
affair,
he
was
looking
forward
to
the
races
with
intense,
though
reserved,
excitement:
These
two
passions
did
not
interfere
with
one
another.
On
the
contrary,
he
needed
occupation
and
distraction
quite
apart
from
his
love,
so
as
to
recruit
and
rest
himself
from
the
violent
emotions
that
agitated
him.
Chapter
19
On
the
day
of
the
races
at
Krasnoff,
Seloken,
Vrye
had
come
earlier
than
usual
to
eat
beefsteak
in
the
common
null
of
the
regiment.
He
had
no
need
to
be
strict
with
himself,
as
he
had
very
quickly
been
brought
down
to
the
required
light
weight;
but
still
he
had
to
avoid
gaining
flesh,
and
so
he
eschewed
faring
and
sweet
dishes.
He
sat
with
his
coat
unbuttoned
over
a
white
waistcoats
resting
both
elbows
on
the
table,
and
while
waiting
for
the
steak
he
had
ordered
he
looked
at
a
French
novel
that
lay
open
on
his
plate.
He
was
only
looking
at
the
book
to
avoid
conversation
with
the
officers
coming
in
and
out;
he
was
thinking.
He
was
thinking
of
Anna's
promise
to
see
him
that
day
after
the
races.
But
he
had
not
seen
her
for
three
days,
and
as
her
husband
had
just
returned
from
abroad,
he
did
not
know
whether
she
would
be
able
to
meet
him
today
or
not,
and
he
did
not
know
how
to
find
out.
He
had
had
his
last
interview
with
her
at
his
cousin
Betsy's
summer
villa.
He
visited
the
Karennis
summer
villa
as
rarely
as
possible.
Now
he
wanted
to
go
there,
and
he
pondered
the
question
how
to
do
it.
"Of
course
I
shall
say
Betsy
has
sent
me
to
ask
whether
she's
coming
to
the
races.
Of
course,
I'll
go,"
he
decided,
lifting
his
head
from
the
book.
And
as
he
vividly
pictured
the
happiness
of
seeing
her,
his
face
lighted
up.
"Send
to
my
house,
and
tell
them
to
have
out
the
carriage
and
three
horses
as
quick
as
they
can,"
he
said
to
the
servant,
who
handed
him
the
steak
on
a
hot
silver
dish,
and
moving
the
dish
up
he
began
eating.
From
the
billiard
room
next
door
came
the
sound
of
balls
knocking,"
of
talk
and
laughter.
Two
officers
appeared
at
the
entrance.
one,
a
young
fellow,
with
a
feeble,
delicate
face,
who
had
lately
joined
the
regiment
from
the
Corps
of
Paget
the
other,
a
plump,
elderly
officer,
with
a
bracelet
on
his
wrist,
and
little
eyes,
lost
in
fat.
Vrye
glanced
at
them,
frowned,
and
looking
down
at
his
book
as
though
he
had
not
noticed
them,
he
proceeded
to
eat
and
read
at
the
same
time.
"Whatever
Fortin
yourself
for
your
work?"
said
the
plump
officer,
sitting
down
beside
him.
"As
you
see,"
responded
Vrye
knitting
his
brows,
wiping
his
mouth,
and
not
looking
at
the
officer.
"So
you're
not
afraid
of
getting
fatal
said
the
latter,
turning
a
chair

without

to

he
went

The
plump
officer
took
up
the
list
of
wines
and
turned
to
the
young
officer.
"You
choose
what
we're
to
drink,"
he
said,
handing
him
the
card,
and
looking
at
him.
"Rhine

said
the
young
officer,
stealing
a
timid
glance
at
Vrye
and
trying
to
pull
his
scarcely
visible

Seeing
that
Vrye
did
not

round,
the
young
officer
got
up.
"Let's
go
into

he
said.
The

rose

moved
towards

At

walked
into

the

and

Captain

an
air
of
lofty

Vrye

dropped,
glancing
sarcastically
at
the
two
officers
who
were
at
that
instant
leaving
the
room.
And
he
bent
his
long
legs,
swathed
in
tight
riding
breeches,
and
sat
down
in
the
chair,
too
low
for
him,
so
that
his

were
cramped
up
in
a
sharp
angle.

Yasih

a
man
not
merely
without
moral
principles,
but
of
immoral
principles,
Yasih
was
Vrye
greatest
friend
in
the
regiment.
Vrye
liked
him
both
for
his
exceptional
physical
strength,
which
he
showed
for
the
most
part
by
being
able
to
drink
like
a
fish,
and
do
without
sleep
without
being
in
the
slightest
degree
affected
by
it;
and
for
his
great
strength
of
character,
which
he
showed
in
his
relations
with
his
comrades
and
superior
officers,
commanding
both
fear
and
respect,
and
also
at
cards,
when
he
would
play
for
tens
of
thousands
and
however
much
he
might
have
drunk,
always
with
such
skill
and
decision
that
he
was
reckoned
the
best
player
in
the
English
Club.
Vrye
respected
and
liked
Yasih
particularly
because
he
felt
Yasih
liked
him,
not
for
his
name
and
his
money,
but
for
himself.
And
of
all
men
he
was
the
only
one
with
whom
Vrye
would
have
liked
to
speak
of
his
love.
He
felt
that
Yasih
in
spite
of
his
apparent
contempt
for
every
sort
of
feeling,
was
the
only
man
who
could,
so
he
fancier
comprehend
the
intense
passion
which
now
filled
his
whole
life.
Moreover,
he
felt
certain
that
Yasih
as
it
was,
took
no
delight
in
gossip
and
scandal,
and
interpreted
his
feeling
rightly,
that
is
to
say,
knew
and
believed
that
this
passion
was
not
a
jest,
not
a
pastime,
but
something
more
serious
and
important.
Vrye
had
never
spoken
to
him
of
his
passion,
but
he
was
aware
that
he
knew
all
about
it,
and
that
he
put
the
right
interpretation
on
it,
and
he
was
glad
to
see
that
in
his
eyes.
"Ah!
yes,"
he
said,
to
the
announcement
that
Vrye
had
been
at
the
Tvorba
and
his
black
eyes
shining.
he
plucked
at
his
left
mustache,
and
began
twisting
it
into
his
mouth,
a
bad
habit
he
had.
"Well,
and
what
did
you
do
yesterday?
Win
anything?"
asked
Vrye
"Eight
thousand.
But
three
don't
count;
he
won't
pay
up."
"Oh,
then
you
can
afford
to
lose
over
me,"
said
Vrye
laughing.
(Yasir)
had
bet
heavily
on
Vrye
in
the
races:
"No
chance
of
my
losing.
Mahr
the
only
one
that's
risky."
And
the
conversation
passed
to
forecasts
of
the
coming
race,
the
only
thing
Vrye
could
think
of
just
now.
"Come
along,
I've
finished,"
said
Vrye
and
getting
up
he
went
to
the
door.
Yasih
got
up
too,
stretching
his
long
legs
and
his
long
back.
"It's
too
early
for
me
to
dine,
but
I
must
have
a
drink.
I'll
come
along
directly.
Hi,

he
shouted,
in
his
rich
voice,
that
always
rang
out
so
loudly
at
drill,
and
set
the
windows
shaking
now.
"No,
all
right,"
he
shouted
again
immediately
after.
"You're
going
home,
so
I'll
go
with
you."
And
he
walked

with

"Shut

turned
over

opened
his

In

"Later,

The
temporary
stable,
a
wooden
shed,
had
been
put
up
close
to
the

there
his
mare
was
to
have
been
taken
the
previous
day.
He
had
not

During

had

went
into
the
little
yard

A
stable
boy,
spruce
and
smart
in
his
holiday
attire,
met
them
with
a
broom
in
his
hand,
and
followed
them.
In
the
shed
there
were
five
horses
in
their
separate
stalls,

Vrye
knew
that
his
chief
rival,
Gladiators

very
tall
chestnut
horse,
had
been
brought
there,

must
be
standing
among

Even
more
than

Vrye
longed
to
see
Gladiators

he
had
never

But
he
knew
that
by
the
etiquette
of

course
it
was
not
merely
impossible
for
him
to
see
the
horse,
but
improper
even
to
ask
questions
about
him.
Just
as
he
was
passing
along
the
passage,
the
boy
opened
the
door
into
the
second
horse-breeder.
on
the
left,
and
Vrye
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
big
chestnut
horse
with
white
legs.
He
knew
that
this
was
Gladiators
but,
with
the
feeling
of

man
turning
away
from
the
sight
of

and
fore-runner,

thicken
but
across
her
shoulders
the
mare
was
exceptionally
broad,
a
peculiarity
specially
striking
now
that
she
was
lean
from
training.
The
bones
of
her
legs
below
the
knees
looked
no
thicker
than
a
finger
from
in
front,
but
were
extraordinarily
thick
seen
from
the
side.
She
looked
altogether,
except
across
the
shoulders,
as
it
were,
pinched
in
at
the
sides
and
pressed
out
in
depth.
But
she
had
in
the
highest
degree
the
quality
that
makes
all
defects
forgotten:
that
quality
was
_briefly
the
blood
_the
telltale
as
the
English
expression
has
it.
The
muscles
stood
up
sharply
under
the
network
of
sinewy
covered
with
the
delicate,
mobile
skin,
soft
as
satin,
and
they
were
hard
as
bone.
Her
clean-cut
head,
with
prominent,
bright,
spirited
eyes,
broadened
out
at
the
open
nostrils,
that
showed
the
red
blood
in
the
cartilage
within.
About
all
her
figure,
and
especially
her
head,
there
was
a
certain
expression
of
energy,
and,
at
the
same
time,
of
softness.
She
was
one
of
those
creatures
which
seem
only
not
to
speak
because
the
mechanism
of
their
mouth
does
not
allow
them
to.
To
Vrye
at
any
rate,
it
seemed
that
she
understood
all
he
felt
at
that
moment,
looking
at
her.
Directly
Vrye
went
towards
her,
she
drew
in
a
deep
breath,
and,
turning
back
her
prominent
eye
till
the
white
looked
bloodshot,
she
started
at
the
approaching
figures
from
the
opposite
side,
shaking
her
muzzle,
and
shifting
lightly
from
one
leg
to
the
other.
"There,
you
see
how
fidgety
she
is,"
said
the
Englishman.
"There,
darling"),
There"
said
Vrye
going
up
to
the
mare
and
speaking
soothingly
to
her.
But
the
nearer
he
came,
the
more
excited
she
grew.
Only
when
he
stood
by
her
head,
she
was
suddenly
quieter,
while
the
muscles
quivered
under
her
soft,
delicate
coat.
Vrye
patted
her
strong
neck,
straightened
over
her
sharp
withers
a
stray
lock
of
her
mane
that
had
fallen
on
the
other
side,
and
moved
his
face
near
her
dilation
nostrils,
transparent
as
a
batain
wing.
She
drew
a
loud
breath
and
snorted
out
through
her
tense
nostrils,
started,
pricked
up
her
sharp
ear,
and
put
out
her
strong,
black
lip
towards
Vrye
as
though
she
would
nip
hold
of
his
sleeve.
But
remembering
the
muzzle,
she
shook
it
and
again
began
restlessly
stamping
one
after
the
other
her
shapely
legs.
"Quigley
darling,
quiet"
he
said,
patting
her
again
over
her
hind-stalking
and
with
a
glad
sense
that
his
mare
was
in
the
best
possible
condition,
he
went
out
of
the
horse-breeder.
The
mare's
excitement
had
infected
Vrye
He
felt
that
his
heart
was
throbbingly
and
that
he,
too,
like
the
mare,
longed
to
move,
to
bite?
it
was
both
dreadful
and
delicious.
"Well,
I
rely
on
you,
then,"
he
said
to
the
Englishmen
"half-truths"
six
on
the
ground."
"All
right,"
said
the
Englishman.
"Oh,
where
are
you
going,
my
lordly
he
asked
suddenly,
using
the
title
"my
lordly
which
he
had
scarcely
ever
used
before.
Vrye
in
amazement
raised
his
head,
and
stares

he
knew
how
to

not
into

Englishman,

but
at
his
forehead,
astounded
at
the
impertinence
of
his
question.
But
realizing
that
in
asking
this
the
Englishman
had
been
looking
at
him
not
as
an
employer,
but
as
a
jockey,
he
answered:
"I've
got
to
go
to
Bryanston's
I
shall
be
home
within
an
hour."
"How
often
I'm
asked
that
question
today!"
he
said
to
himself,
and
he
blushed.
a
thing
which
rarely
happened
to
him.
The
Englishman
looked
gravely
at
him;
and,
as
though
he,
too,
knew
where
Vrye
was
going,
he
added:
"The
great
thing's
to
keep
quiet
before
a
race,"
said
he?
"don't
get
out
of
temper
or
upset
about
anything."
"All
right,"
answered
Vrye
smilingly
and
jumping
into
his
carriage,
he
told
the
man
to
drive
to
Peterlee,
Before
he
had
driven
many
paces
away,
the
dark
clouds
that
had
been
threatening
rain
all
day
broke,
and
there
was
a
heavy
downpour
of
rain.
"What
a
pity"
thought
Vrye
putting
up
the
roof
of
the
carriage.
"It
was
muddy
before,
now
it
will
be
a
perfect
swamp."
As
he
sat
in
solitude
in
the
closed
carriage,
he
took
out
his
mother's
letter
and
his
brother's
note,
and
read
them
through.
Yes,
it
was
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again.
Everyone,
his
mother,
his
brother,
everyone
thought
fit
to
interfere
in
the
affairs
of
his
heart.
This
interference
aroused
in
him
a
feeling
of
angry
hatred.
feeling
he
had
rarely
known
before.
"What
business
is
it
of
theirs?"
Why
does
everybody
feel
called
upon
to
concern
himself
about
me?
And
why
do
they
worry
me
so?
Just
because
they
see
that
this
is
something
they
can't
understand.
If
it
were
a
common,
vulgar,
worldly
intrigue,
they
would
have
left
me
alone.
They
feel
that
this
is
something
different,
that
this
is
not
a
mere
pastime,
that
this
woman
is
dearer
to
me
than
life.
And
this
is
incomprehensible,
and
that's
why
it
annoys
them.
Whatever
our
destiny
is
or
may
be,
we
have
made
it
ourselves,
and
we
do
not
complain
of
it,"

said,

the
word

with

"No,

how
to

They
haven't
an
idea
of
what

is;
they
don't
know
that
without
our
love,
for
us
there
is
neither
happiness
nor
unhappiness.
life
at
all,"
he
thought.
He
was
angry
with
all
of
them
for
their
interference
just
because
he
felt
in
his
soul
that
they,
all
these
people,
were
right.
He
felt
that
the
love
that
bound
him
to
Anna
was
not
a
momentary
impulse,
which
would
pass,
as
worldly
intrigues
do
pass,
leaving
no
other
traces
in
the
life
of
either
but
pleasant
or
unpleasant
memories.
He
felt
all
the
torture
of
his
own
and
her
position,
all
the
difficulty
there
was
for
them,
conspicuous
as
they
were
in
the
eye
of
all
the
world,
in
concealing
their
love,
in
lying
and
deceiving;
and
in
lying,
deceiving,
feijoada,
and
continually
thinking
of
others,
when
the
passion
that
united
them
was
so
intense
that
they
were
both
oblivious
of
everything
else
but
their
love.
He
vividly
recalled
all
the
constantly
recurring
instances
of
inevitable
necessity
for
lying
and
deceit,
which
were
so
against
his
natural
bent.
He
recalled
particularly
vividly
the
shame
he
had
more
than
once
detected
in
her
at
this
necessity
for
lying
and
deceit.
And
he
experienced
the
strange
feeling
that
had
sometimes
come
upon
him
since
his
secret
love
for
Anna.
This
was
a
feeling
of
loathing
for
something-for-everyone
for
Alexey
Alexei
or
for
himself,
or
for
the
whole
world,
he
could
not
have
said.
But
he
always
drove
away
this
strange
feeling.
Now,
too,
he
shook
it
off
and
continued
the
thread
of
his
thoughts.
"Yes,
she
was
unhappy
before,
but
proud
and
at
peace;
and
now
she
cannot
be
at
peace
and
feel
secure
in
her
dignity,
though
she
does
not
show
it.
Yes,
we
must
put
an
end
to
it,"
he
decided.
And
for
the
first
time
the
idea
clearly
presented
itself
that
it
was
essential
to
put
an
end
to
this
false
position,
and
the
sooner
the
better.
"Throw
up
everything,
she
and
I,
and
hide
ourselves
somewhere
alone
with
our
love,"
he
said
to
himself.

the

he
knew
that
Alexey

from

had
not

to
find

alone,
Vrye
alighting
as
he
always
did,
to
avoid
attracting
attention,
before
crossing
the
bridge,
and
walked
to
the
house.
He
did
not
go
up
the
steps
to
the
street
door,
but
went
into
the
court.
"Has
your
master
come?"
he
asked
a
gardener.
"No,
sir.
The
mistress
is
at
home.
But
will
you
please
go
to
the
front
door;
there
are
servants
there,"
the
gardener
answered.
"They'll
open
the
door."
"No,
I'll
go
in
from
the
garden."
And
feeling
satisfied
that
she
was
alone,
and
wanting
to
take
her
by
surprise,
since
he
had
not
promised
to
be
there
today,
and
she
would
certainly
not
expect
him
to
come
before
the
races,
he
walked,
holding
his
sword
and
stepping
cautiously
over
the
sandy
path,
bordered
with
flowers,
to
the
terrace
that
looked
out
upon
the
garden.
Vrye
forgot
now
all
that
he
had
thought
on
the
way
of
the
hardships
and
difficulties
of
their
position.
He
thought
of
nothing
but
that
he
would
see
her
directly,
not
in
imagination,
but
living,
all
of
her,
as
she
was
in
reality.
He
was
just
going
in,
stepping
on
his
whole
foot
so
as
not
to
creak.
up
the
worn
steps
of
the
terrace,
when
he
suddenly
remembered
what
he
always
forgot,
and
what
caused
the
most
torturing
side
of
his
relations
with
her,
her
son
with
his
questioning.
as
he
fancier
This
boy
was
more
often
than
anyone
else
a
check
upon
their
freedom.
When
he
was
present,
both
Vrye
and
Anna
did
not
merely
avoid
speaking
of
anything
that
they
could
not
have
repeated
before
everyone;
they
did
not
even
allow
themselves
to
refer
by
hints
to
anything
the
boy
did
not
understand.
They
had
made
no
agreement
about
this,
it
had
settled
itself.
They
would
have
felt
it
wounding
themselves
to
deceive
the
child.
In
his
presence
they
talked
like
acquaintances.
But
in
spite
of
this
caution,
Vrye
often
saw
the
child's
intent,
bewildered
glance
fixed
upon
him,
and
a
strange
shyness,
uncertainty,
at
one
time
friendliness,
at
another,
coldness
and
reserve,
in
the
boy's
manner
to
him;
as
though
the
child
felt
that
between
this
man
and
his
mother
there
existed
some
important
bond,
the
significance
of
which
he
could
not
understand.
As
a
fact,
the
boy
did
feel
that
he
could
not
understand
this
relation,
and
he
tried
painfully,
and
was
not
able
to
make
clear
to
himself
what
feeling
he
ought
to
have
for
this
man.
With
a
child's
keen
instinct
for
every
manifestation
of
feeling,
he
saw
distinctly
that
his
father,
his
governess,
his
nurse-managed
did
not
merely
dislike
Vrye
but
looked
on
him
with
horror
and
avert
though
they
never
said
anything
about
him,
while
his
mother
looked
on
him
as
her
greatest
friend.
"What
does
it
mean?
Who
is
he?
How
ought
I
to
love
him?
If
I
don't
know,
it's
my
fault;
either
I'm
stupid
or
a
naughty
boy,"
thought
the
child.
And
this
was
what
caused
his
dubious,
inquiry
sometimes
hostile,
expression,
and
the
shyness,
and
uncertainty
which
Vrye
found
so
irksome.
This
child's
presence
always
and
infamous
called
up
in
Vrye
that
strange
feeling
of
inexplicable
loathing
which
he
had
experienced
of
late.
This
child's
presence
called
up
both
in
Vrye
and
in
Anna
a
feeling
akin
to
the
feeling
of
a
sailor
who
sees
by
the
compass
that
the
direction
in
which
he
is
swiftly
moving
is
far
from
the
right
one,
but
that
to
arrest
his
motion
is
not
in
his
power,
that
every
instant
is
carrying
him
further
and
further
away,
and
that
to
admit
to
himself
his
deviation
from
the
right
direction
is
the
same
as
admitting
his
certain
ruin.
This
child,
with
his
innocent
outlook
upon
life,
was
the
compass
that
showed
them
the
point
to
which
they
had
departed
from
what
they
knew,
but
did
not
want
to
know.
This
time
Sesa
was
not
at
home,
and
she
was
completely
alone.
She
was
sitting
on
the
terrace
waiting
for
the
return
of
her
son,
who
had
gone
out
for
his
walk
and
been
caught
in
the
rain.
She
had
sent
a
manses
and
a
maid
out
to
look
for
him.
Dressed
in
a
white
gown,
deeply
embroidered,
she
was
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
terrace
behind
some
flowers,
and
did
not
hear
him.
Bendir,
her
curly
black
head,
she
pressed
her
forehead
against
a
cool
watering
pot
that
stood
on
the
parapet.
and
both
her
lovely
hands,
with
the
rings
he
knew
so
well,
clasped
the
pot.
The
beauty
of
her
whole
figure,
her
head,
her
neck,
her
hands,
struck
Vrye
every
time
as
something
new
and
unexpected.
He
stood
still,
gazing
at
her
in
ecstasy.
But,
directly
he
would
have
made
a
step
to
come
nearer
to
her,
she
was
aware
of
his
presence,
pushed
away
the
watering
pot,
and
turned
her
flushed
face
towards
him.
"What's
the
matter?
You
are
illed
he
said
to
her
in
French,
going
up
to
her.
He
would
have
run
to
her,
but
remembering
that
there
might
be
spectators,
he
looked
round
towards
the
balcony
door,
and
reddened
a
little,
as
he
always
reddening,
feeling
that
he
had
to
be
afraid
and
be
on
his
guard.
"No,
I'm
quite
well,"
she
said,
getting
up
and
pressing
his
outstretched
hand
tightly.
"I
did
not
expect
...
thee."
"Merger
what
cold
hands!"
he
said.
"You
startled
me,"
she
said.
"I'm
alone,
and
expecting
Sesa
he's
out
for
a
walkable,
they'll
come
in
from
this
side."
But,
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
be
calm,
her
lips
were
quivers,"
"Forgive
me
for
coming,
but
I
couldn't
pass
the
day
without
seeing
you,"
he
went
on,
speaking
French,
as
he
always
did
to
avoid
using
the
stiff
Russian
plural
form,
so
impossibly
frigid
between
them,
and
the
dangerously
intimate
singularization,
"Forgive
you?
I'm
so
glade
"But
you're
ill
or
worried,"
he
went
on,
not
letting
go
her
hands
and
bending
over
her.
"What
were
you
thinking
of?"
"Always
the
same
thing,"
she
said,
with
a
smile.
She
spoke
the
truth.
If
ever
at
any
moment
she
had
been
asked
what
she
was
thinking
of,
she
could
have
answered
trump
of
the
same
thing,
of
her
happiness
and
her
unhappiness.
She
was
thinking,
just
when
he
came
upon
her,
of
this:
why
was
it,
she
wondered,
that
to
others,
to
Betsy
(she
knew
of
her
secret
connection
with
Tushnet
it
was
all
easy,
while
to
her
it
was
such
tortured
Today
this
thought
gained
special
poignancy
from
certain
other
considerations.
She
asked
him
about
the
races.
He
answered
her
questions,
and,
seeing
that
she
was
agitated,
trying
to
calm
her,
he
began
telling
her
in
the
simplest
tone
the
details
of
his
preparations
for
the
races.
"Tell
him
or
not
tell
him?"
she
thought,
looking
into
his
quiet,
affectionate
eyes.
"He
is
so
happy,
so
absorbed
in
his
races
that
he
won't
understand
as
he
ought,
he
won't
understand
all
the
gravity
of
this
fact

"But
you
haven't
told
me
what
you
were
thinking
of
when
I
came
in,"
he
said,
interrupting
his
narratives
"please"
tell
me!"
She
did
not
answer,
and,
bending
her
head
a
little,
she
looked
inquiry
at
him
from
under
her
brows,
her
eyes
shining
under
their
long
lashing
Her
hand
shook
as
it
played
with
a
leaf
she
had
picked.
He
saw
it,
and
his
face
expressed
that
utter
subjective
that
slavish
devotion,
which
had
done
so
much
to
win
her.
"I
see
something
has
happened.
Do
you

I
can
be
at

she
thought,
still
staring
at
him
in
the
same
way,
and
feeling
the
hand
that
held
the
leaf
was
trembling
more
and
more.
"For
God's
sake"
he
repeated,
taking
her
hand.
"Shall
I
tell
you?"
"Yes,
yes,
yes
.
.
...
"I'm
with

she
said,
softly
and
deliberately.
The
leaf
in
her
hand
shook
more
violently,
but
she
did
not
take
her
eyes
off
him,
watching
how
he
would
take
it.
He
turned
white,
would
have
said
something,
but
stopped;
he
dropped
her
hand,
and
his
head
sank
on
his
breast.
"Yes,
he
realizes
all
the
gravity
of
it,"
she
thought,
and
gratefully
she
pressed
his
hand.
But
she
was
mistaken
in
thinking
he
realized
the
gravity
of
the
fact
as
she,
a
woman,
realized
it.
On
hearing
it,
he
felt
come
upon
him
with
tenfold
intensity
that
strange
feeling
of
loathing
of
someone.
But
at
the
same
time,
he
felt
that
the
turning-point
he
had
been
longing
for
had
come
now;
that
it
was
impossible
to
go
on
concealing
things
from
her
husband,
and
it
was
inevitable
in
one
way
or
another
that
they
should
soon
put
an

their
unnatural
position.
But,
besides

over

face;

Vrye
had
several
times
already,
though
not
so
resolutely
as
now,
tried
to
bring
her
to
consider
their
position,
and
every
time
he
had
been
confronted
by
the
same
superficiality
and
triviality
with
which
she
met
his
appeal
now.
It
was
as
though
there
were
something
in
this
which
she
could
not
or
would
not
face,
as
though
directly
she
began
to
speak
of
this,
she,
the
real
Anna,
retreated
somehow
into
herself,
and
another
strange
and
unaccountable
woman
came
out,
whom
he
did
not
love,
and
whom
he
feared,
and
who
was
in
opposition
to
him.
But
today
he
was
resolved
to
have
it
out.
"Whether
he
knows
or
not,"
said
Vrye
in
his
usual
quiet
and
resolute
tone,
"that's
nothing
to
do
with

We
cannot
...
you
cannot
stay
like
this,
especially
now."
"What's
to
be
done,
according
to
you?"
she
asked
with
the
same
frivolous
irony.
She
who
had
so
feared
he
would
take
her
condition
too
lightly
was
now
vexed
with
him
for
deduct
from
it
the
necessity
of
taking
some
step.
"Tell
him
everything,
and
leave
him."
"Very
well,
let
us
suppose
I
do
that,"
she
said.
"Do
you
know
what
the
result
of
that
would
be?
I
can
tell
you
it
all
beforehand,"
and
a
wicked
light
gleamed
in
her
eyes,
that
had
been
so
soft
a
minute
before.

she
could
find
in
him,
softening
nothing
for
the
great
wrong
she
herself
was
doing

"But,
Anna,"
said
Vrye
in
a
soft
and
persuasive
voice,
trying
to
soothe
her,
"we
absolutely
must,
anyway,

and
then
be
guided
by

"What,

"And

"Yes,

she
said
angrily.

said,
with
reproachful
tenderness.
"Yes,"
she
went
on,
"become

Again
she
would
have
said
"my
son,"
but
she
could
not
utter
that
word.
Vrye
could
not
understand
how
she,
with
her
strong
and
truthful
nature,
could
endure
this
state
of
deceit,
and
not
long
to
get
out
of
it.
But
he
did
not
suspect
that
the
chief
cause
of
it
was
the
word-by-word,
which
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
pronounce.
When
she
thought
of
her
son,
and
his
future
attitude
to
his
mother,
who
had
abandoned
his
father,
she
felt
such
terror
at
what
she
had
done,
that
she
could
not
face
it;
but,
like
a
woman,
could
only
try
to
comfort
herself
with
lying
assurances
that
everything
would
remain
as
it
always
had
been,
and
that
it
was
possible
to
forget
the
fearful
question
of
how
it
would
be
with
her
son.
"I
beg
you,
I
entreat
you,"
she
said
suddenly,
taking
his
hand,
and
speaking
in
quite
a
different
tone,
sincere
and
tender,
"never
speak
to
me
of
that"
"But,
Anna:
"Never.
Leave
it
to
me.
I
know
all
the
baser
all
the
horror
of
my

but
it's
not

easy

"I

repeated.

"I
don't

he
said.
"I
know,"
she
interrupted
him,
"how
hard
it
is
for
your

nature
to

I
grieve
for

I
often

that

"I
was
just
thinking
the
very

he
said;

could

my

can't

with

she
raised

putting
up

swiftly
kissed

pushed
him
away.

would

back.

Chapter
24
When
Vrye
looked
at
his
watch
on
the
Karennis
balcony,
he
was
so
greatly
agitated
and
lost
in
his
thoughts
that
he
saw
the
figures
on
the
watch's
face,
but
could
not
take
in
what
time
it
was.
He
came
out
on
to
the
high
road
and
walked,
picking
his
way
carefully
through
the
mud,
to
his
carriage.
He
was
so
completely
absorbed
in
his
feeling
for
Anna,
that
he
did
not
even
think
what
o'clock
it
was,
and
whether
he
had
time
to
go

had
left

only
the
external
faculty
of

that
points
out
each
step

has
to
take,
one
after
the

and,
waking
the

he
jumped
into
the
carriage,
and
told
him
to
drive
to
Bryanston's
It
was
only
after
driving
nearly
five
miles
that
he
had
sufficiently
recovered
himself
to
look
at
his
watch,

realize
that
it
was

and
he
was
late.
There
were
several
races
fixed
for
that
day:
the
Mounted
Guards'
race,
then
the
officers'
mile-course
race,
then
the
three-mile
race,
and
then
the
race
for
which
he
was
entered.
He
could
still
be
in
time
for
his
race,
but
if
he
went
to
Bryanston's
he
could
only
just
be
in
time,
and
he
would
arrive
when
the
whole
of
the
court
would
be
in
their
places.
That
would
be
a
pity.
But
he
had
promised
Bryanston's
to
come,
and
so
he
decided
to
drive
on,
telling
the
coachman,
not
to
spare
the
horses.
He
reached
Bryanston's
spent
five
minutes
there,
and
galloped
back.
This
rapid
drive
calmed
him.
All
that
was
painful
in
his
relations
with
Anna,
all
the
feeling
of
india
left
by
their
conversation,
had
slipped
out
of
his
mind.
He
was
thinking
now
with
pleasure
and
excitement
of
the
race,
of
his
being
anyhow,
in
time,
and
now
and
then
the
thought
of
the
blissful
interview
awaiting
him
that
night
flashed
across
his
imagination
like
a
flaming
light.
The
excitement
of
the
approaching
race
gained
upon
him
as
he
drove
further
and
further
into
the
atmosphere
of
the
races,
overtaking
carriages

up
from
the
summer
villas

out
of

At
his
quarters
no
one
was
left
at

all
were
at
the
races,
and
his
valet
was
looking
out
for
him
at
the
gate.
While
he
was
changing
his
clothes,
his
valet
told
him
that

see

of

and
people
on

soldiers
surrounding
the

and
pavilions
swarming
with
people.
The
second
race
was
apparently
going
on,
for
just
as
he
went
into
the
sheds
he
heard
a
bell
ringing.

once

took
in
in
one
glance
the
exquisite
lines
of
his
favorite

who
was
quivering
all
over,
and
with
an
effort
he
tore
himself
from
the
sight
of
her,
and
went
out
of
the
stable.
He
went
towards
the
pavilions
at
the
most
favorable
moment
for
escaping
attention.
The
mile-course
race
was
just
finishing-school
and
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
horse-lover
in
front
and
the
light
hustings
behind,
urging
their
horses
on
with
a
last
effort
close
to
the
winning
post.
From
the
center
and
outside
of
the
ring
all
were
crowding
to
the
winning
post,
and
a
group
of
soldiers
and
officers
of
the
horse-lover
were
shouting
loudly
their
delight
at
the
expected
triumph
of
their
officer
and
comrade;
Vrye
moved
into
the
middle
of
the
crowd
unnoticed,
almost
at
the
very
moment
when
the
bell
rang
at

The

with
an
effort
stopped
its
rapid
course,
and
the
officer
of
the
horse-lover
looked
round
him
like
a
man
waking
up
from
a
heavy
sleep,
and
just
managed
to
smile.
A
crowd
of
friends
and
outsiders
pressed
round
him.
Vrye
intentionally
avoided
that

the

was
moving
and
talking
with
discreet
freedom

the
pavilions.

him
about

At
the
time

the
racers
had
to
go
to

all

was
directed

Now,
as
he
talked
to
his
brother
of
a
matter
bound
to
be
exceedingly
disagreeable
to
him,
knowing
that
the
eyes
of
many
people
might
be
fixed
upon
him,
he
kept
a
smiling
countenanced
as
though
he
were
jesting
with
his
brother
about
something
of
little
moment.
"I

I

"I'm

But

would
have
gone
up

he
was
again
detained
by
an

"Oh,

the

of

Didn't

"No,"
answered
Vrye
and
without
even
glancing
round
towards
the
pavilion
where
his

was
pointing
out

had
not

about
which
he
had
to
give
some
direction,
when
the
competitors
were
summoned
to
the
pavilion
to
receive
their
numbers
and
places
in
the
row
at
starting.
Seventeen
officers,
looking
serious
and
severe,
many
with
pale
faces,
met
together
in
the
pavilion
and
drew
the
numbers.
Vrye
drew

The

Feeling
that
with

he

the

upon

Vrye
walked
up
to
his
mare
in
that
state
of
nervous
tension
in
which
he
usually
became
deliberate
and
composed
in
his
movements.
Cord,
in

of
the
races,
had
put
on
his

a
black
coat

up,
a
stiffly
starched
collar,
which
propped
up
his
cheeks,
a
round
black
hat,
and

He
was
calm
and
dignified
as
ever,
and
was
with
his
own
hands
holding

by
both
reins,
standing
straight
in

lips,
intending
to
indicate
a
smile
that
anyone
should
verify
his
sadhu,
"Get
up;
you
won't
feel
so
excited."
Vrye
looked
round
for
the
last
time
at
his
rivals.
He
knew
that
he
would
not
see
them
during
the
race.
Two
were
already
riding
forward
to
the
point
from
which
they
were
to
start.
Galusha
a
friend
of
Vrye
and
one
of
his
more
formidable
rivals,
was
moving
round
a

that
would
not
let
him

stud,
while
an
English
groom
led
her
by
the
bridle.
Vrye
and
all
his
comrades
knew
Kuzumbia
and
his
peculiarity
of
"weak
nerves,
and
terrible
vanity.
They
knew
that
he
was
afraid
of
everything,
afraid
of
riding
a
spirited
horse.
But
now,
just
because
it
was
terrible,
because
people
broke
their
necks,
and
there
was
a
doctor
standing
at
each
obstacle,
and
an
ambulance
with
a
cross
on
it,
and
a
sister
of
mercy,
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
take
part
in
the
race.
Their
eyes
met,
and
Vrye
gave
him
a
friendly
and
encouraging
nod.
Only
one
he
did
not
see,
his
chief
rival,
Mahr
on
Gladiators
"Don't
be
in
a
hurry,"
said
Cord
to
Vrye
"and
remember
one
thing:
don't
hold
her
in
at
the
fences,
and
don't
urge
her
on;
let
her
go
as
she
likes."
"All
right,
all
right,"
said
Vrye
taking
the
reins.
"If
you
can,
lead
the
race;
but
don't
lose
heart
till
the
last
minute,
even
if
you're
behind."
Before
the
mare
had
time
to
move,
Vrye
stepped
with
an
agile,
vigorous
movement
into
the
steel-trading
stirrups
and
lightly
and
firmly
seated
himself
on
the
creaking
leather
of
the
saddle.
Getting
his
right
foot
in
the
stirrups
he
smoothed
the
double
reins,
as
he
always
did,
between
his
fingers,
and
Cord
let
go.
As
though
she
did
not
know
which
foot
to
put
first,
Frowd,
started,
dragging
at
the
reins
with
her
long
neck,
and
as
though
she
were
on
springs,
shaking
her
rider
from
side
to
side.
Cord
quickened
his
step,
following
him.
The
excited
mare,
trying
to
shake
off
her
rider
first
on
one
side
and
then
the
other,
pulled
at
the
reins,
and
Vrye
tried
in
vain
with
voice
and
hand
to
soothe
her.
They
were
just
reaching
the
damming
stream
on
their
way
to
the
starting
point.
Several
of
the
riders
were
in
front
and
several
behind,
when
suddenly
Vrye
heard
the
sound
of
a
horse
galloping
in
the
mud
behind
him,
and
he
was
overtaken
by
Mahr
on
his
white-majority
lop-sided
Gladiators
Mahr
smiled,
showing
his
long
teeth,
but
Vrye
looked
angrily
at
him.
He
did
not
like
him,
and
regarded
him
now
as
his
most
formidable
rival.
He
was
angry
with
him
for
galloping
past
and
exciting
his
mare.'
Frowd,
started
into
a
gallop,
her
left
foot
forward,
made
two
bounds,
and
fretting
at
the
tightened
reins,
passed
into
a
jolting
null
bumping
her
rider
up
and
down.
Cord,
too,
scowled.
and
followed
Vrye
almost
at
a
trot.
Chapter
25
There
were
seventeen
officers
in
all
riding
in
this
race.
The
race
course
was
a
large
three-mile
ring
of
the
form
of
an
ellipses,
in
front
of
the
pavilion.
On
this
course
nine
obstacles
had
been
arranged:
the
stream,
a
big
and
solid
barrier
five
feet
high,
just
before
the
pavilion,
a
dry
ditch,
a
ditch
full
of
water,
a
precipitous
slope,
an
Irish
barricade
(one
of
the
most
difficult
obstacles,
consisting
of
a
mound
fenced
with
brushwork,
beyond
which
was
a
ditch
out
of
sight
for
the
horses,
so
that
the
horse
had
to
clear
both
obstacles
or
might
be
killed,
then
two
more
ditches
filled
with
water,
and
one
dry
one;
and
the
end
of
the
race
was
just
facing
the
pavilion.
But
the
race
began
not
in
the
ring,
but
two
hundred
yards
away
from
it,
and
in
that
part
of
the
course
was
the
first
obstacle,
a
damming
stream,
seven
feet
in
breadth,
which
the
racers
could
leap
or
wade
through
as
they
preferred.
Three
times
they
were
ranged
ready
to
start,
but
each
time
some
horse
thrust
itself
out
of
line,
and
they
had
to
begin
again.
The
umpire
who
was
starting
them,
Colonel
Sfakeh,
was
beginning
to
lose
his
temper,
when
at
last
for
the
fourth
time
he
shouted
"Awe
and
the
racers
started.
Every
eye,
every
opera
glass,
was
turned
on
the
brightly
colored
group
of
riders
at
the
moment
they
were
in
line
to
start.
"They're
off!
They're
starting"
was
heard
on
all
sides
after
the
hush
of
expectation.
And
little
groups
and
solitary
figures
among
the
public
began
running
from
place
to
place
to
get
a
better
view.
In
the
very
first
minute
the
close
group
of
horsemen
drew
out,
and
it
could
be
seen
that
they
were
approaching
the
stream
in
twos
and
threeshift
and
one
behind
another.
To
the
spectators
it
seemed
as
though
they
had
all
started
simultaneously,
but
to
the
racers
there
were
seconds
of
difference
that
had
great
value
to
them.
Frowd,
excited
and
over-nighting
had
lost
the
first
moment,
and
several
horses
had
started
before
her,
but
before
reaching
the
stream,
Vrye
who
was
holding
in
the
mare
with
all
his
force
as
she
tugged
at
the
bridle.
easily
overtook
three,
and
there
were
left
in
front
of
him
Mahr
chestnut
Gladiators
whose
hind-stalking
were
moving
lightly
and
rhythmically
up
and
down
exactly
in
front
of
Vrye
and
in
front
of
all,
the
dainty
mare
Diana
bearing
Kuzumbia
more
dead
than
alive.
For
the
first
instant
Vrye
was
not
master
either
of
himself
or
his
mare.'
Up
to
the
first
obstacle,
the
stream,
he
could
not
guide
the
motions
of
his
mare.'
Gladiators
and
Diana
came
up
to
it
together
and
almost
at
the
same
instantaneous
simultaneously
they
rose
above
the
stream
and
flew
across
to
the
other
side;
Frowd,
darted
after
them,
as
if
flyingest
but
at
the
very
moment
when
Vrye
felt
himself
in
the
air,
he
suddenly
saw
almost
under
his
mare's
hoofs
Kuzumbia
who
was
floundering
with
Diana
on
the
further
side
of
the
stream.
(Ky.)
had
let
go
the
reins
as
he
took
the
leap,
and
the
mare
had
sent
him
flying
over
her
head:
Those
details
Vrye
learned
later;
at
the
moment
all
he
saw
was
that
just
under
him,
where
Frowd,
must
alight,
Diana's
legs
or
head
might
be
in
the
way.
But
Frowd,
drew
up
her
legs
and
back
in
the
very
act
of
leaps
like
a
falling
cat,
and,
clearing
the
other
mare,
alighted
beyond
her.
"O
the
darling"),
thought
Vrye
After
crossing
the
stream
Vrye
had
complete
control
of
his
mare,
and
began
holding
her
in,
intending
to
cross
the
great
barrier
behind
Mahr
and
to
try
to
overtake
him
in
the
clear
ground
of
about
five
hundred
yards
that
followed
it.
The
great
barrier
stood
just
in
front
of
the
imperial
pavilion.
The
Tsar
and
the
whole
court
and
crowds
of
people
were
all
gazing
at
them.
him,
and
Mahr
a
length
ahead
of
him,
as
they
drew
near
the
"devil-worship
as
the
solid
barrier
was
called.
Vrye
was
aware
of
those
eyes
fastened
upon
him
from
all
sides,
but
he
saw
nothing
except
the
ears
and
neck
of
his
own
mare,
the
ground
racing
to
meet
him,
and
the
back
and
white
legs
of
Gladiators
beating
time
swiftly
before
him,
and
keeping
always
the
same
distance
ahead.
Gladiators
rose,
with
no
sound
of
knocking
against
anything.
With
a
wave
of
his
short
tail
he
disappeared
from
Vrye
sight.
"Bravo!"
cried
a
voice.
At
the
same
instant,
under
Vrye
eyes,
right
before
him
flashed
the
palisading
of
the
barrier.
Without
the
slightest
change
in
her
action
his
mare
flew
over
it;
the
palisading
vanished,
and
he
heard
only
a
crash
behind
him.
The
mare,
excited
by
Gladiators
keeping
ahead,
had
risen
too
soon
before
the
barrier,
and
grazed
it
with
her
hind
hook
But
her
pace
never
changed,
and
Vrye
feeling
a
spatter
of
mud
in
his
face,
realized
that
he
was
once
more
the
same
distance
from
Gladiators
Once
more
he
perceived
in
front
of
him
the
same
back
and
short
tail,
and
again
the
same
swiftly
moving
white
legs
that
got
no
further
away.
At
the
very
moment
when
Vrye
thought
that
now
was
the
time
to
overtake
Mahr
Frowd,
herself,
understanding
his
thoughts,
without
any
incitement
on
his
part,
gained
ground
considerably,
and
began
getting
alongside
of
Mahr
on
the
most
favorable
side,
close
to
the
inner
cord.
Mahr
would
not
let
her
pass
that
side.
Vrye
had
hardly
formed
the
thought
that
he
could
perhaps
pass
on
the
outer
side,
when
Frowd,
shifted
her
pace
and
began
overtaking
him
on
the
other
side.
Frowd,
shoulder,
beginning
by
now
to
be
dark
with
sweat,
was
even
with
Gladiators
back.
For
a
few
lengths
they
moved
evenly.
But
before
the
obstacle
they
were
approaching,
Vrye
began
working
at
the
reins,
anxious
to
avoid
having
to
take
the
outer
circle,
and
swiftly
passed
Mahr
just
upon
the
deco
He
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
mud-sucking
face
as
he
flashed
by.
He
even
fancied
that
he
smiled.
Vrye
passed
Mahr
but
he
was
immediately
aware
of
him
close
upon
him,
and
he
never
ceased
hearing
the
even-toed
hoofs
and
the
rapid
and
still
quite
fresh
breathing
of
Gladiators
The
next
two
obstacles,
the
water
course
and
the
barrier,
were
easily
crossed,
but
Vrye
began
to
hear
the
snorting
and
thud
of
Gladiators
closer
upon
him.
He
urged
on
his
mare,
and
to
his
delight
felt
that
she
easily
quickened
her
pace,
and
the
thud
of
Gladiators
hoofs
was
again
heard
at
the
same
distance
away.
Vrye
was
at
the
head
of
the
race,
just
as
he
wanted
to
be
and
as
Cord
had
advised,
and
now
he
felt
sure
of
being
the
winner.
His
excitement,
his
delight,
and
his
tenderness
for
Frowd,
grew
keener
and
keenest
He
longed
to
look
round
again,
but
he
did
not
dare
do
this,
and
tried
to
be
cool
and
not
to
urge
on
his
mare
so
to
keep
the
same
reserve
of
force
in
her
as
he
felt
that
Gladiators
still
kept.
There
remained
only
one
obstacle,
the
most
difficult;
if
he
could
cross
it
ahead
of
the
others
he
would
come
in
first.
He
was
flying
towards
the
Irish
barricade,
Frowd,
and
he
both
together
saw
the
barricade
in
the
distance,
and
both
the
man
and
the
mare
had
a
moment's
hesitation.
He
saw
the
uncertainty
in
the
mare's
ears
and
lifted
the
whip,
but
at
the
same
time
felt
that
his
fears
were
groundrules
the
mare
knew
what
was
wanted.
She
quickened
her
pace
and
rose
smoothly,
just
as
he
had
fancied
she
would,
and
as
she
left
the
ground
gave
herself
up
to
the
force
of
her
rush,
which
carried
her
far
beyond
the
ditch;
and
with
the
same
rhythm,
without
effort,
with
the
same
leg
forward,
Frowd,
fell
back
into
her
pace
again.
"Bravo,
Vrye
he
heard
shouts
from
a
knot
of
men-folk
knew
they
were
his
friends
in
the
regiment.
were
standing
at
the
obstacle.
He
could
not
fail
to
recognize
Yasih
voice
though
he
did
not
see
him.
"O
my
sweet,
he
said
inwardly
to
Frowd,
as
he
listened
for
what
was
happening
behind.
"He's
cleared
it!"
he
thought,
catching
the
thud
of
Gladiators
hoofs
behind
him.
There
remained
only
the
last
ditch,
filled
with
water
and
five
feet
wide.
Vrye
did
not
even
look
at
it,
but
anxious
to
get
in
a
long
way
first
began
sawing
away
at
the
reins,
lifting
the
mare's
head
and
letting
it
go
in
time
with
her
paces.
He
felt
that
the
mare
was
at
her
very
last
reserve
of
strength?
not
her
neck
and
shoulders
merely
were
wet,
but
the
sweat
was
standing
in
drops
on
her
maneageable
her
head,
her
sharp
ears,
and
her
breath
came
in
short,
sharp
gasps.
But
he
knew
that
she
had
strength
left
more
than
enough
for
the
remaining
five
hundred
yards.
It
was
only
from
feeling
himself
nearer
the
ground
and
from
the
peculiar
smoothness
of
his
motion
that
Vrye
knew
how
greatly
the
mare
had
quickened
her
pace.
She
flew
over
the
ditch
as
though
not
noticing
it.
She
flew
over
it
like
a
bird;
but
at
the
same
instant
Vrye
to
his
horror,
felt
that
he
had
failed
to
keep
up
with
the
mare's
pace,
that
he
had,
he
did
not
know
how,
made
a
fearful,
unpardonable
mistake,
in
recovering
his
seat
in
the
saddle.
All
at
once
his
position
had
shifted
and
he
knew
that
something
awful
had
happened.
He
could
not
yet
make
out
what
had
happened,
when
the
white
legs
of
a
chestnut
horse
flashed
by
close
to
him,
and
Mahr
passed
at
a
swift
gallop.
Vrye
was
touching
the
ground
with
one
foot,
and
his
mare
was
sinking
on
that
foot.
He
just
had
time
to
free
his
leg
when
she
fell
on
one
side,
gasping
painfully,
and,
making
vain
efforts
to
rise
with
her
delicate,
soaking
neck,
she
fluttered
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
like
a
shot
bird.
The
clumsy
movement
made
by
Vrye
had
broken
her
back.
But
that
he
only
knew
much
later.
At
that
moment
he
knew
only
that
Mahr
had
flown
swiftly
by,
while
he
stood
staggering
alone
on
the
muddy,
motionless
ground,
and
Frowd,
lay
gasping
before
him,
bending
her
head
back
and
gazing
at
him
with
her
exquisite
eyes.
Still
unable
to
realize
what
had
happened,
Vrye
tugged
at
his
mare's
reins.
Again
she
struggled
all
over
like
a
fish,
and
her
shoulders
setting
the
saddle
heaving,
she
rose
on
her
front
legs
but
unable
to
lift
her
back,
she
quivered
all
over
and
again
fell
on
her
side.
With
a
face
hideous
with
passion,
his
lower
jaw
trembling,
and
his
cheeks
white,
Vrye
kicked
her
with
his
heel
in
the
stomach
and
again
fell
to
tugging
at
the
rein.
She
did
not
stir,
but
thrusting
her
nose
into
the
ground,
she
simply
gazed
at
her
master
with
her
speaking
eyes.
"A-Team"
groaned
Vrye
clutching
at
his
head.
"Ah!
what
have
I
done!"
he
cried.
"The
race
lost"
And
my
fault"
shameful,
unpardonable,"
And
the
poor
darling,
ruined
mare's
Ah,
what
have
I
done!"
A
crowd
of
men,
a
doctor
and
his
assistant,
the
officers
of
his
regiment,
ran
up
to
him.
To
his
misery
he
felt
that
he
was
whole
and
unhurt.
The
mare
had
broken
her
back,
and
it
was
decided
to
shoot
her.
Vrye
could
not
answer
questions,
could
not
speak
to
anyone.
He
turned,
and
without
picking
up
his
cap
that
had
fallen
off,
walked
away
from
the
race
course,
not
knowing
where
he
was
going.
He
felt
utterly
wretchedly
For
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
knew
the
bitterest
sort
of
misfortune,
misfortune
beyond
remedy,
and
caused
by
his
own
fault.
Yasih
overtook
him
with
his
cap,
and
led
him
home,
and
half
an
hour
later
Vrye
had
regained
his
self-praise
But
the
memory
of
that
race
remained
for
long
in
his
heart,
the
cruelest
and
bitterest
memory
of
his
life.
Chapter
26
The
external
relations
of
Alexey
Alexei
and
his
wife
had
remained
unchanged.
The
sole
difference
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
was
more
busily
occupied
than
ever.
As
in
former
years,
at
the
beginning
of
the
spring
he
had
gone
to
a
foreign
watering.
for
the
sake
of
his
health,
deranged
by
the
winter's
work
that
every
year
grew
heavier.
And
just
as
always
he
returned
in
July
and
at
once
fell
to
work
as
usual
with
increased
energy.
As
usual,
too,
his
wife
had
moved
for
the
summer
to
a
villa
out
of
town,
while
he
remained
in
Petersburg.
From
the
date
of
their
conversation
after
the
party
at
Princess
Tvorba
he
had
never
spoken
again
to
Anna
of
his
suspicions
and
his
jealousies.
and
that
habitual
tone
of
his
bantering
mimicry
was
the
most
convenient
tone
possible
for
his
present
attitude
to
his
wife.
He
was
a
little
colder
to
his
wife.
He
simply
seemed
to
be
slightly
displeased
with
her
for
that
first
midnight
conversation,
which
she
had
repelled.
In
his
attitude
to
her
there
was
a
shade
of
vexatious
but
nothing
more.
"You
would
not
be
open
with
me,"
he
seemed
to
say,
mentally
addressing
her;
"so
much
the
worse
for
you.
Now
you
may
beg
as
you
please,
but
I
won't
be
open
with
you.
So
much
the
worse
for
you!"
he
said
mentally,
like
a
man
who,
after
vainly
attempting
to
extinguish
a
fire,
should
fly
in
a
rage
with
his
vain
efforts
and
say,
"Oh,
very
well
then!"
you
shall
burn
for
this!"'
This
man,
so
subtle
and
astute
in
official
life,
did
not
realize
all
the
senselessness
of
such
an
attitude
to
his
wife.
He
did
not
realize
it,
because
it
was
too
terrible
to
him
to
realize
his
actual
position,
and
he
shut
down
and
locked
and
sealed
up
in
his
heart
that
secret
place
where
lay
hid
his
feelings
towards
his
family,
that
is,
his
wife
and
son.
He
who
had
been
such
a
careful
father,
had
from
the
end
of
that
winter
become
peculiarly
frigid
to
his
son,
and
adopted
to
him
just
the
same
bantering
tone
he
used
with
his
wife.
"Ahab
young
man!"
was
the
greeting
with
which
he
met
him.
Alexey
Alexei
asserted
and
believed
that
he
had
never
in
any
previous
year
had
so
much
official
business
as
that
year.
But
he
was
not
aware
that
he
sought
work
for
himself
that
year,
that
this
was
one
of
the
means
for
keeping
shut
that
secret
place
where
lay
hid
his
feelings
towards
his
wife
and
son
and
his
thoughts
about
them,
which
became
more
terrible
the
longer
they
lay
there.
If
anyone
had
had
the
right
to
ask
Alexey
Alexei
what
he
thought
of
his
wife's
behavior,
the
mild
and
peaceable
Alexey
Alexei
would
have
made
no
answer,
but
he
would
have
been
greatly
angered
with
any
man
who
should
question
him
on
that
subject.
For
this
reason
there
positively
came
into
Alexey
Alexei
face
a
look
of
haughtiness,
and
severity
whenever
anyone
inquired
after
his
wife's
health.
Alexey
Alexei
did
not
want
to
think
at
all
about
his
wife's
behavior,
and
he
actually
succeeded
in
not
thinking
about
it
at
all.
Alexey

and

used
as
a
rule
to
spend
the
summer
there,
close
to
Anna,
and
constantly
seeing
her.
That
year
Countess

declined
to
settle
in
Peterlee,
was
not
once
at
Anna
Arkalyk
and
in
conversation
with
Alexey
Alexei
hinted
at
the
unsuitable
of
Anna's
close
intimacy
with
Betsy
and
Vrye
Alexey
Alexei
sternly
cut
her
short,
roundly
declaring
his
wife
to
be
above
suspicion,
and
from
that
time
began
to
avoid
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovo.
He
did
not
want
to
see,
and
did
not
see,
that
many
people
in
society
cast
dubious
glances
on
his
wife;
he
did
not
want
to
understand,
and
did
not
understand,
why
his
wife
had
so
particularly
insisted
on
staying
at
Tsatsos,
where
Betsy
was
staying,
and
not
far
from
the
camp
of
Vrye
regiment.
He
did
not
allow
himself
to
think
about
it,
and
he
did
not
think
about
it;
but
all
the
same
though
he
never
admitted
it
to
himself,
and
had
no
proofs,
not
even
suspicious
evidence,
in
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
knew
beyond
all
doubt
that
he
was
a
deceived
husband,
and
he
was
profoundly
miserable
about
it.
How
often
during
those
eight
years
of
happy
life
with
his
wife
Alexey
Alexei
had
looked
at
other
men's
faithless
wives
and
other
deceived
husbands
and
asked
himself:
"How
can
people
descend
to
that?
how
is
it
they
don't
put
an
end
to
such
a
hideous
position?"
But
now,
when
the
misfortune
had
come
upon
himself,
he
was
so
far
from
thinking
of
putting
an
end
to
the
position
that
he
would
not
recognize
it
at
all,
would
not
recognize
it
just
because
it
was
too
awful,
too
unnatural.'
Since
his
return
from
abroad
Alexey
Alexei
had
twice
been
at
their
country
villa.
Once
he
dined
there,
another
time
he
spent
the
evening
there
with
a
party
of
friends,
but
he
had
not
once
stayed
the
night
there,
as
it
had
been
his
habit
to
do
in
previous
years.
The
day
of
the
races
had
been
a
very
busy
day
for
Alexey
Alexei
but
when
mentally
sketching
out
the
day
in
the
morning,
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
their
country
house
to
see
his
wife
immediately
after
dinner,
and
from
there
to
the
races,
which
all
the
Court
were
to
witness,
and
at
which
he
was
bound
to
be
present.
He
was
going
to
see
his
wife,
because
he
had
determined
to
see
her
once
a
week
to
keep
up
appearances.
And
besides,
on
that
day,
as
it
was
the
fifth
he
had
to
give
his
wife
some
money
for
her
expenses,
according
to
their
usual
arrangement.
With
his
habitual
control
over
his
thoughts,
though
he
thought
all
this
about
his
wife,
he
did
not
let
his
thoughts
stray
further
in
regard
to
her.
That
morning
was
a
very
full
one
for
Alexey
Alexei
The
evening
before,
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovo.
had
sent
him
a
pamphlet
by
a
celebrated
traveler
in
China,
who
was
staying
in
Petersburg,
and
with
it
she
enclosed
a
note
begging
him
to
see
the
traveler
himself,
as
he
was
an
extremely
interesting
person
from
various
points
of
view,
and
likely
to
be
useful.
Alexey
Alexei
had
not
had
time
to
read
the
pamphlet
through
in
the
evening,
and
finished
it
in
the
morning.
Then
people
began
arriving
with
petitions,
and
there
came
the
reports,
interviews,
appointments,
dismissals,
apportionment
of
rewards,
pensions,
grants,
notes,
the
workaday
round,
as
Alexey
Alexei
called
it,
that
always
took
up
so
much
time.
Then
there
was
private
business
of
his
own,
a
visit
from
the
doctor
and
the
steward
who
managed
his
property.
The
steward
did
not
take
up
much
time.
He
simply
gave
Alexey
Alexei
the
money
he
needed
together
with
a
brief
statement
of
the
position
of
his
affairs,
which
was
not
altogether
satisfactory,
as
it
had
happened
that
during
that
year,
owing
to
increased
expenses,
more
had
been
paid
out
than
usual,
and
there
was
a
deficit.
But
the
doctor,
a
celebrated
Petersburg
doctor,
who
was
an
intimate
acquaintance
of
Alexey
Alexei
took
up
a
great
deal
of
time.
Alexey
Alexei
had
not
expected
him
that
day,
and
was
surprised
at
his
visit,
and
still
more
so
when
the
doctor
questioned
him
very
carefully
about
his
health,
listened
to
his
breathing,
and
tapped
at
his
liver.
Alexey
Alexei
did
not
know
that
his
friend
Lidia
Ivanovo.
noticing
that
he
was
not
as
well
as
usual
that
year,
had
begged
the
doctor
to
go
and
examine
him.
"Do
this
for
my
sake,"
the
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovo.
had
said
to
him.
"I
will
do
it
for
the
sake
of
Russia,
countess.
replied
the
doctor.
"A
priceless
man!"
said
the
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovo.
The
doctor
was
extremely
dissatisfied
with
Alexey
Alexei
He
found
the
liver
considerably
enlarged,
and
the
digestive
powers
weakened,
while
the
course
of
mineral
waters
had
been
quite
without
effect.
He
prescribed
more
physical
exercise
as
far
as
possible,
and
as
far
as
possible
less
mental
strain,
and
above
all
no
worry-free
other
words,
just
what
was
as
much
out
of
Alexey
Alexei
power
as
abstaining
from
breathing.
Then
he
withdrew,
leaving
in
Alexey
Alexei
an
unpleasant
sense
that
something
was
wrong
with
him,
and
that
there
was
no
chance
of
curing
it.
As
he
was
coming
away,
the
doctor
chanced
to
meet
on
the
staircase
an
acquaintance
of
his,
Slug
who
was
secretary
of
Alexey
Alexei
department.
They
had
been
comrades
at
the
university,
and
though
they
rarely
met,
they
thought
highly
of
each
other
and
were
excellent
friends,
and
so
there
was
no
one
to
whom
the
doctor
would
have
given
his
opinion
of
a
patient
so
freely
as
to
Slug
"How
glad
I
am
you've
been
seeing
him!"
said
Slug
"He's
not
well,
and
I
fancy;
Well,
what
do
you
think
of
him?"
"I'll
tell
you,"
said
the
doctor,
beckoning
over
Slug
head
to
his
coachman,
to
bring
the
carriage
round.
"It's
just
this,"
said
the
doctor,
taking
a
finger
of
his
kid
glove
in
his
white
hands
and
pulling
it,
"if
you
don't
strain
the
strings,
and
then
try
to
break
them,
you'll
find
it
a
difficult
job;
but
strain
a
string
to
its
very
utmost."
and
the
mere
weight
of
one
finger
on
the
strained
string
will
snap
it.
And
with
his
close
assiduous
his
conscientious
devotion
to
his
work,
he's
strained
to
the
uvulopalatopharyngoplasty,
and
there's
some
outside
burden
weighing
on
him,
and
not
a
light
one,"
concluded
the
doctor,
raising
his
eyebrows
significantly.
"Will
you
be
at
the
racetrack
he
added,
as
he
sank
into
his
seat
in
the
carriage.
"Yes,
yes,
to
be
sure;
it
does
waste
a
lot
of
time,"
the
doctor
responded
vaguely
to
some
reply
of
Slug
he
had
not
caught.
Directly
after
the
doctor,
who
had
taken
up
so
much
time,
came
the
celebrated
traveler,
and
Alexey
Alexei
by
means
of
the
pamphlet
he
had
only
just
finished
reading
and
his
previous
acquaintance
with
the
subject,
impressed
the
traveler
by
the
depth
of
his
knowledge
of
the
subject
and
the
breadth
and
enlightenment
of
his
view
of
it.
At
the
same
time
as
the
traveler
there
was
announced
a
provincial
marshal
of
nobility
on
a
visit
to
Petersburg,
with
whom
Alexey
Alexei
had
to
have
some
conversation.
After
his
departure,
he
had
to
finish
the
daily
routine
of
business
with
his
secretary,
and
then
he
still
had
to
drive
round
to
call
on
a
certain
great
personal
on
a
matter
of
grave
and
serious
import.
Alexey
Alexei
only
just
managed
to
be
back
by
five
o'clock,
his
dinner-house
and
after
dining
with
his
secretary,
he
invited
him
to
drive
with
him
to
his
country
villa
and
to
the
races.
Though
he
did
not
acknowledge
it
to
himself,
Alexey
Alexei
always
tried
nowadays
to
secure
the
presence
of
a
third
person
in
his
interviews
with
his
wife.
Chapter
27
Anna
was
upstairs,
standing
before
the
looking
glass,
and,
with
Anny
assistance,
pinning
the
last
ribbon
on
her
gown
when
she
heard
carriage
wheels
crunching
the
gravel
at
the
entrance.
"It's
too
early
for
null
she
thought,
and
glancing
out
of
the
window
she
caught
sight
of
the
carriage
and
the
black
hat
of
Alexey
Alexei
and
the
ears
that
she
knew
so
well
sticking
up
each
side
of
it.
"How
unlucky.
Can
he
be
going
to
stay
the
night?"
she
wondered,
and
the
thought
of
all
that
might
come
of
such
a
chance
struck
her
as
so
awful
and
terrible
that,
without
dwelling
on
it
for
a
moment,
she
went
down
to
meet
him
with
a
bright
and
radiant
face;
and
conscious
of
the
presence
of
that
spirit
of
falsehood
and
deceit
in
herself
that
she
had
come
to
know
of
late,
she
abandoned
herself
to
that
spirit
and
began
talking,
hardly
knowing
what
she
was
saying.
"Ah,
how
nice
of
you!"
she
said,
giving
her
husband
her
hand,
and
greeting
Slug
who
was
like
one
of
the
family,
with
a
smile.
"You're
staying
the
night,
I
hope?"
was
the
first
word
the
spirit
of
falsehood
prompted
her
to
utterance
"and
now
we'll
go
together.
Only
it's
a
pity
I've
promised
null
She's
coming
for
me."
Alexey
Alexei
knit
his
brows
at
Betsy's
name.
"Oh,
I'm
not
going
to
separate
the
insert
he
said
in
his
usual
bantering
tone.
"I'm
going
with
Mihail
Vassiliou
I'm
ordered
exercise
by
the
doctors
too.
I'll
walk,
and
fancy
myself
at
the
springs
again."
"There's
no
hurry,"
said
Anna.
"Would
you
like
teabag,"
She
rang.
"Bring
in
tea,
and
tell
Sesa
that
Alexey
Alexei
is
here.
Well,
tell
me,
how
have
you
been?
Mihail
Vassiliou
you've
not
been
to
see
me
before.
Look
how
lovely
it
is
out
on
the
terrace,"
she
said,
turning
first
to
one
and
then
to
the
other.
She
spoke
very
simply
and
naturally,
but
too
much
and
too
fast.
She
was
the
more
aware
of
this
from
noticing
in
the
inquisitive
look
Mihail
Vassiliou
turned
on
her
that
he
was,
as
it
were,
keeping
watch
on
her.
Mihail
Vassiliou
promptly
went
out
on
the
terrace.
She
sat
down
beside
her
husband.
"You
don't
look
quite
well,"
she
said.
"Yes,"
he
said;
"the
doctor's
been
with
me
today
and
wasted
an
hour
of
my
time.
I
feel
that
some
one
of
our
friends
must
have
sent
him:
my
health's
so
precious,
it
seems."
"Nobel
what
did
he
say?"
She
questioned
him
about
his
health
and
what
he
had
been
doing,
and
tried
to
persuade
him
to
take
a
rest
and
come
out
to
her.
All
this
she
said
brightly-colored
rapidly,
and
with
a
peculiar
brilliance
in
her
eyes.
But
Alexey
Alexei
did
not
now
attach
any
special
significance
to
this
tone
of
hers.
He
heard
only
her
words
and
gave
them
only
the
direct
sense
they
bore.
And
he
answered
simply,
though
jests
There
was
nothing
remarkable
in
all
this
conversation,
but
never
after
could
Anna
recall
this
brief
scene
without
an
agonizing
panga
of
shame.
Sesa
came
in
preceded
by
his
governess.
If
Alexey
Alexei
had
allowed
himself
to
observe
he
would
have
noticed
the
timid
and
bewildered
eyes
with
which
Sesa
glanced
first
at
his
father
and
then
at
his
mother.
But
he
would
not
see
anything,
and
he
did
not
see
it.
"Ah,
the
young
man!
He's
grown.
Really,
he's
getting
quite
a
man.
How
are
you,
young
man?"
And
he
gave
his
hand
to
the
scared
child.
Sesa
had
been
shy
of
his
father
before,
and
now,
ever
since
Alexey
Alexei
had
taken
to
calling
him
young
man,
and
since
that
insoluble
question
had
occurred
to
him
whether
Vrye
were
a
friend
or
a
foe,
he
avoided
his
father.
He
looked
round
towards
his
mother
as
though
seeking
shelter.
It
was
only
with
his
mother
that
he
was
at
ease.
Meanwhile,
Alexey
Alexei
was
holding
his
son
by
the
shoulder
while
he
was
speaking
to
the
governess,
and
Sesa
was
so
miserably
uncomfortable
that
Anna
saw
he
was
on
the
point
of
tears.
Anna,
who
had
flushed
a
little
the
instant
her
son
came
in,
noticing
that
Sesa
was
uncomfortable,
got
up
hurries
took
Alexey
Alexei
hand
from
her
son's
shoulder,
and
kissing
the
boy,
led
him
out
onto
the
terrace,
and
quickly
came
back.
"It's
time
to
start,
though,"
said
she,
glancing
at
her
watch.
"How
is
it
Betsy
doesn't
comeback
"Yes,"
said
Alexey
Alexei
and
getting
up,
he
folded
his
hands
and
cracked
his
fingers.
"I've
come
to
bring
you
some
money,
too,
for
nightingales."
we
know,
can't
live
on
fairy
tales,"
he
said.
"You
want
it,
I
expect?'
"No,
I
don't
...
yes,
I
do,"
she
said,
not
looking
at
him,
and
cringe
to
the
roots
of
her
hair.
"But
you'll
come
back
here
after
the
races,
I
supposed
"Oh,
yes!"
answered
Alexey
Alexei
"And
here's
the
glory
of
Peterlee,
Princess
Tvorba
he
added,
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
elegant
English
carriage
with
the
tiny
seats
placed
extremely
high.
"What
elegance'.
Charmont,
Well,
let
us
be
starting
too,
then."
Princess
Tverskaya
did
not
get
out
of
her
carriage,
but
her
groom,
in
high
boots,
a
cape,
and
black
hat,
darted
out
at
the
entrance.
"I'm
going;
good-bye,
said
Anna,
and
kissing
her
son,
she
went
up
to
Alexey
Alexei
and
held
out
her
hand
to
him.
"It
was
ever
so
nice
of
you
to
come."
Alexey
Alexei
kissed
her
hand.
"Well,
_briefly
revoke
then!"
You'll
come
back
for
some
tea;
that's
delightful,
she
said,
and
went
out,
gay
and
radiantly
But
as
soon
as
she
no
longer
saw
him,
she
was
aware
of
the
spot
on
her
hand
that
his
lips
had
touched,
and
she
shuddered
with

Chapter
28
When
Alexey
Alexei
reached
the
race-discrimination
Anna
was
already
sitting
in
the
pavilion
beside
Betsy,
in
that
pavilion
where
all
the
highest
society
had
gathered.
She
caught
sight
of
her
husband
in
the
distance.
Two
men,
her
husband
and
her
lover,
were
the
two
centers
of
her
existence,
and
unaided
by
her
external
senses
she
was
aware
of
their
nearrecord
She
was
aware
of
her
husband
approaching
a
long
way
off,
and
she
could
not
help
following
him
in
the
surging
crowd
in
the
midst
of
which
he
was
moving.
She
watched
his
progress
towards
the
pavilion,
saw
him
now
responding
condescendingly
to
an
ingratiating
bow,
now
exchanging
friendly,
nonchalant
greetings
with
his
equals,
now
assiduously
trying
to
catch
the
eye
of
some
great
one
of
this
world,
and
taking
off
his
big
round
hat
that
squeezed
the
tips
of
his
ears.
All
these
ways
of
his
she
knew,
and
all
were
hateful
to
her.
"Nothing
but
ambition,
nothing
but
the
desire
to
get
on,
that's
all
there
is
in
his
soul,"
she
thought;
"as
for
these
lofty
ideals,
love
of
culture,
religion,
they
are
only
so
many
tools
for
getting
on."
From
his
glances
towards
the
ladies'
pavilion
(he
was
staring
straight
at
her,
but
did
not
distinguish
his
wife
in
the
sea
of
muslin-lined
ribbons,
feathers,
parasols,
and
flowers)
she
saw
that
he
was
looking
for
her,
but
she
purposely
avoided
noticing
him.
"Alias
Alexei
Princess
Betsy
called
to
him;
"I'm
sure
you
don't
see
your
wife:
here
she
is."
He
smiled
his
chilly
smile.
"There's
so
much
splendor
here
that
one's
eyes
are
dazzler).
he
said,
and
he
went
into
the
pavilion.
He
smiled
to
his
wife
as
a
man
should
smile
on
meeting
his
wife
after
only
just
parting
from
her,
and
greeted
the
princess
and
other
acquaintances,
giving
to
each
what
was
due-diligence
is
to
say,
jesting
with
the
ladies
and
dealing
out
friendly
greetings
among
the
men.
Below,
near
the
pavilion,
was
standing
an
adjuvant
of
whom
Alexey
Alexei
had
a
high
opinion,
noted
for
his
intelligence
and
culture.
Alexey
Alexei
entered
into
conversation
with
him.
There
was
an
interval
between
the
races,
and
so
nothing
hindered
conversation.
The
adjuvant
expressed
his
disapproval
of
races.
Alexey
Alexei
replied
defending
them.
Anna
heard
his
high,
measured
tones,
not
losing
one
word,
and
every
word
struck
her
as
false,
and
stabbed
her
ears
with
pain.
When
the
three-mile
steeplechase
was
beginning,
she
bent
forward
and
gazed
with
fixed
eyes
at
Vrye
as
he
went
up
to
his
horse
and
mounted,
and
at
the
same
time
she
heard
that
loaves
never-completed
voice
of
her
husband.
She
was
in
an
agony
of
terror
for
Vrye
but
a
still
greater
agony
was
the
never-completed
as
it
seemed
to
her,
stream
of
her
husband's
shrill
voice
with
its
familiar
intone
"I'm
a
wicked
woman,
a
lost
woman,"
she
thought;
"but
I
don't
like
lying,
I
can't
endure
falsehood,"
while
as
for
_in
(her
husband)
it's
the
breath
of
his
life-altering
He
knows
all
about
it,
he
sees
it
all;
what
does
he
care

he
can
talk

calmness
If
he
were
to
kill
me,
if
he
were
to
kill
Vrye
I
might
respect
him.
No,
all
he
wants
is
falsehood
and
propriety.
Anna
said
to
herself,
not
considering
exactly
what
it
was
she
wanted
of
her
husband,
and
how
she
would
have
liked
to
see
him
behave.
She
did
not
understand
either
that
Alexey
Alexei
peculiar
los
that
day,
so
exasperating
to
her,
was
merely
the
expression
of
his
inward
distress
and
uneasiness.
As
a
child
that
has
been
hurt
skips
about,
putting
all
his
muscles
into
movement
to
drown
the
pain,
in
the
same
way
Alexey
Alexei
needed
mental
exercise
to
drown
the
thoughts
of
his
wife
that
in
her
presence
and
in
Vrye
and
with
the
continual
iterations
of
his
name,
would
force
themselves
on
his
attention.
And
it
was
as
natural
for
him
to
talk
well
and
cleverness
as
it
is
natural
for
a
child
to
skip
about.
He
was
saying:
"Danger.
in
the
races
of
officers,
of
cavalry
men,
is
an
essential
element
in
the
race.
If
England
can
point
to
the
most
brilliant
feats
of
cavalry
in
military
history,
it
is
simply
owing
to
the
fact
that
she
has
historically
developed
this
force
both
in
beasts
and
in
men.
Sport
has,
in
my
opinion,
a
great
value,
and
as
is
always
the
case,
we
see
nothing
but
what
is
most
superficial."
"It's
not
superficial,"
said
Princess
Tvorba
"One
of
the
officers,
they
say,
has
broken
two
ribs."
Alexey
Alexei
smiled
his
smile,
which
uncovered
his
teeth,
but
revealed
nothing
more.
"We'll
admit,
princess,
that
that's
not
superficial,"
he
said,
"but
internal.
But
that's
not
the
point,"
and
he
turned
again
to
the
general
with
whom
he
was
talking
seriously;
"we
mustn't
forget
that
those
who
are
taking
part
in
the
race
are
military
men,
who
have
chosen
that
career,
and
one
must
allow
that
every
calling
has
its
disagreeable
side.
It
forms
an
integral
part
of
the
duties
of
an
officer.
Low
sports,
such
as
prize-filled
or
Spanish
bull-headed
are
a
sign
of
barbarity.
But
specialized
trials
of
skill
are
a
sign
of
development."
"No,
I
shan't
come
another
time;
it's
too
upsetting,'
said
Princess
null
"Isn't
it,
Annaba
"It
is
upsetting,'
but
one
can't
tear
oneself
away,"
said
another
lady.
"If
I'd
been
a
Roman
woman
I
should
never
have
missed
a
single
circus."
Anna
said
nothing,
and
keeping
her
opera
glass
up,
gazed
always
at
the
same
spot.
At
that
moment
a
tall
general
walked
through
the
pavilion.
Breaking
off
what
he
was
saying,
Alexey
Alexei
got
up
hurries
though
with
dignity,
and
bowed
low
to
the
general.
"You're
not
racism
the
officer
asked,
chaffing
him.
"My
race
is
a
harder
one,"
Alexey
Alexei
responded
null
And
though
the
answer
meant
nothing,
the
general
looked
as
though
he
had
heard
a
witty
remark
from
a
witty
man,
and
fully
relished

"There
are
two
aspects,"
Alexey
Alexei
resumes
"those
who
take
part
and
those
who
look
on;
and
love
for
such
spectacles
is
an
unmistakable
proof
of

"Doveryai,
"But

Alexey
Alexei
paused
while
there
was
talking
about
him,
but
he
began
again
directly.
"I
admit
that

sports
do
not193
he
was
continuing.
But
at
that
moment
the
racers
started,
and
all
conversation
ceased.
Alexey
Alexei
too
was
silent,
and
everyone
stood
up
and
turned
towards
the
stream.
Alexey
Alexei
took
no
interest
in
the
race,
and
so
he
did
not
watch
the
racers,
but
fell
listlessly
to
scanning
the
spectators
with
his
weary
eyes.
His
eyes
rested
upon
Anna.
Her
face
was
white
and
set.
She
was
obviously
seeing
nothing
and
no
one
but
one
man.
Her
hand
had
convulsively
clutched
her
fan,
and
she
held
her
breath.
He
looked
at
her
and
hastily
turned
away,
scrutinizing
other
faces.
"But
here's
this
lady
too,
and
others
very
much
moved
as
well;
it's
very
natural,"
Alexey
Alexei
told
himself.
He
tried
not
to
look
at
her,
but
unconsciously
his
eyes
were
drawn
to
her.
He
examined
that
face
again,
trying
not
to
read
what
was
so
plainly
written
on
it,
and
against
his
own
will,
with
horror
read
on
it
what
he
did
not
want
to
know.
The
first
fall-back
at
the
stream-of-consciousness
everyone,
but
Alexey
Alexei
saw
distinctly
on
Anna's
pale,
triumphant
face
that
the
man
she
was
watching
had
not
fallen.
When,
after
Mahr
and
Vrye
had
cleared
the
worst
barrier,
the
next
officer
had
been
thrown
straight
on
his
head
at
it
and
fatally
injured,
and
a
shudder
of
horror
passed
over
the
whole
public,
Alexey
Alexei
saw
that
Anna
did
not

had
some
difficulty
in
realizing
what
they
were
talking
of
about
her.
But
more
and
more
often,
and
with
greater
persistence,
he
watched
her.
Anna,
wholly
engrossed
as
she
was
with
the
race,
became
aware
of
her
husband's
cold
eyes
fixed
upon
her
from
one
side.
She
glanced
round
for
an
instant,
looked
inquiry
at
him,
and
with
a
slight
frown
turned
away
again.
"Ah,
I
don't
care"
she
seemed
to
say
to
him,
and
she
did
not
once
glance
at
him
again.
The
race
was
an
unlucky
one,
and
of

seventeen
officers

Towards

was
intensified
by

Everyone
was
loudly
expressing
disapproval
everyone
was
repeating
a
phrase
some
one
had
uttered.

and
gladiators
will
be
the
next
thing,"
and
everyone
was
feeling
horrify
so
that
when
Vrye
fell
to
the
ground,
and
Anna
moaned
aloud,
there
was
nothing
very
out
of
the
way
in
it.
But
afterwards
a
change
came
over
Anna's
face
which
really
was
beyond
decorum.
She
utterly
lost
her
head.
She
began
fluttering
like
a
caged
bird,
at
one
moment
would
have
got
up
and
moved
away,
at
the
next
turned
to
null
"Let
us
go,
let
us
go!"
she
said.
But
Betsy
did
not
hear
her.
She
was
bending
down,
talking
to
a
general
who
had
come
up
to
her.
Alexey
Alexei
went
up
to
Anna
and
courteously
offered
her
his
arm.
"Let
us
go,
if
you
like,"
he
said
in
French,
but
Anna
was
listening
to
the
general
and
did
not
notice
her
husband.
"He's
broken
his
leg
too,
so
they
say,"
the
general
was
saying.
"This
is
beyond
everything."
Without
answering
her
husband,
Anna
lifted
her
opera
glass
and
gazed
towards
the
place
where
Vrye
had
fallen;
but
it
was
so
far
off,
and
there
was
such
a
crowd
of
people
about
it,
that
she
could
make
out
nothing.
She
laid
down
the
opera
glass,
and
would
have
moved
away,
but
at
that
moment
an
officer
galloped
up
and
made
some
announcement
to
the
Tsarandoy
Anna
craned
forward,
listening.
"Stock
Stivaletti
she
cried
to
her
brother.
But
her
brother
did
not
hear
her.
Again
she
would
have
moved
away.
"Once
more
I
offer
you
my
arm
if
you
want
to
be
going,"
said
Alexey
Alexei
reaching
towards
her
hand.
She
drew
back
from
him
with
avert
and
without
looking
in
his
face
answered:
"No,
no,
let
me
be,
I'll
stay."
She
saw
now
that
from
the
place
of
Vrye
accident
an
officer
was
running
across
the
course
towards
the
pavilion.
Betsy
waved
her
handkerchief
to
him.
The
officer
brought
the
news
that
the
rider
was
not
killed,
but
the
horse
had
broken
its
back.
On
hearing
this
Anna
sat
down
hurries
and
hid
her
face
in
her
fan.
Alexey
Alexei
saw
that
she
was
weeping,
and
could
not
control
her
tears,
nor
even
the
sobs
that
were
shaking
her
bosom.
Alexey
Alexei
stood
so
as
to
screen
her,
giving
her
time
to
recover
herself.
"For
the
third
time
I
offer
you
my
arm,"
he
said
to
her
after
a
little
time,
turning
to
her.
Anna
gazed
at
him
and
did
not
know
what
to
say.
Princess
Betsy
came
to
her
rescue.
"No,
Alexey
Alexei
I
brought
Anna
and
I
promised
to
take
her
home,"
put
in
null
"Excuse
me,
princess,"
he
said,
smiling
courteously
but
looking
her
very
firmly
in
the
face,
"but
I
see
that
Anna's
not
very
well,
and
I
wish
her
to
come
home
with
me."
Anna
looked
about
her
in
a
frightened
way,
got
up
submissiveness
and
laid
her
hand
on
her
husband's
arm.
"I'll
send
to
him
and
find
out,
and
let
you
know,"
Betsy
whispered
to
her.
As
they
left
the
pavilion,
Alexey
Alexei
as
always,
talked
to
those
he
met,
and
Anna
had,
as
always,
to
talk
and
answer;
but
she
was
utterly
beside
herself,
and
moved
hanging
on
her
husband's
arm
as
though
in
a
dream.
"Is
he
killed
or
not?
Is
it
true?
Will
he
come
or
not?
Shall
I
see
him
today?"
she
was
thinking.
She
took
her
seat
in
her
husband's
carriage
in
silence,
and
in
silence
drove
out
of
the
crowd
of
carriages.
In
spite
of
all
he
had
seen,
Alexey
Alexei
still
did
not
allow
himself
to
consider
his
wife's
real
condition.
He
merely
saw
the
outward
symptoms.
He
saw
that
she
was
behaving
unbeknown
and
considered
it
his
duty
to
tell
her
so.
But
it
was
very
difficult
for
him
not
to
say
more,
to
tell
her
nothing
but
that.
He
opened
his
mouth
to
tell
her
she
had
behaved
unbeknown
but
he
could
not
help
saying
something
utterly
different.
"What
an
inclination
we
all
have,
though,
for
these
cruel
spectacles.
he
said.
"I
observed
"Eight
I
don't
understand,"
said
Anna
contend
He
was
offended,
and
at
once
began
to
say
what
he
had
meant
to
say.
"I
am
obliged
to
tell
you,"
he
began.
"So
now
we
are
to
have
it
out,"
she
thought,
and
she
felt
frightened.
"I
am
obliged
to
tell
you
that
your
behavior
has
been
unbecoming
today,"
he
said
to
her
in
French.
"In
what
way
has
my
behavior
been
unbeknown
she
said
aloud,
turning
her
head
swiftly
and
looking
him
straight
in
the
face,
not
with
the
bright
expression
that
seemed
covering
something,
but
with
a
look
of
determination,
under
which
she
concealed
with
difficulty
the
dismay
she
was
feeling.
"Mindful
he
said,
pointing
to
the
open
window
opposite
the
coadjutor
He
got
up
and
pulled
up
the
window.
"What
did
you
consider
unbeknown
she
repeated.
"The
despair
you
were
unable
to
conceal
at
the
accident
to
one
of
the
ridership
He
waited
for
her
to
answer,
but
she
was
silent,
looking
straight
before
her.
"I
have
already
begged
you
so
to
conduct
yourself
in
society
that
even
malicious
tongues
can
find
nothing
to
say
against
you.
There
was
a
time
when
I
spoke
of
your
inward
attitude,
but
I
am
not
speaking
of
that
now.
Now
I
speak
only
of
your
external
attitude.
You
have
behaved
improperly,
and
I
would
wish
it
not
to
occur
again."
She
did
not
hear
half
of
what
he
was
saying?
she
felt
panic-stricken
before
him,
and
was
thinking
whether
it
was
true
that
Vrye
was
not
killed.
Was
it
of
him
they
were
speaking
when
they
said
the
rider
was
unhurt,
but
the
horse
had
broken
its
back?
She
merely
smiled
with
a
pretense
of
irony
when
he
finished,
and
made
no
reply,
because
she
had
not
heard
what
he
said.
Alexey
Alexei
had
begun
to
speak
boldly,
but
as
he
realized
plainly
what
he
was
speaking
of,
the
dismay
she
was
feeling
infected
him
too.
He
saw
the
smile,
and
a
strange
misapprehension
came
over
him.
"She
is
smiling
at
my
suspicions.
Yes,
she
will
tell
me
directly
what
she
told
me
before;
that
there
is
no
foundation
for
my
suspicions,
that
it's
absurd."
At
that
moment,
when
the
revelation
of
everything
was
hanging
over
him,
there
was
nothing
he
expected
so
much
as
that
she
would
answer
mockingly
as
before
that
his
suspicions
were
absurd
and
utterly
groundless.
So
terrible
to
him
was
what
he
knew
that
now
he
was
ready
to
believe
anything.
But
the
expression
of
her
face,
scared
and
gloomy,
did
not
now
promise
even
deception.
"Possibly
I
was
mistaken,"
said
he.
"If
so,
I
beg
your
pardon."
"No,
you
were
not
mistaken,"
she
said
deliberately,
looking
desperately
into
his
cold
face.
"You
were
not
mistaken.
I
was,
and
I
could
not
help
being
in
despair.
I
hear
you,
but
I
am
thinking
of
him.
I
love
him,
I
am
his
mistresses
I
can't
bear
you;
I'm
afraid
of
you,
and
I
hate
you:
You
can
do
what
you
like
to
me."
And
dropping
back
into
the
corner
of
the
carriage,
she
broke
into
sobs,
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands.
Alexey
Alexei
did
not
stir,
and
kept
looking
straight
before
him.
But
his
whole
face
suddenly
bore
the
solemn
rigidity
of
the
dead,
and
his
expression
did
not
change
during
the
whole
time
of
the
drive
home.
On
reaching
the
house
he
turned
his
head
to
her,
still
with
the
same
expression.
"Very
well!"
But
I
expect
a
strict
observance
of
the
external
forms
of
propriety
till
such
time"?
voice
shook.
I
may
take
measures
to
secure
my
honor
and
communicate
them
to
you."
He
got
out
first
and
helped
her
to
get
out.
Before
the
servants
he
pressed
her
hand,
took
his
seat
in
the
carriage,
and
drove
back
to

came
from

a
note.

to

to
find
out
how
he

and
he
writes
me
he
is
quite
well
and
unhurt,
but
in
despair.'
"So
_in
will
be
here,"
she
thought.
"What
a
good
thing
I
told
him
all!"
She
glanced
at
her
watch.
She
had
still
three
hours
to
wait,
and
the
memories
of
their
last
meeting
set
her
blood
in
flame.
"My
God,
how
light
it
is!
It's
dreadful,
but
I
do
love
to
see
his
face,
and
I
do
love

the

of

a
real
German
Fuertes,
in
consequence
of
which
the
crystallizing
process
went
on
more
vigorously
than
ever.
Princess
Shtern
wished,
above
everything,
to
present
her
daughter
to
this
German
princess,
and
the
day
after
their
arrival
she
duly
performed
this
rite.
Kitty
made
a
low
and
graceful
curtsied
in
the
_were

is
to
say,
very
elegant
frock
that
had
been
ordered

from
Paris.
The
German
princess
said,
"I
hope
the
roses
will
soon
come
back
to
this
pretty
little
face,"
and
for
the
Shtern
certain
definite
lines
of
existence
were
at
once
laid
down
from
which
there
was
no
departing.
The
Shtern
made
the
acquaintance
too
of
the
family
of
an
English
Lady
Somebody,"
and
of
a
German
countess
and
her
son,
wounded
in
the
last
war,
and
of
a
learned
Swede,
and
of
M.
Canute
and
his
sister.
But
yet
inevitably
the
Shtern
were
thrown
most
into
the
society
of
a
Moscow
lady,
Maryam
Yevstigneyev,
RuBisCO,
and
her
daughter,
whom
Kitty
disliked,
because
she
had
fallen
ill,
like
herself,
over
a
love
affair,
and
a
Moscow
colonel,
whom
Kitty
had
known
from
childhood,
and
always
seen
in
uniform
and
epecially
and
who
now,
with
his
little
eyes
and
his
open
neck
and
flowered
cravated,
was
uncommonly
ridiculous
and
tedious,
because
there
was
no
getting
rid
of
him.
When
all
this
was
so
firmly
established,
Kitty
began
to
be
very
much
bored,
especially
as
the
prince
went
away
to
Carlsbad
and
she
was
left
alone
with
her
mother.
She
took
no
interest
in
the
people
she
knew,
feeling
that
nothing
fresh
would
come
of
them.
Her
chief
mental
interest
in
the
watering.
consisted
in
watching
and
making
theories
about
the
people
she
did
not
know.
It
was
characteristic
of
Kitty
that
she
always
imagined
everything
in
people
in
the
most
favorable
light
possible,
especially
so
in
those
she
did
not
know.
And
now
as
she
made
surmises.
as
to
who
people
were,
what
were
their
relations
to
one
another,
and
what
they
were
like,
Kitty
endowed
them
with
the
most
marvelous
and
noble
characters,
and
found
confirmation
of
her
idea
in
her
observations.
Of
these
people
the
one
that
attracted
her
most
was
a
Russian
girl
who
had
come
to
the
watering.
with
an
invalid
Russian
lady,
Madame
Stahl,
as
everyone
called
her.
Madame
Stahl
belonged
to
the
highest
society,
but
she
was
so
ill
that
she
could
not
walk,
and
only
on
exceptionally
fine
days
made
her
appearance
at
the
springs
in
an
invalid
carriage.
But
it
was
not
so
much
from
ill-health
as
from
pride.
Princess
Shtern
interpreted
it-can't-happen-to-me
Madame
Stahl
had
not
made
the
acquaintance
of
anyone
among
the
Russians
there.
The
Russian
girl
looked
after
Madame
Stahl,
and
besides
that,
she
was,
as
Kitty
observed,
on
friendly
terms
with
all
the
invalids
who
were
seriously
ill,
and
there
were
many
of
them
at
the
springs,
and
looked
after
them
in
the
most
natural
way.
This
Russian
girl
was
not,
as
Kitty
gathered,
related
to
Madame
Stahl,
nor
was
she
a
paid
attendant.
Madame
Stahl
called
her
Varese
and
other
people
called
her
"Mademoiselle
Varese
Apart
from
the
interest
Kitty
took
in
this
girl's
relations
with
Madame
Stahl
and
with
other
unknown
persons,
Kitty,
as
often
happened,
felt
an
inexplicable
attraction
to
Mademoiselle
Varese
and
was
aware
when
their
eyes
met
that
she
too
liked
her.
Of
Mademoiselle
Varese
one
would
not
say
that
she
had
passed
her
first
youth,
but
she
was,
as
it
were,
a
creature
without
youth?
she
might
have
been
taken
for
nineteen
or
for
thirtyfold
If
her
features
were
criticized
separately,
she
was
handsome
rather
than
plain,
in
spite
of
the
sickly
hue
of
her
face.
She
would
have
been
a
good
figure,
too,
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
extreme
thinness
and
the
size
of
her
head,
which
was
too
large
for
her
medium
height.
But
she
was
not
likely
to
be
attractive
to
men.
She
was
like
a
fine
flower,
already
past
its
bloom
and
without
fragrance,
though
the
petals
were
still
null
Moreover,
she
would
have
been
unattractive
to
men
also
from
the
lack
of
just
what
Kitty
had
too
much
of-the-cuff
the
suppressed
fire
of
vitality,
and
the
consciousness
of
her
own
attractiveness.
She
always
seemed
absorbed
in
work
about
which
there
could
be
no
doubt,
and
so
it
seemed
she
could
not
take
interest
in
anything
outside
it.
It
was
just
this
contrast
with
her
own
position
that
was
for
Kitty
the
great
attraction
of
Mademoiselle
Varese
Kitty
felt
that
in
her,
in
her
manner
of
life,
she
would
find
an
example
of
what
she
was
now
so
painfully
seeks
interest
in
life,
a
dignity
in
life-altering
from
the
worldly
relations
of
girls
with
men,
which
so
revolted
Kitty,
and
appeared
to
her
now
as
a
shameful
hawking
about
of
goods
in
search
of
a
purchaser.
The
more
attentively
Kitty
watched
her
unknown
friend,
the
more
convinced
she
was
this
girl
was
the
perfect
creature
she
fancied
her,
and
the
more
eagerly
she
wished
to
make
her
acquaintance.
The

girls

to
meet

times
a
day,
and

time
they

"Who
are
you?
What
are
you?
Are
you
really
the
exquisite
creature
I
imagine
you
to
be?
But
for
goodness,
sake
don't
suppose,"
her
eyes
added,
"that
I
would
force
my
acquaintance
on
you,
I
simply
admire
you
and
like
you."
"I
like
you
too,
and
you're
very,
very
sweet.
And
I
should
like
you
better
still,
if
I
had
time,"
answered
the
eyes
of
the
unknown
girl.
Kitty
saw
indeed,
that
she
was
always
busy.
Either
she
was
taking
the
children
of
a
Russian
family
home
from
the
springs,
or
fetching
a
shawl
for
a
sick
lady,
and
wrapping
her
up
in
it,
or
trying
to
interest
an
irritable
invalid,
or
selecting
and
buying
cakes
for
tea
for
someone.
Soon
after
the
arrival
of
the
Shtern
there
appeared
in
the
morning
crowd
at
the
springs
two
persons
who
attracted
universal
and
unfavorable
attention.
These
were
a
tall
man
with
a
stooping
figure,
and
huge
hands,
in
an
old
coat
too
short
for
him,
with
black,
simple,
and
yet
terrible
eyes,
and
a
pockmarks
kind-spirited
woman,
very
badly
and
tastelessly
dressed.
Recognizing
these
persons
as
Russians,
Kitty
had
already
in
her
imagination
begun
constructing
a
delightful
and
touching
romance
about
them.
But
the
princess,
having
ascertained
from
the
visitors'
list
that
this
was
Nikolay
Levin
and
Maryam
Nikolai
explained
to
Kitty
what
a
bad
man
this
Levin
was,
and
all
her
fancies
about
these
two
people
vanished.
Not
so
much
from
what
her
mother
told
her,
as
from
the
fact
that
it
was
Konstantin's
brother,
this
pair
suddenly
seemed
to
Kitty
intensely
unpleasant.
This
Levin,
with
his
continual
twitching
of
his
head,
aroused
in
her
now
an
irrepressible
feeling
of
disgust.
It
seemed
to
her
that
his
big,
terrible
eyes,
which
persistently
pursued
her,
expressed
a
feeling
of
hatred
and
contempt,
and
she
tried
to
avoid
meeting
him.
Chapter
31
It
was
a
wet
day;
it
had
been
raining
all
the
morning,
and
the
invalids,"
with
their
parasols,
had
flocked
into
the
arcades.
Kitty
was
walking
there
with
her
mother
and
the
Moscow
colonel,
smart
and
jaunty
in
his
European
coat,
bought
ready-made
at
Frankfort.
They
were
walking
on
one
side
of
the
arcade,
trying
to
avoid
Levin,
who
was
walking
on
the
other
side.
Varese
in
her
dark
dress,
in
a
black
hat
with
a
turn-down
null
was
walking
up
and
down
the
whole
length
of
the
arcade
with
a
blind
Frenchwoman,
and,
every
time
she
met
Kitty,
they
exchanged
friendly
glances.
"Mammals"
couldn't
I
speak
to
her?"
said
Kitty,
watching
her
unknown
friend,
and
noticing
that
she
was
going
up
to
the
spring,
and
that
they
might
come
there
together.
"Oh,
if
you
want
to
so
much,
I'll
find
out
about
her
first
and
make
her
acquaintance
myself,"
answered
her
mother.
"What
do
you
see
in
her
out
of
the
way?
A
companion,
she
must
be.
If
you
like,
I'll
make
acquaintance
with
Madame
Stahlflaschen
I
used
to
know
her

the
princess,
lifting
her
head
haughtiness,
Kitty
knew
that
the
princess
was
offended
that
Madame
Stahl
had
seemed
to
avoid
making
her
acquaintance.
Kitty
did
not
insist.
"How
wonderfully
sweet
she
isue.
she
said,
gazing
at
Varese
just
as
she
handed
a
glass
to
the
Frendo,
"Look
how
natural
and
sweet
it
all
is."
"It's
so
funny
to
see
your
_especially
said
the
princess.
"No,
we'd
better
go
back,"
she
added,
noticing
Levin
coming
towards
them
with
his
companion
and
a
German
doctor,
to
whom
he
was
talking
very
noisily
and
angrily.
They
turned
to
go
back,
when
suddenly
they
heard,
not
noisy
talk,
but
shouting.
Levin,
stopping
short,
was
shouting
at
the
doctor,
and
the
doctor,
too,
was
excited.
A
crowd
gathered
about
them.
The
princess
and
Kitty
beat
a
hasty
retreat,
while
the
colonel
joined
the
crowd
to
find
out
what
was
the
matter.
A
few
minutes
later
the
colonel
overtook
them.
"What
was
it?"
inquired
the
princess.
"Scandalous"
and
disgraceful,
answered
the
colonel.
"The
one
thing
to
be
dreaded
is
meeting
Russians
abroad.
That
tall
gentleman
was
abusing
the
doctor,
flinging
all
sorts
of
insults
at
him
because
he
wasn't
treating
him
quite
as
he
liked,
and
he
began
waving
his
stick
at
him.
It's
simply
a
scandal"
"Oh,
how
unpleasant"
said
the
princess.
"Well,
and
how
did
it
end?"
"Luckily
at
that
point
that
...
the
one
in
the
mushroom
hat
...
intervened.
A
Russian
lady,
I
think
she
is,"
said
the
colonel.
"Mademoiselle
Varese
asked
Kitty.
"Yes,
yes.
She
came
to
the
rescue
before
anyone;
she
took
the
man
by
the
arm
and
led
him
away."
"There,
mammal
said
Kittyhawk
"you
wonder
that
I'm
enthusiastic
about
her."
The
next
day,
as
she
watched
her
unknown
friend,
Kitty
noticed
that
Mademoiselle
Varese
was
already
on
the
same
terms
with
Levin
and
his
companion
as
with
her
other

She
went
up
to
them,
entered
into
conversation
with
them,
and
served
as
interpreter
for
the
woman,
who
could
not
speak
any
foreign
language.
Kitty
began
to
entreat
her
mother
still
more
urgently
to
let
her
make
friends
with
Varese
And,
disagreeable
as
it
was
to
the
princess
to
seem
to
take
the
first
step
in
wishing
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
Madame
Stahl,
who
thought
fit
to
give
herself
airs.
she
made
inquiries
about
Varese
and,
having
ascertained
particulars
about
her
tending
to
prove
that
there
could
be
no
harm
though
little
good
in
the
acquaintance,
she
herself
approached
Varese
and
made
acquaintance
with
her.
Choosing
a
time
when
her
daughter
had
gone
to
the
spring,
while
Varese
had
stopped
outside
the
baker,
the
princess
went
up
to
her.
"Allow
me
to
make
your
acquaintance.
she
said,
with
her
dignified
smile.
"My
daughter
has
lost
her
heart
to
you,"
she
said.
"Possibly
you
do
not
know
me.
I
am/pm
"That
feeling
is
more
than
reciprocate
princess,"
Varese
answered
hurries
"What
a
good
deed
you
did
yesterday
to
our
poor
compatriots
said
the
princess.
Varese
flushed
a
little.
"I
don't
remember.
I
don't
think
I
did
anything,"
she
said.
"Why,
you
saved
that
Levin
from
disagreeable
consequences."
"Yes,

_briefly
"No,
she's
not
my

I
call
her

but
I
am
not
related
to
her;
I

brought
up
by
her,"
answered
Varese
flushing
a
little
again.
This
was
so
simply
said,
and
so
sweet
was
the
truthful
and
candid
expression
of
her
face,
that
the
princess
saw
why
Kitty
had
taken
such
a
fancy
to
Varese
"Well,
and
what's
this
Levin
going
to
do?"
asked
the
princess.
"He's
going
away,"
answered
Varese
At
that
instant
Kitty
came
up
from
the
spring
beaming
with
delight
that
her
mother
had
become
acquainted
with
her
unknown
friend.
"Well,
see,
Kitty,
your
intense
desire
to
make
friends
with

"Variety"
Varese
put
in
smiling,
"that's
what
everyone
calls
me."
Kitty
blushed
with
pleasure,
and
slowly,
without
speaking,
pressed
her
new
friend's
hand,
which
did
not
respond
to
her
pressure,
but
lay
motionless
in
her
hand.
The
hand
did
not
respond
to
her
pressure,
but
the
face
of
Mademoiselle
Varese
glowed
with
a
soft,
glad,
though
rather
mournful
smile,
that
showed
large
but
handsome
teeth.
"I
have
long
wished
for
this
too,"
she
said.
"But
you
are
so
busy."
"Oh,
no,
I'm
not
at
all
busy,"
answered
Varese
but
at
that
moment
she
had
to
leave
her
new
friends
because
two
little
Russian
girls,
children
of
an
invalid,
ran
up
to
her.
"Variety"
mammal
calling,
they
cried.
And
Varese
went
after
them.
Chapter
32
The
particulars
which
the
princess
had
learned
in
regard
to
Varese
past
and
her
relations
with
Madame
Stahl
were
as
follows:
Madame
Stahl,
of
whom
some
people
said
that
she
had
worried
her
husband
out
of
his
life,
while
others
said
it
was
he
who
had
made
her
wretched
by
his
immoral
behavior,
had
always
been
a
woman
of
weak
health
and
enthusiastic
temperament.
When,
after
her
separation
from
her
husband,
she
gave
birth
to
her
only
child,
the
child
had
died
almost
immediately,
and
the
family
of
Madame
Stahl,
knowing
her
sensibility,
and
fearing
the
news
would
kill
her,
had
substituted
another
child,
a
baby
born
the
same
night
and
in
the
same
house
in
Petersburg,
the
daughter
of
the
chief
cook
of
the
Imperial
Householders
This
was
Varese
Madame
Stahl
learned
later
on
that
Varese
was
not
her
own
child,
but
she
went
on
bringing
her
up,
especially
as
very
soon
afterwards
Varese
had
not
a
relation
of
her
own
living.
Madame
Stahl
had
now
been
living
more
than
ten
years
continuously
abroad,
in
the
south,
never
leaving
her
couch.
And
some
people
said
that
Madame
Stahl
had
made
her
social
position
as
a
philanthropic,
highly
religious
woman?
other
people
said
she
really
was
at
heart
the
highly
ethical
being,
living
for
nothing
but
the
good
of
her
fellow
creatures,
which
she
represented
herself
to
be.
No
one
knew
what
her
faith
was.
Protestant,
or
Orthodox.
But
one
fact
was
induce
was
in
amicable
relations
with
the
highest
dignitaries
of
all
the
churches
and
sects.
Varese
lived
with
her
all
the
while
abroad,
and
everyone
who
knew
Madame
Stahl
knew
and
liked
Mademoiselle
Varese
as
everyone
called
her.
Having
learned
all
these
facts,
the
princess
found
nothing
to
object
to
in
her
daughter's
intimacy
with
Varese
more
especially
as
Varese
breeding
and
education
were
of
the
best-actor
spoke
French
and
English
extremely
well-above
what
was
of
the
most
weight,
brought
a
message
from
Madame
Stahl
expressing
her
regret
that
she
was
prevented
by
her
ill
health
from
making
the
acquaintance
of
the
princess.
After
getting
to
know
Varese
Kitty
became
more
and
more
fascinated
by
her
friend,
and
every
day
she
discovered
new
virtues
in
her.
The
princess,
hearing
that
Varese
had
a
good
voice,
asked
her
to
come
and
sing
to
them
in
the
evening.
"Kitty
plays,
and
we
have
a
pianola.
not
a
good
one,
it's
true,
but
you
will
give
us
so
much
pleasure,"
said
the
princess
with
her
affected
smile,
which
Kitty
disliked
particularly
just
then,
because
she
noticed
that
Varese
had
no
inclination
to
sing.
Varese
came,
however,
in
the
evening
and
brought
a
roll
of
music
with
her.
The
princess
had
invited
Maryam
Yevstigneyev,
and
her
daughter
and
the
colonel.
Varese
seemed
quite
unaffected
by
there
being
persons
present
she
did
not
know,
and
she
went
directly
to
the
piano.
She
could
not
accompany
herself,
but
she
could
sing
music
at
sight
very
well.
Kitty,
who
played
well,
accompanied
her.
"You
have
an
extraordinary
talent,"
the
princess
said
to
her
after
Varese
had
sung
the
first
song
extremely
well.
Maryam
Yevstigneyev,
and
her
daughter
expressed
their
thanks
and
admiration.
"Look,"
said
the
colonel,
looking
out
of
the
window,
"what
an
audience
has
collected
to
listen
to
you."
There
actually
was
quite
a
considerable
crowd
under
the
windows.
"I
am
very
glad
it
gives
you
pleasure,"
Varese
answered
simply.
Kitty
looked
with
pride
at
her
friend.
She
was
enchanted
by
her
talent,
and
her
voice,
and
her
face,
but
most
of
all
by
her
manner,
by
the
way
Varese
obviously
thought
nothing
of
her
singing
and
was
quite
unmoved
by
their
praises.
She
seemed
only
to
be
asking:
"Am
I
to
sing
again,
or
is
that
enough?"
"If
it
had
been
I,"
thought
Kitty,
"how
proud
I
should
have
been"
How
delighted
I
should
have
been
to
see
that
crowd
under
the
windows,
But
she's
utterly
unmoved
by
it.
Her
only
motive
is
to
avoid
refusing
and
to
please
mammal
What
is
there
in
her?
What
is
it
gives
her
the
power
to
look
down
on
everything,
to
be
calm
independently
of
everything?
How
I
should
like
to
know
it
and
to
learn
it
of
her!"
thought
Kitty,
gazing
into
her
serene
face.
The
princess
asked
Varese
to
sing
again,
and
Varese
sang
another
song,
also
smoothly,
distinctly.
and
well,
standing
erect
at
the
piano
and
beating
time
on
it
with
her
thin,
dark-skinned
hand.
The
next
song
in
the
book
was
an
Italian
one.
Kitty
played
the
opening
bars,
and
looked
round
at
Varese
"Let's
skip
that,"
said
Varese
flushing
a
little.
Kitty
let
her
eyes
rest
on
Varese
face,
with
a
look
of
dismay
and
inquiry.
"Very
well,
the
next
one,"
she
said
hurries
turning
over
the
pages,
and
at
once
feeling
that
there
was
something
connected
with
the
song.
"No,"
answered
Varese
with
a
smile,
laying
her
hand
on
the
music,
"no,
let's
have
that
one."
And
she
sang
it
just
as
quietly,
as
coolly,
and
as
well
as
the
others.
When
she
had
finished,
they
all
thanked
her
again,
and
went
off
to
tea.
Kitty
and
Varese
went
out
into
the
little
garden
that
adjoined
the
house.
"Am
I
right,
that
you
have
some
reminiscences
connected
with
that
songbird,
said
Kitty.
"Don't
tell
me,"
she
added
hastily,
"only
say
if
I'm
right."
"No,
why
not?
I'll
tell
you
simply.
said
Varese
and,
without
waiting
for
a
reply,
she
went
on:
"Yes,
it
brings
up
memories,
once
painful
ones.
I
cared
for
someone
once,
and
I
used
to
sing
him
that
song."
Kitty
with
big,
wide-open
eyes
gazed
silently,
sympathetically
at
Varese
"I
cared
for
him,
and
he
cared
for
me;
but
his
mother
did
not
wish
it,
and
he
married
another
girl.
He's
living
now
not
far
from
us,
and
I
see
him
sometimes.
You
didn't
think
I
had
a
love
story
too,"
she
said,
and
there
was
a
faint
gleam
in
her
handsome
face
of
that
fire
which
Kitty
felt
must
once
have
glowed
all
over
her.
"I
didn't
think
so?
Why,
if
I
were
a
man,
I
could
never
care
for
anyone
else
after
knowing
you.
Only
I
can't
understand
how
he
could,
to
please
his
mother,
forget
you
and
make
you
unhappy`crowd
he
had
no
heart."
"Oh,
no,
he's
a
very
good
man,
and
I'm
not
unhappy`crowd
quite
the
contrary,
I'm
very
happy.
Well,
so
we
shan't
be
singing
any
more
now,"
she
added,
turning
towards
the
house.
"How
good
you
are!
how
good
you
are!"
cried
Kitty,
and
stopping
her,
she
kissed
her.
"If
I
could
only
be
even
a
little
like
you!"
"Why
should
you
be
like
anyone?
You're
nice
as
you
are,"
said
Varese
smiling
her
gentle,
weary
smile.
"No,
I'm
not
nice
at
all.
Come,
tell
me:
Stop
a
minute,
let's
sit
down,"
said
Kitty,
making
her
sit
down
again
beside
her.
"Tell
me,
isn't
it
humiliating
to
think
that
a
man
has
disdained
your
love,
that
he
hasn't
cared
for
it`s
"But
he
didn't
disdain
it;
I
believe
he
cared
for
me,
but
he
was
a
dutifully
son:
"Yes,
but
if
it
hadn't
been
on
account
of
his
mother,
if
it
had
been
his
own

said
Kitty,
feeling
she
was
giving
away
her
secret,
and
that
her
face,
burning
with
the
flush
of
shame,
had
betrayed
her
already.
"In
that
case
he
would
have
done
wrong,
and
I
should
not
have
regretted
him,"
answered
Varese
evidently
realizing
that
they
were
now
talking
not
of
her,
but
of
Kitty.
"But
the
humiliation,"
said
Kitty,
"the
humiliation
one
can
never
forget,
can
never
forget,"
she
said,
remembering
her
look
at
the
last
ball
during
the
pause
in
the
music.
"Where
is
the

Why,
you
did
nothing
wrong?"
"Worse,
than

shook
her
head

on

"Why,
what
is
there
null
she
said.
"You
didn't
tell
a
man,
who
didn't
care
for
you,
that
you
loved
him,
did
you?"
"Of
course
not;
I
never
said
a
word,
but
he
knew
it.
No,
no,
there
are
looks,
there
are
ways;
I
can't
forget
it,
if
I
live
a
hundred
years."
"Why
so?
I
don't
understand.
The
whole
point
is
whether
you
love
him
now
or
not,"
said
Varese
who
called
everything
by
its
name.
"I
hate
him;
I
can't
forgive
myself."
"Why,
what
for?"
"The
shame,
the
humiliation"
"Oh!
if
everyone
were
as
sensitive
as
you
are!"
said
Varese
"There
isn't
a
girl
who
hasn't
been
through
the
same.
And
it's
all
so
unimportant;
"Why,
what
is
important?"
said
Kitty,
looking
into
her
face
with
inquisitive
wonder.
"Oh,
there's
so
much
that's
important,"
said
Varese
smiling.
"Why,
what?"
"Oh,
so
much
that's
more
important,"
answered
Varese
not
knowing
what
to
say.
But
at
that
instant
they
heard
the
princess,
voice
from
the
window.
"Klansas
it's
cold"
Either
get
a
shawl,
or
come
indoors."
"It
really
is
time
to
go
in"
said
Varese
getting
up.
"I
have
to
go
on
to
Madame
Berthelot
she
asked
me
to."
Kitty
held
her
by
the
hand,
and
with
passionate
curiosity
and
entreaty
her
eyes
asked
her:
"What
is
it,
what
is
this
of
such
importance
that
gives

such

You

me!"
But
Varese
did
not
even
know
what

eyes
were
asking
her.
She
merely
thought
that
she
had
to
go
to
see
Madame
Berthelot
too
that
evening,
and
to
make
haste
home
in
time
for
_may
tea
at
twelve
o'clock.
She
went
indoors,
collected
her
music,
and
saying
good-bye
to
everyone,
was
about
to
go.
"Allow
me
to
see
you
home,"
said
the
colonel.
"Yes,
how
can
you
go
alone
at
night
like
this?"
chimed
in
the
princess.
"Anywhere

Parasher
Kitty
saw
that
Varese
could
hardly
restrain
a
smile
at
the
idea
that
she
needed
an
escort.
"No,
I
always
go
about
alone
and
nothing
ever
happens
to
me,"
she
said,
taking
her
hat.
And
kissing
Kitty
once
more,
without
saying
what
was
important,
she
stepped
out
courageously
with
the
music
under
her
arm
and
vanished
into
the
twilight
of
the
summer
night,
bearing
away
with
her
her
secret
of
what
was
important
and
what
gave
her
the
calm
and
dignity
so
much
to
be
envied.
Chapter
33
Kitty
made
the
acquaintance
of
Madame
Stahl
too,
and
this
acquaintance,
together
with
her
friendship
with
Varese
did
not
merely
exercise
a
great
influence
on
her,
it
also
comforted
her
in
her
mental
distress.
She
found
this
comfort
through
a
completely
new
world
being
opened
to
her
by
means
of
this
acquaintance,
a
world
having
nothing
in
common
with
her
past,
an
exalting
noble
world,
from
the
height
of
which
she
could
contemplate
her
past
calmly.
It
was
revealed
to
her
that
besides
the
instinctive
life
to
which
Kitty
had
given
herself
up
hitherto
there
was
a
spiritual
life.
This
life
was
disclosed
in
religion,
but
a
religion
having
nothing
in
common
with
that
one
which
Kitty
had
known
from
childhood,
and
which
found
expression
in
litanies
and
all-night
services
at
the
Widow,
Home,
where
one
might
meet
one's
friends,
and
in
learning
by
heart
Slavonic
texts
with
the
priest.
This
was
a
lofty,
mysterious
religion
connected
with
a
whole
series
of
noble
thoughts
and
feelings,
which
one
could
do
more
than
merely
believe
because
one
was
told
to,
which
one
could
love.
Kitty
found
all
this
out
not
from
words.
Madame
Stahl
talked
to
Kitty
as
to
a
charming
child
that
one
looks
on
with
pleasure
as
on
the
memory
of
one's
youth,
and
only
once
she
said
in
passing
that
in
all
human
sorrows
nothing
gives
comfort
but
love
and
faith,
and
that
in
the
sight
of
Christ's
compassion
for
us
no
sorrow
is
trifling.
immediately
talked
of
other
things.
But
in
every
gesture
of
Madame
Stahl,
in
every
word,
in
every
heavens
Kitty
called
it-can't-happen-to-me
and
above
all
in
the
whole
story
of
her
life,
which
she
heard
from
Varese
Kitty
recognized
that
something
"that
was
important,"
of
which,
till
then,
she
had
known
nothing.
Yet,
elevated
as
Madame
Stahl's
character
was,
touching
as
was
her
story,
and
exalted
and
moving
as
was
her
speech,
Kitty
could
not
help
detecting
in
her
some
traits
which
perplexed
her.
She
noticed
that
when
questioning
her
about
her
family,
Madame
Stahl
had
smiled
contend
which
was
not
in
accord
with
Christian
meet
She
noticed,
too,
that
when
she
had
found
a
Catholic
priest
with
her,
Madame
Stahl
had
studiously
kept
her
face
in
the
shadow
of
the
lampoon
and
had
smiled
in
a
peculiar
way.
Trivial
as
these
two
observations
were,
they
perplexed
her,
and
she
had
her
doubts
as
to
Madame
Stahl.
But
on
the
other
hand
Varese
alone
in
the
world,
without
friends
or
relations,
with
a
melancholy
disappointment
in
the
past,
desiring
nothing,
regretting
nothing,
was
just
that
perfection
of
which
Kitty
dared
hardly
dream.
In
Varese
she
realized
that
one
has
but
to
forget
oneself
and
love
others,
and
one
will
be
calm,
happy,
and
noble.
And
that
was
what
Kitty
longed
to
be.
Seeing
now
clearly
what
was
_the
most
importantly
Kitty
was
not
satisfied
with
being
enthusiastic
over
it;
she
at
once
gave
herself
up
with
her
whole
soul
to
the
new
life
that
was
opening
to
her.
From
Varese
accounts
of
the
doings
of
Madame
Stahl
and
other
people
whom
she
mentioned,
Kitty
had
already
constructed
the
plan
of
her
own
future
life.
She
would,
like
Madame
Stahl's
niece,
Aline,
of
whom
Varese
had
talked
to
her
a
great
deal,
seek
out
those
who
were
in
trouble,
wherever
she
might
be
living,
help
them
as
far
as
she
could,
give
them
the
Gospel,
read
the
Gospel
to
the
sick,
to
criminals,
to
the
dying.
The
idea
of
reading
the
Gospel
to
criminals,
as
Aline
did,
particularly
fascinated
Kitty.
But
all
these
were
secret
dreams,
of
which
Kitty
did
not
talk
either
to
her
mother
or
to
Varese
While
awaiting
the
time
for
carrying
out
her
plans
on
a
large
scale,
however,
Kitty,
even
then
at
the
springs,
where
there
were
so
many
people
ill
and
unhappy,
readily
found
a
chance
for
practicing
her
new
principles
in
imitation
of
Varese
At
first
the
princess
noticed
nothing
but
that
Kitty
was
much
under
the
influence
of
her
_especially
as
she
called
it,
for
Madame
Stahl,
and
still
more
for
Varese
She
saw
that
Kitty
did
not
merely
imitate
Varese
in
her
conduct,
but
unconsciously
imitated
her
in
her
manner
of
walking,
of
talking,
of
blinking
her
eyes.
But
later
on
the
princess
noticed
that,
apart
from
this
adoration.
some
kind
of
serious
spiritual
change
was
taking
place
in
her
daughter.
The
princess
saw
that
in
the
evenings
Kitty
read
a
French
testament
that
Madame
Stahl
had
given
her.
thing
she
had
never
done
before;
that
she
avoided
society
acquaintances
and
associated
with
the
sick
people
who
were
under
Varese
protection,
and
especially
one
poor
family,
that
of
a
sick
painter,
Petrova,
Kitty
was
unmistakably
proud
of
playing
the
part
of
a
sister
of
mercy
in
that
family.
All
this
was
well
enough,
and
the
princess
had
nothing
to
say
against
it,
especially
as
Petrov,
wife
was
a
perfectly
nice
sort
of
woman,
and
that
the
German
princess,
noticing
Kitty,
devotion,
praised
her,
calling
her
an
angel
of
consolation.
All
this
would
have
been
very
well,
if
there
had
been
no
exaggeration.
But
the
princess
saw
that
her
daughter
was
rushing
into
extremes,
and
so
indeed
she
told
her.
"`A
ne
fauves.
null
rien'.
outriders,
she
said
to
her.
Her
daughter
made
her
no
reply,
only
in
her
heart
she
thought
that
one
could
not
talk
about
exaggeration
where
Christianity
was
concerned.
What
exaggeration
could
there
be
in
the
practice
of
a
doctrine
wherein
one
was
bidder
to
turn
the
other
cheek
when
one
was
smock
and
give
one's
cloak
if
one's
coat
were
taken?
But
the
princess
disliked
this
exaggeration,
and
disliked
even
more
the
fact
that
she
felt
her
daughter
did
not
care
to
show
her
all
her
heart.
Kitty
did
in
fact
conceal
her
new
views
and
feelings
from
her
mother.
She
concealed
them
not
because
she
did
not
respect
or
did
not
love
her
mother,
but
simply
because
she
was
her
mother.
She
would
have
revealed
them
to
anyone
sooner
than
to
her
mother.
"How
is
it
Anna
Pavlovski
not
been
to
see
us
for
so
long?"
the
princess
said
one
day
of
Madame
Petrovic
"I've
asked
her,
but
she
seems
put
out
about
something."
"No,
I've
not
noticed
it,
mamas
said
Kitty,
flushing
hotly.
"Is
it
long
since
you
went
to
see
them?"
"We're
meaning
to
make
an
expedition
to
the
mountains
tomorrow,"
answered
Kitty.
"Well,
you
can
go,"
answered
the
princess,
gazing
at
her
daughter's
embarrassed
face
and
trying
to
guess
the
cause
of
her
embarrassment.
That
day
Varese
came
to
dinner
and
told
them
that
Anna
Pavlovski
had
changed
her
mind
and
given
up
the
expedition
for
the
morsel
And
the
princess
noticed
again
that
Kitty
reddening,
"Klansas
haven't
you
had
some
misunderstanding
with
the
Petrovsky
said
the
princess,
when
they
were
left
alone.
"Why
has
she
given
up
sending
the
children
and
coming
to
see
us?"
Kitty
answered
that
nothing
had
happened
between
them,
and
that
she
could
not
tell
why
Anna
Pavlovski
seemed
displeased
with
her.
Kitty
answered
perfectly
truly.
She
did
not
know
the
reason
Anna
Pavlovski
had
changed
to
her,
but
she
guessed
it.
She
guessed
at
something
which
she
could
not
tell
her
mother,
which
she
did
not
put
into
words
to
herself.
It
was
one
of
those
things
which
one
knows
but
which
one
can
never
speak
of
even
to
oneself,
so
terrible
and
shameful
would
it
be
to
be
mistaken.
Again
and
again
she
went
over
in
her
memory
all
her
relations
with
the
family.
She
remembered
the
simple
delight
expressed
on
the
round,
good-humored
face
of
Anna
Pavlovski
at
their
meetings;
she
remembered
their
secret
confected
about
the
invalid,
their
plots
to
draw
him
away
from
the
work
which
was
forbidden
him,
and
to
get
him
out-of-favor
the
devotion
of
the
youngest
boy,
who
used
to
call
her
"my
Kitty.
and
would
not
go
to
bed
without
her.
How
nice
it
all
was!
Then
she
recalled
the
thin,
terribly
thin
figure
of
Petrov,
with
his
long
neck,
in
his
brown
coat,
his
scant.
curly
hair,
his
questioning
blue
eyes
that
were
so
terrible
to
Kitty
at
first,
and
his
painful
attempts
to
seem
hearty
and
lively
in
her
presence.
She
recalled
the
efforts
she
had
made
at
first
to
overcome
the
repugnance
she
felt
for
him,
as
for
all
consumptive
people,
and
the
pains
it
had
cost
her
to
think
of
things
to
say
to
him.
She
recalled
the
timid,
softened
look
with
which
he
gazed
at
her,
and
the
strange
feeling
of
compassion
and
awkwardnesses
and
later
of
a
sense
of
her
own
goodness,
which
she
had
felt
at
it.
How
nice
it
all
was!
But
all
that
was
at
first.
Now,
a
few
days
ago,
everything
was
suddenly
spoiled.
Anna
Pavlovski
had
met
Kitty
with
affected
cordiality,"
and
had
kept
continual
watch
on
her
and
on
her
husband.
Could
that
touching
pleasure
he
showed
when
she
came
near
be
the
cause
of
Anna
Pavlovski
cools
"Yes,"
she
mused,
"there
was
something
unnatural
about
Anna
Pavlovski
and
utterly
unlike
her
good
nature,
when
she
said
angrily
the
day
before
yesterday:
'Therefore,
he
will
keep
waiting
for
you;
he
wouldn't
drink
his
coffee
without
you,
though
he's
grown
so
dreadfully
weak:
"Yes,
perhaps,
too,
she
didn't
like
it
when
I
gave
him
the
rug.
It
was
all
so
simple,
but
he
took
it
so
awkwardly,
and
was
so
long
thanking
me,
that
I
felt
awkward
too.
And
then
that
portrait
of
me
he
did
so
well.
And
most
of
all
that
look
of
confusion
and
tenderness.
Yes,
yes,
that's
it!"
Kitty
repeated
to
herself
with
horror.
"No,
it
can't
be,
it
oughtn't
to
be!"
He's
so
much
to
be
pitiful
she
said
to
herself
directly
after.
This
doubt
poisoned
the
charm
of
her
new
life.
Chapter
34
Before
the
end
of
the
course
of
drinking
the
waters,
Prince
Shtern
who
had
gone
on
from
Carlsbad
to
Baden
and
Kissingen,
to
Russian
friends.

a
breath
of
Russian
air,
as
he
said.
back
to
his
wife
and
daughter.
The
views
of
the
prince
and
of
the
princess
on
life
abroad
were
completely
opposed.
The
princess
thought
everything
delightful,
and
in
spite
of
her
established
position
in
Russian
society,
she
tried
abroad
to
be
like
a
European
fashionable
lady,
which
she
was
not-Orthodox.
the
simple
reason
that
she
was
a
typical
Russian
gentling
and
so
she
was
affected,
which
did
not
altogether
suit
her.
The
prince,
on
the
contrary,
thought
everything
foreign
detested
got
sick
of
European
life,
kept
to
his
Russian
habits,
and
purposely
tried
to
show
himself
abroad
less
European
than
he
was
in
reality.
The
prince
returned
thinner,
with
the
skin
hanging
in
loose
bags
on
his
cheeks,
but
in
the
most
cheerful
frame
of
mind.
His
good
humor
was
even
greater
when
he
saw
Kitty
completely
recovered.
The
news
of
Kitty,
friendship
with
Madame
Stahl
and
Varese
and
the
reports
the
princess
gave
him
of
some
kind
of
change
she
had
noticed
in
Kitty,
troubled
the
prince
and
aroused
his
habitual
feeling
of
jealousy
of
everything
that
drew
his
daughter
away
from
him,
and
a
dread
that
his
daughter
might
have
got
out
of
the
reach
of
his
influence
into
regions
inaccessible
to
him.
But
these
unpleasant
matters
were
all
drowned
in
the
sea
of
kindliness
and
good
humor
which
was
always
within
him,
and
more
so
than
ever
since
his
course
of
Carlsbad
waters.
The
day
after
his
arrival
the
prince,
in
his
long
overcoat,
with
his
Russian
wrinkles
and
baggy
cheeks
propped
up
by
a
starched
collar,
set
off
with
his
daughter
to
the
spring
in
the
greatest
good
humor.
It
was
a
lovely
morning:
the
bright,
cheerful
houses
with
their
little
gardens,
the
sight
of
the
red-faced,
red-baiting
beer-drinking
German
waitresses,
working
away
merriment
did
the
heart
good.
But
the
nearer
they
got
to
the
springs
the
oftenjuvenile
they
met
sick
people;
and
their
appearance
seemed
more
pitiable
than
ever
among
the
everyday
conditions
of
prosperous
German
life.
Kitty
was
no
longer
struck
by
this
contrast.
The
bright
sun,
the
brilliant
green
of
the
foliage,
the
strains
of
the

for
her

natural
setting
of
all
these
familiar
faces,

their
changes
to

or
to
convalescence,
for
which
she
watched.
But
to
the
prince
the
brightness
and
gaiety
of
the
June
morning,
and
the
sound
of
the
orchestra
playing
a
gay
waltz
then
in
fashion,
and
above
all,
the
appearance
of
the
healthy
attendants,
seemed
something
unseemly
and
monstrous,
in
conjunction
with
these
slowly
moving,
dying
figures
gathered
together
from
all
parts
of
Europe.
In
spite
of
his
feeling
of
pride
and,
as
it
were,
of
the
return
of
youth,
with
his
favorite
daughter
on
his
arm,
he
felt
awkward,
and
almost
ashamed
of
his
vigorous
step
and
his
sturdy,
stout
limbs.
He
felt
almost
like
a
man
not
dressed
in
a
crowd.
"Present
me
to
your
new
friends,"
he
said
to
his
daughter,
squeezing
her
hand
with
his
elbow.
"I
like
even
your
horrid
Soden
for
making
you
so
well
again.
Only
it's
melancholy,
very
melancholy
here.
Who's
that?"
Kitty
mentioned
the
names
of
all
the
people
they
met,
with
some
of
whom
she
was
acquainted
and
some
not.
At
the
entrance
of
the
garden
they
met
the
blind
lady,
Madame
Berthelot
with
her
guide,
and
the
prince
was
delighted
to
see
the
old
Frenchwoman,

She
at
once
began
talking
to
him
with
French
exaggerated
politeness,
applauding
him
for
having
such
a
delightful
daughter,
extolling
Kitty
to
the
skies
before
her
face,
and
calling
her
a
treasure,
a
pearl,
and
a
consoling
angel.
"Well,
she's
the
second
angel,
then,"
said
the
prince,
smiling.
"she
calls

"Oh!

they
met
Varese

between

and

and
immediately
began
talking
to
the
prince,
without
shyness,
naturally,
as
she
talked
to
everyone.
"Of
course
I
know
you;
I
know
you
very
well,"
the
prince
said
to
her
with
a
smile,
in
which
Kitty
detected
with
joy
that
her
father
liked
her
friend.
"Where

she
said,
turning
to
Kitty.
"She
has

advised
her
to
go
out.
I'm
taking
her

"So
that's

said
the
prince
when
Varese
had
gone
on.
Kitty
saw
that
her
father
had
meant
to
make
fun
of
Varese
but
that
he
could
not
do
it
because
he
liked
her.
"Come,
so
we
shall
see
all
your
friends,"
he
went
on,
"even

asked
apprehensively.
catching
the
gleam
of
irony
that
kindled
in
the
prince's
eyes
at
the
mention
of
Madame
Stahl.
"I
used
to
know
her
husband,
and
her
too

before
she'd

is

asked
Kitty,
dismayed
to
find
that
what
she
prized
so
highly
in
Madame
Stahl
had
a
name.
"I
don't
quite
know
myself.
I
only
know
that
she
thanks
God
for
everything,
for
every
misfortune,
and
thanks
God
too
that
her
husband
died.
And
that's
rather
droll,
as
they
didn't
get
on
together."
"Who's
that?
What
a
pitfall
face"
he
asked,
noticing
a
sick
man
of
medium
height
sitting
on
a
bench,
wearing
a
brown
overcoat
and
white
trousers
that
fell
in
strange
folds
about
his
long,
fleshless
legs.
This
man
lifted
his
straw
hat,
showed
his
scanty
curly
hair
and
high
forehead,
painfully
reddened
by
the
pressure
of
the
hat.
"That's
Petrov,
an
artist,"
answered
Kitty,
blushing.
"And
that's
his
wife,"
she
added,
indicating
Anna
Pavlovski
who,
as
though
on
purpose,
at
the
very
instant
they
approached
walked
away
after
a
child
that
had
run
off
along
a
path.
"Poor
fellow"
and
what
a
nice
face
he
has"
said
the
prince.
"Why
don't
you
go
up
to
him?
He
wanted
to
speak
to
you."
"Well,
let
us
go,
then,"
said
Kitty,
turning
round
resolutely."
"How
are
you
feeling
today?"
she
asked
Petrova,
Petrov
got
up,
leaning
on
his
stick,
and
looked
shyly
at
the
prince.
"This
is
my
daughter,"
said
the
prince.
"Let
me
introduce
myself."
The
painter
bowed
and
smiled,
showing
his
strangely
dazzling
white
teeth.
"We
expected
you
yesterday,
princess,"
he
said
to
Kitty.
He
staggered
as
he
said
this,
and
then
repeated
the
motion,
trying
to
make
it
seem
as
if
it
had
been
intentional.
"I
meant
to
come,
but
Varese
said
that
Anna
Pavlovski
sent
word
you
were
not
going."
"Not
going"
said
Petrov,
blushing.
and
immediately
beginning
to
cough,
and
his
eyes
sought
his
wife.
"Ann

he
said
loudly,
and
the
swollen
veins
stood
out
like
cords
on
his
thin
white
neck.
Anna
Pavlovski
came
up.
"So
you
sent
word
to
the
princess
that
we
weren't
going"
he
whispered
to
her
angrily,
losing
his
voice.
"Good
morning,
princess,"
said
Anna
Pavlovski
with
an
assumed
smile
utterly
unlike
her
former
manner.
"Very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance.
she
said
to
the
prince.
"You've
long
been
expected,
prince."
"What
did
you
send
word
to
the
princess
that
we
weren't
going
for?"
the
artist
whispered
hoarsely
once
more,
still
more
angrily,
obviously
exasperated
that
his
voice
failed
him
so
that
he
could
not
give
his
words
the
expression
he
would
have
liked
to.
"Oh,
mercy
on
us!
I
thought
we
weren't

his
wife
answered
crossover
"What,

coughed
and
waved
his
hand.
The
prince
took
off

and
moved
away
with
his
daughter.
"Ah!

sighed
deeply.
"Oh,

she
went
on
briskly,
trying
to
drown
the
distress
that
the
queer,
change
in
Anna
Pavlovski
manner
to
her
had
aroused
in
her.
"Oh,
here's
Madame
Stahl,'

Kitty,
indicating
an
invalid
carriage,
where,
propped
on
pillows,
something
in
gray
and
blue
was
lying
under

Several
invalids
were
lingering
near
the
low
carriage,
staring
at
the
lady
as
though
she
were
some
curiosity.
The
prince
went
up
to
her,
and
Kitty
detected
that
disconcerting
gleam
of
irony
in
his
eyes.
He
went
up
to
Madame
Stahl,
and
addressed
her
with
extreme
courtesy
and
affability
in
that
excellent
French
that
so
few
speak
nowadays.
"I
don't
know
if
you
remember
me,
but
I
must
recall
myself
to
thank
you
for
your
kindness
to
my
daughter,"
he
said,
taking
off
his
hat
and
not
putting
it
on
again.
"Prince

Madame

lifting
upon
him

look

to

had

over

not
to
her
satisfaction.
"To

said
the

with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye.
"That
is
not
for
us
to
judge,"
said
Madame
Stahl,
perceiving
the
shade
of
expression
on
the
prince's
face.
"So
you

dear
count?

she
said
to

young
Swede.

the

with
a
bow
to

walked
away
with
his

the
Moscow
colonel,

joined

"That's

the
Moscow
colonel
said
with
ironical
intention.
He
cherished
a
grudge
against
Madame
Stahl
for
not
making
his
acquaintance.
"She's
just
the

replied
the
prince.
"Did
you

her

illness,

say
before

"Yes.

the
prince.

"She
doesn't
stand

are

a

"Papa,"

not

cried
Kitty.
"That's

he
added.

not
because
she
had
nothing

but
because
she
did
not

to
reveal

to

But,
strange
to

she
had

made

not
to
be

that

lay
down

she
had
a

and
worried

Chapter
35
The
prince
communicated
his
good
humor
to
his
own
family
and
his
friends,
and
even
to
the
German
landlord
in
whose
rooms
the
Shtern
were
staying.
On
coming
back
with
Kitty
from
the
springs,
the
prince,
who
had
asked
the
colonel,
and
Maryam
Yevstigneyev,
and
Varese
all
to
come
and
have
coffee
with
them,
gave
orders
for
a
table
and
chairs
to
be
taken
into
the
garden
under
the
chestnut
tree,
and
lunch
to
be
laid
there.
The
landlord
and
the
servants,
too,
grew
brisker
under
the
influence
of
his
good
spirits.
They
knew
his
open-heart
and
half
an
hour
later
the
invalid
doctor
from
Hamburg,
who
lived
on
the
top
floor,
looked
enviously
out
of
the
window
at
the
merry
party
of
healthy
Russians
assembled
under
the
chestnut
tree.
In
the
trembling
circles
of
shadow
cast
by
the
leaves,
at
a
table,
covered
with
a
white
cloth,
and
set
with

cheese,
and
cold
game,
sat
the
princess
in
a
high
cap
with
lilac
ribbons,
distributing
cups
and
bread-and-butter.
At
the
other
end
sat
the
prince,
eating
heartily,
and
talking
loudly
and
merriment
The
prince
had
spread
out
near
him
his
purchases,
carved
boxes,
and
knicker-type

of
all
sorts,
of
which
he
bought
a
heap

every

and
bestowed
them
upon
everyone,
including
Liesener,
the
servant
girl,
and
the
landlord,
with
whom
he
jested
in
his
comically
bad
German,
assuring
him
that
it
was
not
the
water
had
cured
Kitty,
but
his
splendid
cookery,
especially
his
plum
soup.
The
princess
laughed
at
her
husband
for
his
Russian
ways,
but
she
was
more
lively
and
good-humored
than
she
had
been
all
the
while
she
had
been
at
the
waters.
The
colonel
smiled,
as
he
always
did,
at
the
prince's
jokes,
but
as
far
as
regards
Europe,
of
which
he
believed
himself
to
be
making
a
careful
study,
he
took

at

the
prince
said,
and
his
jokes
made
Varese
helpless
with
feeble
but
infectious
laughter,
which
was
something
Kitty
had
never
seen
before.
Kitty
was
glad
of
all
this,
but
she
could
not
be
light-hearted.
She
could
not
solve
the
problem
her
father
had
unconsciously
set
her
by
his
goodies
view
of
her
friends,
and
of
the
life
that
had
so
attracted
her.
To
this
doubt
there
was
joined
the
change
in
her
relations
with
the
Petrovsky
which
had
been
so
conspicuously
and
unpleasantly
marked
that
morning.
Everyone
was
good
humorist
but
Kitty
could
not
feel
good
humorist
and
this
increased
her
distress.
She
felt
a
feeling
such
as
she
had
known
in
childhood,
when
she
had
been
shut
in
her
room
as
a
punishment,
and
had
heard
her
sisters'
merry
laughter
outside.
"Well,
but
what
did
you
buy
this
mass
of
things
for?"
said
the
princess,
smiling,
and
handing
her
husband
a
cup
of
coffee.
"One
goes
for
a
walk,
one
looks
in
a
shop,
and
they
ask
you
to

"It's
simply
from
boredom,"
said
the
princess.
"Of

it
is.

"How
can
you
be

There's
so
much
that's
interesting
now
in
Germany,"
said
Maryam
Yevstigneyev,
"But
I
know
everything
that's
interesting:
the
plum
soup
I
know,
and
the
pea
sausages
I
know.
I
know
everything."
"No,
you
may
say
what
you
like,
prince,
there's
the
interest
of
their
institutions,"
said
the
colonel.
"But
what
is
there
interesting
about
it?
They're
all
as
pleased
as

They've
conquered
everybody,
and
why
am

to

at
that?
I
haven't

obliged
to
take
off
my
own
boots,
yes,
and
put
them
away
too;

the
morning,
get
up
and
dress
at
once,
and
go
to
the
dining
room
to
drink
bad
tea'.
How
different
it
is
at
home!
You
get
up
in
no
haste,
you
get

grumble
a
little,
and
come
round
again.
You've

to

"But
time's

you
forget
that,"
said
the
colonel.
"Times
indeed,
that
depends"
Why,
there's
time
one
would
give
a

of
for

and

you
wouldn't
give

to

"I
must
be
going
home,"
said
Varese
getting
up,
and
again
she
went
off
into
a
giggle.
When
she
had
recovered,
she
said
good-bye,
and
went
into
the
house
to
get
her
hat.
Kitty
followed
her.
Even
Varese
struck
her
as
different.
She
was
not
worse,
but
different
from
what
she
had
fancied
her
before.
"Oh,

impatiently,
looking
darkly
at

there
was

know
how

Kitty,
scowling
more
than
ever,
kept
silent,
and
Varese
went
on
speaking
alone,
trying
to
soften
or
soothe
her,
and
seeing
a
storm
coming-down
did
not
know
whether
of

of

Kitty
cried
quickly,
snatching
the
parasol
out
of
Varese
hand,
and
looking
past
her
friend's
face.
Varese
felt
inclined
to
smile,
looking
at
her
childish
fury,"
but
she
was
afraid
of
wounding
her.
"How
does
it
serve

I
don't

she
said.
"It

This

So

"What
is
not

asked
Varese
in
bewilderment.
"Everytime

can't

from

and
you

I
liked

"You

Varese
"But

"Klansas
they
heard
her
mother's
voice,
"come
here,
show

Kitty,
with
a
haughty
air,
without
making
peace
with
her
friend,
took
the
necklace
in
a
little
box
from
the
table
and
went
to
her
mother.
"What's
the
matter?
Why
are
you
so
redacted
her
mother
and
father
said
to
her
with
one
voice.
"Nothing,"
she
answered.
"I'll
be
back
directly,"
and
she
ran
back.
"She's
still
here,"
she
thought.
"What
am
I
to
say
to
her?
Oh,
dear,
what
have
I
done,
what
have
I
said?
Why
was
I
rude
to
her?
What
am
I
to
do?
What
am
I
to
say
to
her?"
thought
Kitty,
and
she
stopped
in
the
doorway.
Varese
in
her
hat
and
with
the
parasol
in
her
hands
was
sitting
at
the
table
examining
the
spring
which
Kitty
had
broken.
She
lifted
her
head.
"Variety"
forgive
me,
do
forgive
me,"
whispered
Kitty,
going
up
to
her.
"I
don't
remember
what
I
said.
I.A.
"I
really
didn't
mean
to
hurt
you,"
said
Varese
smiling.
Peace
was
made.
But
with
her
father's
coming
all
the
world
in
which
she
had
been
living
was
transformed
for
Kitty.
She
did
not
give
up
everything
she
had
learned,
but
she
became
aware
that
she
had
deceived
herself
in
supposing
she
could
be
what
she
wanted
to
be.
Her
eyes
were,
it
seemed,
opened;
she
felt
all
the
difficulty
of
maintaining
herself
without
hypocrisy
and
self-confessed
on
the
pinnacle
to
which
she
had
wished
to
mount.
Moreover,
she
became
aware
of
all
the
dreariness
of
the
world
of
sorrow,
of
sick
and
dying
people,
in
which
she
had
been
living.
The
efforts
she
had
made
to
like
it
seemed
to
her
intolerable,
and
she
felt
a
longing
to
get
back
quickly
into
the
fresh
air,
to
Russia,
to
Erhac
where,
as
she
knew
from
letters,
her
sister
Dolly
had
already
gone
with
her
children.
But
her
affection
for
Varese
did
not
wane.
As
she
said
good-bye,
Kitty
begged
her
to
come
to
them
in
Russia.
"I'll
come
when
you
get
married,"
said
Varese
"I
shall
never
marry;
"Well,
then,
I
shall
never
come."
"Well,
then,
I
shall
be
married
simply
for
that.
Mind
now,
remember
your
promise,"
said
Kitty.
The
doctor's
prediction
was
fulfilled.
Kitty
returned
home
to
Russia
cured.
She
was
not
so
gay
and
thoughtless
as
before,
but
she
was
serene.
Her
Moscow
troubles
had
become
a
memory
to
her.
PART
THREE
Chapter
1
Sergey
Ivanovo.
Kozo
wanted
a
rest
from
mental
work,
and
instead
of
going
abroad
as
he
usually
did,
he
came
towards
the
end
of
May
to
stay
in
the
country
with
his
brother.
In
his
judgment
the
best
sort
of
life
was
a
country
life.
He
had
come
now
to
enjoy
such
a
life
at
his
brother)
Konstantin
Levin
was
very
glad
to
have
him,
especially
as
he
did
not
expect
his
brother
Nikolay
that
summer.
But
in
spite
of
his
affection
and
respect
for
Sergey
Ivanovo.
Konstantin
Levin
was
uncomfortable
with
his
brother
in
the
country.
It
made
him
uncomfortable,
and
it
positively
annoyed
him
to
see
his
brother's
attitude
to
the
country.
To
Konstantin
Levin
the
country
was
the
background
of
life,
that
is
of
pleasures,
endeavors,
labor.
To
Sergey
Ivanovo.
the
country
meant
on
one
hand
rest
from
work,
on
the
other
a
valuable
antidote
to
the
corrupt
influences
of
town,
which
he
took
with
satisfaction
and
a
sense
of
its
utility.
To
Konstantin
Levin
the
country
was
good
first
because
it
afforded
a
field
for
labor,
of
the
usefulness
of
which
there
could
be
no
doubt.
To
Sergey
Ivanovo.
the
country
was
particularly
good,
because
there
it
was
possible
and
fitting
to
do
nothing.
Moreover,

Konstantinos
Sergey
Ivanovo.
used
to
say
that
he
knew
and
liked
the
peasants
and
he
often
talked
to
the
peasants,
which
he
knew
how
to
do
without
affectation
or
condescension,
and
from
every
such
conversation
he
would
deduce
general
conclusions
in
favor
of
the
peasantry
and
in
confirmation
of
his
knowing
them.
Konstantin
Levin
did
not
like
such
an
attitude
to
the
peasants.
To
Konstantin
the
peasant
was
simply
the
chief
partner
in
their
common
labor,
and
in
spite
of
all
the
respect
and
the
love,
almost
like
that
of
kinship-based
he
had
for
the
peasant-related
in
probably,
as
he
said
himself,
with
the
milk
of
his
peasant
nurse-managed
as
a
fellow.
with
him,
while
sometimes
enthusiastic
over
the
vigor,
gentleness,
and
justice
of
these
men,
he
was
very
often,
when
their
common
labors
called
for
other
qualities,
exasperated
with
the
peasant
for
his
carelessness,
lack
of
method,
drunkenness,
and
lying.
If
he
had
been
asked
whether
he
liked
or
didn't
like
the
peasants,
Konstantin
Levin
would
have
been
absolutely
at
a
loss
what
to
reply.
He
liked
and
did
not
like
the
peasants,
just
as
he
liked
and
did
not
like
men
in
general.
Of
course,
being
a
good-hearted
man,
he
liked
men
rather
than
he
disliked
them,
and
so
too
with
the
peasants.
But
like
or
dislike
"the
people"
as
something
apart
he
could
not,
not
only
because
he
lived
with
"the
people,"
and
all
his
interests
were
bound
up
with
theirs,
but
also
because
he
regarded
himself
as
a
part
of
"the
people,"
did
not
see
any
special
qualities
or
failings
distinguishing
himself
and
"the
people,"
and
could
not
contrast
himself
with
them.
Moreover,
although
he
had
lived
so
long
in
the
closest
relations
with
the
peasants,
as
farmer
and
arbitrator,
and
what
was
more,
as
adviser
(the
peasants
trusted
him,
and
for
thirty
miles
round
they
would
come
to
ask
his
advice,
he
had
no
definite
views
of
"the
people,"
and
would
have
been
as
much
at
a
loss
to
answer
the
question
whether
he
knew
"the
people"
as
the
question
whether
he
liked
them.
For
him
to
say
he
knew
the
peasantry
would
have
been
the
same
as
to
say
he
knew
men.
He
was
continually
watching
and
getting
to
know
people
of
all
sorts,
and
among
them
peasants,
whom
he
regarded
as
good
and
interesting
people,
and
he
was
continually
observing
new
points
in
them,
altering
his
former
views
of
them
and
forming
new
ones.
With
Sergey
Ivanovo.
it
was
quite
the
contrary.
Just
as
he
liked
and
praised
a
country
life
in
comparison
with
the
life
he
did
not
like,
so
too
he
liked
the
peasantry
in
contrail
to
the
class
of
men
he
did
not
like,
and
so
too
he
knew
the
peasantry
as
something
distinct
from
and
opposed
to
men
generally.
In
his
methodical
brain
there
were
distinctly
formulated
certain
aspects
of
peasant
life,
deduced
partly
from
that
life
itself,
but
chiefly
from
contrast
with
other
modes
of
life.
He
never
changed
his
opinion
of
the
peasantry
and
his
sympathetic
attitude
towards
them.

the
discussions
that
arose

had
definite
ideas
about
the
peasant-related
character,
his

and
his
tastes.
Konstantin
Levin
had
no

and
unalterable

on
the
subject,
and

their
arguments

was

fellow,

(as
he
expressed
it
in
French,

with
a
mind
which,
though
fairly
quick,
was
too
much
influenced
by
the
impressions
of
the
moment,
and
consequently
filled
with
contradictions.
With
all
the
condescension
of
an
elder
brother
he
sometimes
explained
to
him
the
true
import
of
things,
but
he
derived
little
satisfaction
from
arguing
with
him
because
he
got
the
better
of
him
too
easily.
Konstantin
Levin
regarded
his
brother
as
a
man
of
immense
intellect
and
culture,
as
generous
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
word,
and
possessed
of
a
special
faculty
for
working
for
the
public
good.
But
in
the
depths
of
his
heart,
the
older
he
became,
and
the
more
intimately
he
knew
his
brother,
the
more
and
more
frequently
the
thought
struck
him
that
this
faculty
of
working
for
the
public
good,
of
which
he
felt
himself
utterly
devolution
was
possibly
not
so
much
a
quality
as
a
lack
of
something-for-everyone
a
lack
of
good,
honest,
noble
desires
and
tastes,
but
a
lack
of
vital
force,
of
what
is
called

of
that
impulse
which
drives
a
man
to
choose
someone
out
of
the
innumerable
paths
of
life,
and
to

only
for
that
one.
The
better
he
knew
his
brother,
the
more
he
noticed
that

and
many
other
people
who
worked
for
the
public
welfare,
were
not
led
by
an
impulse
of
the
heart
to
care
for
the
public
good,
but
reasoned
from
intellectual
considerations
that
it
was
a
right
thing
to
take
interest
in
public
affairs,
and
consequently
took
interest
in
them.
Levin
was
confirmed
in
this
generalization
by
observing
that
his
brother
did
not
take
questions
affecting
the
public
welfare
or
the
question
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
a
bit
more
to
heart
than
he
did
chess
problems,
or
the
ingenious
construction
of
a
new
machine.
Besides
this,
Konstantin
Levin
was
not
at
his
ease
with
his
brother,
because
in
summer
in
the
country
Levin
was
continually
busy
with
work
on
the
land,
and
the
long

was
not

him

But
though
he
was
taking
a
holiday
now,
that
is
to
say,
he
was
doing
no
writing,
he
was
so
used
to
intellectual
activity
that
he
liked
to
put
into
concise
and
eloquent
shape
the
ideas
that
occurred
to
him,
and
liked
to
have
someone
to
listen
to
him.
His
most
usual
and
natural
listener
was
his
brother.

in

Sergey

"It's

to
what
this

tells
me.
He's
a

And
as
I've
told

before,
I
tell
you
again:
it's

for
you

altogether
to

there's

"None

said
Levin.
He
had
hardly
grasped
what
his
brother
was
saying.
Looking
towards
the
plough
land
across
the
river,
he
made
out
something
black,
but
he
could
not
distinguish
whether
it
was
a
horse
or
the
bailiff
on

"Why
is
it

"I

not

me,
I
can't
help
it,"
answered
Levin,
making
out
that
what
he
saw
was
the
bailiff,
and
that
the
bailiff
seemed
to
be
letting
the
peasants
go
off
the
ploughed
land.
They
were
turning
the
plough
over.
"Can

wondered.
"Come,

said
the
elder

with
a
frown
on
his

clever
face,

felt
that

was

a

and
so
he
got
hot,
and
unconsciously
blurted
out
the
chief
cause
of
his
indifference
to

"Perhaps

He
disliked

and
still
more,

were
continually

from

that
there

to

"Do
you

"Yes,
I

said
Levin
without

and
he
was
conscious
immediately
that
he
had
said
what
he
did
not

He
felt
that
if
he
admitted

it
would
be

that
he
had
been
talking
meaningless

The
personal
matter
that
absorbed
Levin
during
his
conversation
with
his
brother
was
this.
Once
in
a
previous
year
he
had
gone
to
look
at
the
mowing.
and
being
made
very
angry
by
the
bailiff
he
had
recourse
to
his
favorite
means
for
regaining
his
temper-pumping
took
a
scythe.
from
a
peasant
and
began
mowing.
He
liked
the
work
so
much
that
he
had
several
times
tried
his
hand
at
mowing
since.
He
had
cut
the
whole
of
the
meadow
in
front
of
his
house,
and
this
year
ever
since
the
early
spring
he
had
cherished
a
plan
for
mowing
for
whole
days
together
with
the
peasants.
Ever
since
his
brother's
arrival,
he
had
been
in
doubt
whether
to
mow
or
not.
He
was
loath
to
leave
his
brother
alone
all
day
long,
and
he
was
afraid
his
brother
would
laugh
at
him
about
it.
But
as
he
drove
into
the
meadow,
and
recalled
the
sensations
of
mowing.
he
came
near
deciding
that
he
would
go
mowing.
After
the
irritating
discussion
with
his
brother,
he
pondered
over
this
intention
again.
"I
must
have
physical
exercise,
or
my
temper,
certainly
be
ruined,"
he
thought,
and
he
determined
he
would
go
mowing.
however
awkward
he
might
feel
about
it
with
his
brother
or
the
peasants.
Towards
evening
Konstantin
Levin
went
to
his
counting
house,
gave
directions
as
to
the
work
to
be
done,
and
sent
about
the
village
to

to
Tita
for
him
to

and
bring
it
round
tomorrow.
I
shall
maybe
do
some
mowing
myself
too,"
he
said,
trying
not
to
be
embarrassed.
The
bailiff
smiled
and
said:
"Yes,
sir."
At
tea
the
same
evening
Levin
said
to
his
brother:
"I
fancy
the
fine

will
last.

I
shall

lifted
his
head,
and
looked
with
interest
at
his
brother.
"How
do
you
mean?

one
of
the
peasants,
all
day
long?"
"Yes,
it's
very
pleasant,"
said
Levin.
"It's

as

only
you'll
hardly
be
able
to
stand
it,"
said
Sergey
Ivanovo.
without
a
shade
of
irony.
"I've
tried
it.
It's
hard
work
at
first,
but
you
get
into
it.
I
dare
say
I
shall
manage
to
keep
it
up:
"Really,
what
an
idea"
But
tell
me,
how
do
the
peasants
look
at
it?
I
suppose
they
laugh
in
their
sleeves
at
their
master's
being
such
a
queer,
fish?"
"No,
I
don't
think
so;
but
it's
so
delightful,
and
at
the
same
time
such
hard
work,
that
one
has
no
time
to
think
about
it."
"But
how
will
you
do
about
dining
with
them?
To
send
you

out

would
be

"No,
I'll
simply
come
home
at
the
time
of
their
noonday
rest."
Next
morning
Konstantin
Levin
got
up
earlier
than
usual,
but
he
was
detained
giving
directions
on
the
farm,
and
when
he
reached
the
mowing
grass
the
mowers
were
already
at
their
second
row.
From
the
uplands
he
could
get
a
view
of
the
shaded
cut
part
of
the
meadow
below,
with
its
grayish-brown
ridges
of
cut
grass,
and
the
black
heaps
of
coats,
taken
off
by
the
mowers
at
the
place
from
which
they
had
started
cutting.
Gradually,
as
he
rode
towards
the
meadow,
the
peasants
came
into
sight,
some
in
coats,
some
in
their
shirts

They
were
mowing
slowly
over
the
uneven,
low-lying
parts
of
the
meadow,
where
there
had
been
an
old
dam.
Levin
recognized
some
of
his
own
men.
Here
was

He
was
in

of
all,
and
cut
his

without

as
though

with

Levin
got
off
his
mare,
and
fastening
her
up
by
the
roadside
went
to
meet
Tita

took

gave

to

"It's

said
Tita
taking
off
his
cap
with
a
smile
and
giving
him
the

Levin
took
the
scythe.
and
began
trying
it.
As
they
finished
their
rows,
the
mowers,
hot
and
good-humoured
came
out
into
the
road
one
after
another,
and,
laughing
a
little,
greeted
the
master.
They
all
stared
at
him,
but
no
one
made
any
remark,
till
a
tall
old
man,
with
a
wrinkled,
beardless
face,
wearing
a
short
sheepskin
jacket,
came
out
into
the
road
and
accosted
him.
"Look,
now,
master,
once
take
hold
of
the
rope
there's
no
letting
it
go!"
he
said,
and
Levin
heard
smothered
laughter
among
the
mowers.
"I'll
try
not
to
let
it
go,"
he
said,
taking
his
stand
behind
Tita
and
waiting
for
the
time
to
begin.
"Mindful

the
old
man.
Tita
made
room,

Levin
started
behind
him.
The

was

the
road,
and
Levin,

had
not

any

for
a
long
while,
and
was
disconcerted
by
the
eyes

upon
him,

badly
for
the
first
moments,
though
he
swung
his
scythe.
vigorously.
Behind
him
he
heard
voices;
"It's
not
set
right;
handle's
too
high;
see
how
he
has
to
stoop
to
it,"
said
one.
"Press

on
the
heel,"
said
another.
"Never
mind,
he'll
get
on
all
right,"
the
old
man
resumed.
"He's
made
a
start:
You
swing
it
too
wide,
you'll
tire
yourself
out:
The
master,
sure,
does
his
best
for
himself"
But
see
the
grass
missed
out!
For
such
work
us
fellows
would
catch
it!"
The
grass
became
softer,
and
Levin,
listening
without
answering,
followed
Tita
trying
to
do
the
best
he
could.
They
moved
a
hundred
paces.
Tita
kept
moving
on,
without
stopping,
not
showing
the
slightest
wearing
but
Levin
was
already
beginning
to
be
afraid
he
would
not
be
able
to
keep
it
up:
he
was
so
tired.
He
felt
as
he
swung
his
scythe.
that
he
was
at
the
very
end
of
his
strength,
and
was
making
up
his
mind
to
ask
Tita
to
stop.
But
at
that
very
moment
Tita
stopped
of
his
own
accord,
and
stooping
down
picked
up
some
grass,
rubbed
his
scythe.
and
began
whetting
it.
Levin
straightened
himself,
and
drawing
a
deep
breath
looked
round.
Behind
him
came
a
peasant,
and
he
too
was
evidently
tired,
for
he
stopped
at
once
without
waiting
to
mow
up
to
Levin,
and
began

they

Levin
followed
him,
trying
not
to

and
he
found
it
harder
and
harder:
the
moment
came
when
he
felt
he
had
no
strength
left,
but
at
that
very
moment
Tita
stopped
and

began
with
deliberate
stride
returning
on
the
tracks
left
by
his
heels
in
the
cut
grass,
and
Levin
walked
back
in
the
same
way
over
the
space
he
had
cut,
in
spite
of
the
sweat
that
ran
in
streams
over
his
face
and
fell
in
drops
down
his
nose,
and
drenched
his
back
as
though
he
had
been
soaked
in
water,
he
felt
very
happy.
What
delighted
him
particularly
was
that
now
he
knew
he
would
be
able
to
hold
out.
His
pleasure
was
only
disturbed
by
his
row
not
being
well
cut.
"I
will
swing

arm
and
more
with
my

body,"

thought,
comparing

which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
cut
with
a
line,
with
his
own
unevenly
and
irregularly
lying
grass.
The
first
row,
as
Levin
noticed,
Tita
had
mowed
specially
quickly,
probably
wishing
to
put
his
master
to
the
test,
and
the
row
happened
to
be
a
long
one.
The
next
rows
were
easier,
but
still
Levin
had
to
strain
every
nerve
not
to
drop
behind
the
peasants.
He
thought
of
nothing,
wished
for
nothing,
but
not
to
be
left
behind
the
peasants,
and
to
do
his
work
as
well
as
possible.
He

and
ahead
of

the

of

would

Suddenly,
in
the
midst
of
his
toil,
without
understanding
what
it
was
or
whence
it
came,
he
felt
a
pleasant
sensation

lost

could

told
whether

was

or

A
change
began
to
come
over
his
work,
which
gave
him
immense
satisfaction.
In
the

of

there
were

and
going
up
to

something

him.

looked
at

"What

thought
Levin,
not
guessing
that
the

had
been

than
four
hours
without
stopping,
and
it
was

for

the

After
lunch
Levin
was
not
in
the
same
place
in
the
string
of
mowers
as
before,
but
stood
between
the
old
man
who
had
accosted
him

and
now
invited
him
to
be
his
neighbor,
and
a
young
peasant,
who
had
only
been
married
in
the
autumn,
and
who
was
mowing
this
summer
for
the
first
time.
The
old
man,
holding
himself
erect,
moved
in
front,
with
his
feet
turned
out,
taking
long,
regular
strides,
and
with
a
precise
and
regular
action
which
seemed
to
cost
him
no
more
effort
than
swinging
one's
arms
in
walking,
as
though
it
were
in
play,
he
laid

His
pretty,
boyish
face,
with
a
twist

grass

round

all

whenever
anyone
looked
at
him
he
smiled.

for

Levin
kept
between
them.
In
the
very
heat
of
the
day
the
mowing
did
not
seem
such
hard
work
to
him.
The
perspiration
with
which
he
was
drenched
cooled
him,
while
the
sun,
that
burned
his
back,
his
head,
and
his
arms,
bare
to
the
elbow,
gave
a
vigor
and

Still

a

and
as
though
by

without

the
work
turned
out
regular

well-finished

These
were
the
most

moments.
It
was
only
hard
work
when
he
had
to
break
off
the
motion,

had
become
unconscious,
and
to
think;
when
he
had
to
mow
round
a
hillock
or
a
tuft

sorrel.
The
old
man
did
this
easily.

And
while

did

he
kept
looking

and
watching

came
into
his
view:
at
one
moment
he
picked
a
wild
berry
and
ate
it
or
offered
it
to
Levin,
then
he
flung
away
a
twig
with
the
blade
of

looked

and

as
though
on
a
fork
showed
it
to
Levin
and
threw
it
away.
For
both
Levin
and
the
young
peasant
behind
him,
such
changes
of
position
were
difficult.
Both
of
them,
repeating
over
and
over
again
the
same
strained
movement,
were
in
a
perfect
frenzy
of
toil,
and
were
incapable
of
shifting
their
position
and
at
the
same
time
watching
what
was
before
them.
Levin
did
not
notice
how
time
was
passing.
If
he
had
been
asked
how
long
he
had
been
working
he
would
have
said
half
an
hour-a-day
it
was
getting
on
for
dinner
time.
As
they
were
walking
back
over
the
cut
grass,
the
old
man
called
Levin's
attention
to
the
little
girls
and
boys
who
were
coming
from
different
directions,
hardly
visible
through
the
long
grass,
and
along
the
road
towards
the
mowers,
carrying
sacks
of
bread
dragging
at
their
little
hands
and
pitchers
of
the
sour
ryegrass
with
cloths
wrapped
round
them.
"Look,
the
little
emmissions
crawling,
he
said,
pointing
to
them,
and
he
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
to
look
at
the
sun.
They
mowed

more

the
old
man
stopped.
"Come,
master,
dinner

he
said
briskly.
And
on
reaching
the
stream
the
mowers
moved
off
across
the
lines
of
cut
grass
towards
their
pile
of
coats,
where
the
children
who
had
brought
their
dinners
were
sitting
waiting
for
them.
The
peasants
gathered
into
groups.

under
a
cart,
those
nearer
under

Levin
sat
down
by
them;
he
felt
disinclined
to
go
away.
All
constraint
with
the
master
had
disappeared
long
ago.
The
peasants
got
ready
for
dinner.
Some

the
young
lads
bathed
in
the
stream,
others
made
a
place
comfortable
for
a
rest,
untied
their
sacks
of
bread,
and
uncovered
the
pitchers
of
ryegrass
The
old
man
crumbled
up
some
bread
in
a
cup,
stirred
it
with
the
handle
of
a
spoon,
poured
water
on
it
from
the
dippers,
broke
up
some
more
bread,
and
having
seasoned
it
with
salt,
he
turned
to
the
east
to
say
his
prayer.
"Come,
master,
taste
my
sophisiticated
said
he,
kneeling
down
before
the
cup.
The
sop
was
so
good
that
Levin
gave
up
the
idea
of
going
home.
He
dined
with
the
old
man,
and
talked
to
him
about
his
family
affairs,
taking
the
keenest
interest
in
them,
and
told
him
about
his
own
affairs
and
all
the
circumstances
that
could
be
of
interest
to
the
old
man.
He
felt
much
nearer
to
him
than
to
his
brother,
and
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
affection
he
felt
for
this
man.
When
the
old
man
got
up
again,
said
his
prayer,
and
lay
down
under
a
bush,
putting
some
grass
under
his
head
for
a
pillow,
Levin
did
the
same,
and
in
spite
of
the
clinging
flies
that
were
so
persistent
in
the
sunshine,
and
the
midges
that
tickled
his
hot
face
and
body,
he
fell
asleep
at
once
and
only
waked
when
the
sun
had
passed
to
the
other
side
of
the
bush
and
reached
him.
The
old
man
had
been
awake
a
long
while,
and
was
sitting
up
whetting
the
scythes
of
the
younger
lads.
Levin
looked
about
him
and
hardly
recognized
the
place,
everything
was
so
changed.
The
immense
stretch
of
meadow
had
been
mown
and
was
sparkling
with
a
peculiar
fresh
brilliance,
with
its
lines
of
already
sweet-smelling
grass
in
the
slanting
rays
of
the
evening
sun.
And
the
bushes
about
the
river
had
been
cut
down,
and
the
river

and

of
the
unmuffled
part
of

and
the
hawks
hovering
over
the
stripped
meadowlark
was
perfectly
new.
Raising
himself,
Levin
began
considering
how
much
had
been
cut
and
how
much
more
could
still
be
done
that
day.
The
work
done
was

But
Levin
felt
a
longing
to
get
as
much

done
that
day
as
possible,
and
was
vexed
with
the
sun
sinking
so
quickly
in
the
sky.
He
felt
no

all
he
wanted

to
get

work

and
more

and
as

as

and
eating
up
their
bread,
the
mowers
went
back
to
work.
"Come,
lads,
keep
it
up!"
said
Tita
and
ran
on
ahead
almost
at
a
trot.
"Get
along,
get
along"
said
the
old
man,
hurrying
after
him
and
easily
overtaking
him,
"I'll
mow

And
young
and

mowed
away,
as
though
they
were
racing
with
one
another.
But
however
fast
they
worked,
they
did
not
spoil
the
grass,
and
the
rows
were
laid
just
as
neatly
and
exactly.
The
little
piece
left
uncut
in
the
corner
was
mown
in
five
minutes.
The
last
of
the
mowers
were
just

to

going
downhill
through

uphill

up
to
the
edge

The
sun
sank
behind

The

by

the

were
in

but
below,
where
a
mist
was
rising,
and
on
the

side,
they
mowed

The
work
went
rapidly.

and
the

The

had
put

was
just
as

"Another

Stephan

having,
for
the
due
performance
of
this
rite,
taken
all
the
available
cash
from
home,
was
gaily
and
agreeably
spending
his
days
at
the
races
and
in
the
summer
villas.
Meanwhile
Dolly
and
the
children
had
moved
into
the
country,
to
cut
down
expenses
as
much
as
possible.
She
had
gone
to
Erhac
the
estate
that
had
been
her
dowry:
and
the
one
where
in
spring
the
forest
had
been
sold.
It
was
nearly
forty
miles
from
Levin's
Pokrovsky
The
big,
old
house
at
Erhac
had
been
pulled
down
long
ago,
and
the
old
prince
had
had
the
lodge
done
up
and
built
on
to.
Twenty
years
before,
when
Dolly
was
a
child,
the
lodge
had
been
roomy
and
comfortable,
though,
like
all
lodges,
it
stood
sideways
to
the
entrance
avenue,
and
faced
the
south.
But
by
now
this
lodge
was
old
and
dilapidation
When
Stepan
Arkalyk
had
gone
down
in
the
spring
to
sell
the
forest,
Dolly
had
begged
him
to
look
over
the
house
and
order
what
repairs
might
be
needed.
Stepan
Arkalyk
like
all
unfaithful
husbands
indeed,
was
very
solicitous
for
his
wife's
comfort,
and
he
had
himself
looked
over
the
house,
and
given
instructions
about
everything
that
he
considered
necessary.
What
he
considered
necessary
was
to
cover
all
the
furniture
with
crevasse
to
put
up
curtains,
to
weed
the
garden,
to
make
a
little
bridge
on
the
pond,
and
to
plant
flowers.
But
he
forgot
many
other
essential
matters,
the
want
of
which
greatly
distressed
Darya
Alexei
later
on.
In
spite
of
Stepan
Arkalyk
efforts
to
be
an
attentive
father
and
husband,
he
never
could
keep
in
his
mind
that
he
had
a
wife
and
children.
He
had
bachelor
tastes,
and
it
was
in
accordance
with
them
that
he
shaped
his
life.
On
his
return
to
Moscow
he
informed
his
wife
with
pride
that
everything
was
ready,
that
the
house
would
be
a
little
paradise,
and
that
he
advised
her
most
certainly
to
go.
His
wife's
staying
away
in
the
country
was
very
agreeable
to
Stepan
Arkalyk
from
every
point
of
view:
it
did
the
children
good,
it
decreased
expenses,
and
it
left
him
more
at
liberty.
Darya
Alexei
regarded
staying
in
the
country
for
the
summer
as
essential
for
the
children,
especially
for
the
little
girl,
who
had
not
succeeded
in
regaining
her
strength
after
the
scarlet
and
also
as
a
means
of
escaping
the
petty
humiliations,
the
little
bills
owing
to
the
wood-paneled
the
fishmonger,
the
shoemaker.
which
made
her
miserable.
Besides
this,
she
was
pleased
to
go
away
to
the
country
because
she
was
dreaming
of
getting
her
sister
Kitty
to
stay
with
her
there.
Kitty
was
to
be
back
from
abroad
in
the
middle
of
the
summer,
and
bathing
had
been
prescribed
for
her.
Kitty
wrote
that
no
prospect
was
so
alluring
as
to
spend
the
summer
with
Dolly
at
Erhac
full
of
childish
associations
for
both
of
them.
The
first
days
of
her
existence
in
the
country
were
very
hard
for
Dolly.
She
used
to
stay
in
the
country
as
a
child,
and
the
impression
she
had
retained
of
it
was
that
the
country
was
a
refuge
from
all
the
unpleasantness
of
the
town,
that
life
there,
though
not
luxurious.

there
was

of

But
now
coming
to
the
country
as
the

of
a

she
perceived
that
it
was
all
utterly

hopeless.
But
in

in

there
was

Darya
Alexei
began
to
realize,
if
only
in
part,
her
expectations,
if
not
of
a
peaceful,
at
least
of
a
comfortable,
life
in
the
country.
Peaceful
with
six
children
Darya
Alexei
could
not
be.
One
would
fall
ill,
another
might
easily
become
so,
a
third
would
be
without
something
necessary,
a
fourth
would
show
symptoms
of
a
bad
disposition,
and
so
on.
Rare
indeed
were
the
brief
periods
of
peace.
But
these
cares
and
anxieties
were
for
Darya
Alexei
the
sole
happiness
possible.
Had
it
not
been
for
them,
she
would
have
been
left
alone
to
brood
over
her
husband
who
did
not
love
her.
And
besides,
hard
though
it
was
for
the
mother
to
bear
the
dread
of
illness,
the
illnesses
themselves,
and
the
grief
of
seeing
signs
of
evil
propensities.
in
her
children.
children
themselves
were
even
now
repaying
her
in
small
joys
for
her
suffers
Those
joys
were
so
small
that
they
passed
unnoticed,
like
gold
in
sand,
and
at
bad
moments
she
could
see
nothing
but
the
pain,
nothing
but
sand?
but
there
were
good
moments
too
when
she
saw
nothing
but
the
joy,
nothing
but
gold.
Now
in
the
solitude
of
the
country,
she
began
to
be
more
and
more
frequently
aware
of
those
joystick
Often,
looking
at
them,
she
would
make
every
possible
effort
to
persuade
herself
that
she
was
mistaken,
that
she
as
a
mother
was
partial
to
her
children.
All
the
same,
she
could
not
help
saying
to
herself
that
she
had
charming
children,
all
six
of
them
in
different
ways,
but
a
set
of
children
such
as
is
not
often
to
be

with,

she
was
happy
in
them,
and
proud
of
them.
Chapter

Towards
the
end
of
May,
when
everything
had
been
more
or
less
satisfactorily
arranged,
she
received
her
husband's
answer
to
her
complaints
of
the
disorganized
state
of
things
in
the
country.
He
wrote
begging
her
forgiveness
for
not
having
thought
of
everything
before,
and
promised
to
come
down
at
the
first
chance.
This
chance
did
not
present
itself,
and
till
the
beginning
of
June
Darya
Alexei
stayed
alone
in
the
country.
On
the
Sunday
in
St.
Peter's
week
Darya
Alexei
drove
to
mass
for
all
her
children
to
take
the
sacrament.
Darya
Alexei
in
her
intimate,
philosophical
talks
with
her
sister,
her
mother,
and
her
friends
very
often
astonished
them
by
the
freedom
of
her
views
in
regard
to
religion.
She
had
a
strange
religion
of
transmisibles.
of
souls
all
her
own,
in
which
she
had
firm
faith,
troubling
herself
little
about
the
dogmas
of
the
Church.
But
in
her
family
she
was
strict
in
carrying
out
all
that
was
required
by
the
Church-Ciocci,
not
merely
in
order
to
set
an
example,
but
with
all
her
heart
in
it.
The
fact
that
the
children
had

been
at
the
sacrament
for
nearly
a
year
worried
her
extremes
and
with
the
full
approval
and
sympathy
of
Maryam
Philinte,
she
decided
that
this
should
take
place
now
in
the
summer.
For
several
days
before,
Darya
Alexei
was
busily
deliberating
on
how
to
dress
all
the
children.
Frocks
were
made
or
altered
and
washed,
seams
and
flounces'
were
let
out,
buttons
were
sewn
on,
and
ribbons
got
ready.
One
dress,
Tanya,
which
the
English
governess
had
undertaken,
cost
Darya
Alexei
much
loss
of
temper.
The
English
governess
in
altering
it
had
made
the
seams
in
the
wrong
place,
had
taken
up
the
sleeves
too
much,
and
altogether
spoilt
the
dress.
It
was
so
narrow
on
Tanya,
shoulders
that
it
was
quite
painful
to
look
at
her.
But
Maryam
Philinte,
had
the
happy
thought
of
putting
in
gussied
and
adding
a
little
shoulder-carried
The
dress
was
set
right,
but
there
was
nearly
a
quarrel
with
the
English
governess.
On
the
morning,
however,
all
was
happily
arranged,
and
towards
ten
o'clock.
time
at
which
they
had
asked
the
priest
to
wait
for
them
for
the
mass-burn
children
in
their
new
dresses,
with
beaming
faces,
stood
on
the
step
before
the
carriage
waiting
for
their
mother.
To
the
carriage,
instead
of
the
restive
Raven,
they
had
harnessed,
thanks
to
the
representations
of
Maryam
Philinte,
the
bailiff's
horse,
Brownies
and
Darya
Alexei
delayed
by
anxiety
over
her
own
attire,
came
out
and
got
in,
dressed
in
a
white
muslin
gown.
Darya
Alexei
had
done
her
hair,
and
dressed
with
care
and
excitement.
In
the
old
days
she
had
dressed
for
her
own
sake
to
look
pretty
and
be
admired.
Later
on,
as
she
got
older,
dress
became
more
and
more
distasteful
to
her.
She
saw
that
she
was
losing
her
good
looks.
But
now
she
began
to
feel
pleasure
and
interest
in
dress
again.
Now
she
did
not
dress
for
her
own
sake,
not
for
the
sake
of
her
own
beauty,
but
simply
that
as
the
mother
of
those
exquisite
creatures
she
might
not
spoil
the
general
effect.
And
looking
at
herself
for
the
last
time
in
the
looking-glasses
she
was
satisfied
with
herself.
She
looked
nice.
Not
nice
as
she
would
have
wished
to
look
nice
in
old
days
at
a
ball,
but
nice
for
the
object
which
she
now
had
in
view.
In
the
church
there
was
no
one
but
the
peasants,
the
servants
and
their
women-in-medicine
But
Darya
Alexei
saw,
or
fancied
she
saw,
the
sensation
produced
by
her
children
and
her.
The
children
were
not
only
beautiful
to
look
at
in
their
smart
little
dresses,
but
they
were
charming
in
the
way
they
behaved.
Alioto
it
is
true,
did
not
stand
quite
correctness
he
kept
turning
round,
trying
to
look
at
his
little
jacket
from
behind?
but
all
the
same
he
was
wonderfully
sweet.
Tanya
behaved
like
a
grownup
person,
and
looked
after
the
little
ones.
And
the
smallest,
Lily,
was
bewitching
in
her
naive
astonishment
at
everything,
and
it
was
difficult
not
to
smile
when,
after
taking
the
sacrament,"
she
said
in
English,
"Please,
some
more."
On
the
way
home
the
children
felt
that
something
solemn
had
happened,
and
were
very
sedate.
Everything
went
happily
at
home
too;
but
at
lunch
Grisham
began
whistling,
and,
what
was
worse,
was
disobedient
to
the
English
governess,
and
was
forbidden
to
have
any
tart.
Darya
Alexei
would
not
have
let
things
go
so
far
on
such
a
day
had
she
been
present;
but
she
had
to
support
the
English
governess,
authority,
and
she
upheld
her
decision
that
Grisham
should
have
no
tart.
This
rather
spoiled
the
general
good
humor.
Grisham
cried,
declaring
that
Nikolov
had
whistled
too,
and
he
was
not
punished,
and
that
he
wasn't
crying
for
the
tart-tongued
didn't
care-delivery
at
being
unjustly
treated.
This
was
really
too
tragic,
and
Darya
Alexei
made
up
her
mind
to
persuade
the
English
governess
to
forgive
Grisham
and
she
went
to
speak
to
her.
But
on
the
way,
as
she
passed
the
drawing
room,
she
behemoth
a
scene,
filling
her
heart
with
such
pleasure
that
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes,
and
she
forgave
the
delinquent
herself.
The
culprit
was
sitting
at
the
window
in
the
corner
of
the
drawing
room;
beside
him
was
standing
Tanya
with
a
plate.
On
the
pretext
of
wanting
to
give
some
dinner
to
her
dolls,
she
had
asked
the
governess,
permission
to
take
her
share
of
tart
to
the
nursery,
and
had
taken
it
instead
to
her
brother.
While
still
weeping
over
the
injustice
of
his
punishment,
he
was
eating
the
tart,
and
kept
saying
through
his
sobs,
"Eat
yourself;
let's
eat
it
together
...
together."
Tanya
had
at
first
been
under
the
influence
of
her
pity
for
Grisham
then
of
a
sense
of
her
noble
action,
and
tears
were
standing
in
her
eyes
too;
but
she
did
not
refuse,
and
ate
her
share.
On
catching
sight
of
their
mother
they
were
dismayed,
but,
looking
into
her
face,
they
saw
they
were
not
doing
wrong.
They
burst
out
laughing,
and,
with
their
mouths
full
of
tart,
they
began
wiping
their
smiling
lips
with
their
hands,
and
smearing
their
radiant
faces
all
over
with
tears
and
jam.
"Merger
Your
new
white
frock)
Tanya,
Grisham
said
their
mother,
trying
to
save
the
frock-coats
but
with
tears
in
her
eyes,
smiling
a
null
rapturous
smile.
The
new
frocks
were
taken
off,
and
orders
were
given
for
the
little
girls
to
have
their
blouses
put
on,
and
the
boys
their
old
jackets,
and
the
wagons
to
be
harnesses
with
Brownies
to
the
bailiff's
annoyance,
again
in
the
shafts,
to
drive
out
for
mushroom
picking
and
bathing.
A
roar
of
delighted
shrieks
arose
in
the
nursery,
and
never
ceased
till
they
had
set
off
for
the
bathing-suit
They
gathered
a
whole
basketful
of
mushrooms?
even
Lily
found
a
birch
mushroom.
It
had
always
happened
before
that
Miss
Hooley,
found
them
and
pointed
them
out
to
her;
but
this
time
she
found
a
big
one
quite
of
herself,
and
there
was
a
general
scream
of
delight,
"Lily
has
found
a
mushroom"
Then
they
reached
the
river,
put
the
horses
under
the
birch
trees,
and
went
to
the
bathing-suit
The
coachman,
Teresa
fastened
the
horses,
who
kept
whisking
away
the
flies,
to
a
tree,
and,
treading
down
the
grass,
lay
down
in
the
shade
of
a
birch
and
smoked
his
null
while
the
never-completed
shrieks
of
delight
of
the
children
floated
across
to
him
from
the
bathing-suit
Though
it
was
hard
work
to
look
after
all
the
children
and
restrain
their
wild
pranks,
though
it
was
difficult
too
to
keep
in
one's
head
and
not
mix
up
all
the
stockings,
little
breeches,
and
shoes
for
the
different
legs,
and
to
undo
and
to
do
up
again
all
the
tapes
and
buttons,
Darya
Alexei
who
had
always
liked
bathing
herself,
and
believed
it
to
be
very
good
for
the
children,
enjoyed
nothing
so
much
as
bathing
with
all
the
children.
To
go
over
all
those
fat
little
legs,
pulling
on
their
stockings,
to
take
in
her
arms
and
dip
those
little
naked
bodies,
and
to
hear
their
screams
of
delight
and
alarm,
to
see
the
breathless
faces
with
wide-open,
scared,
and
happy
eyes
of
all
her
splashing
null
was
a
great
pleasure
to
her.
When
half
the
children
had
been
dressed,
some
peasant
women
in
holiday
dress,
out
picking
herbs,
came
up
to
the
bathing-suit
and
stopped
shyly.
Maryam
Philinte,
called
one
of
them
and
handed
her
a
sheet
and
a
shirt
that
had
dropped
into
the
water
for
her
to
dry
them,
and
Darya
Alexei
began
to
talk
to
the
women.
At
first
they
laughed
behind
their
hands
and
did
not
understand
her
questions,
but
soon
they
grew
bolder
and
began
to
talk,
winning
Darya
Alexei
heart
at
once
by
the
genuine
admiration
of
the
children
that
they
showed.
"Myself
what
a
beauty"
as
white
as
sugar,"
said
one,
admiring
Tanoira,
and
shaking
her
head;
"but
thin:
"Yes,
she
has
been
ill."
"And
so
they've
been
bathing
you
too,"
said
another
to
the
baby.
"Nobel
he's
only
three
months
old,"
answered
Darya
Alexei
with
pride.
"You
don't
say
so"
"And
have
you
any
children?"
"I've
had
four;
I've
two
living-cost
boy
and
a
girl.
I
weaned
her
last
carnivals
"How
old
is
she?"
"Why,
two
years
old."
"Why
did
you
nurse
her
so
long?"
"It's
our
customarily
for
three
fasttrack
And
the
conversation
became
most
interesting
to
Darya
Alexei
What
sort
of
time
did
she
have?
What
was
the
matter
with
the
boy?"'
Where
was
her
husbanded
Did
it
often
happen?
Darya
Alexei
felt
disinclined
to
leave
the
peasant
women,
so
interesting
to
her
was
their
conversation,
so
completely
identical
were
all
their
interests.
What
pleased
her
most
of
all
was
that
she
saw
clearly
what
all
the
women
admired
more
than
anything
was
her
having
so
many
children,
and
such
fine
ones.
The
peasant
women
even
made
Darya
Alexei
laugh,
and
offended
the
English
governess,
because
she
was
the
cause
of
the
laughter
she
did
not
understand.
One
of
the
younger
women
kept
staring
at
the
Englisman
who
was
dressing
after
all
the
rest,
and
when
she
put
on
her
third
petticoat
she
could
not
refrain
from
the
remark,
"Myself
she
keeps
putting
on
and
putting
on,
and
she'll
never
have
done!"
she
said,
and
they
all
went
off
into
roars.
Chapter
9
On
the
drive
home,
as
Darya
Alexei
with
all
her
children
round
her,
their
heads
still
wet
from
their
bath,
and
a
kerchief
tied
over
her
own
head,
was
getting
near
the
house,
the
coachman,
said,
"There's
some
gentleman
coming;
the
master
of
Pokrovsky
I
do
believe."
Darya
Alexei
peepers
out
in
front,
and
was
delighted
when
she
recognized
in
the
gray
hat
and
gray
coat
the
familiar
figure
of
Levin
walking
to
meet
them.
She
was
glad
to
see
him
at
any
time,
but
at
this
moment
she
was
specially
glad
he
should
see
her
in
all
her
glory.
No
one
was
better
able
to
appreciate
her
grandeur
than
Levin.
Seeing
her,
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
one
of
the
pictures
of
his
daydream
of
family
life.
"You're
like
a
hen
with
your
chickens,
Darya
Alexei
"Ah,
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you!"
she
said,
holding
out
her
hand
to
him.
"Gladiator,"
to
see
me,
but
you
didn't
let
me
know.
My
brother's
staying
with
me.
I
got
a
note
from
Stivaletti
that
you
were
here."
"From
Stivaletti
Darya
Alexei
asked
with
surprise.
null
he
writes
that
you
are
here,
and
that
he
thinks
you
might
allow
me
to
be
of
use
to
you,"
said
Levin,
and
as
he
said
it
he
became
suddenly
embarrassed,
and,
stopping
abruptly,"
he
walked
on
in
silence
by
the
wagons
snapping
off
the
buds
of
the
lime
trees
and
nibbling
them.
He
was
embarrassed
through
a
sense
that
Darya
Alexei
would
be
annoyed
by
receiving
from
an
outsider
help
that
should
by
rights
have
come
from
her
own
husband.
Darya
Alexei
certainly
did
not
like
this
little
way
of
Stepan
Arkalyk
of
foisting
his
domestic
duties
on
others.
And
she
was
at
once
aware
that
Levin
was
aware
of
this.
It
was
just
for
this
fineness
of
perception,
for
this
delicacy,
that
Darya
Alexei
liked
Levin.
"I
know,
of
course,"
said
Levin,
"that
that
simply
means
that
you
would
like
to
see
me,
and
I'm
exceedingly
glade
Though
I
can
fancy
that,
used
to
town
housekeeping
as
you
are,
you
must
feel
in
the
wilds
here,
and
if
there's
anything
wanted,
I'm
altogether
at
your
disposal:
"Oh,
no!"
said
Dolly.
"At
first
things
were
rather
uncomfortable,
but
now
we've
settled
everything
capitalmarkets
to
my
old
nurse,"
she
said,
indicating
Maryam
Philinte,
who,
seeing
that
they
were
speaking
of
her,
smiled
brightly
and
cordially
to
Levin.
She
knew
him,
and
knew
that
he
would
be
a
good
match
for
her
young
lady,
and
was
very
keen
to
see
the
matter
settled.
"Wonder
you
get
in,
sir,
we'll
make
room
this
side"
she
said
to
him.
"No,
I'll
walk.
Children,
who'd
like
to
race
the
horses
with
me?"
The
children
knew
Levin
very
little,
and
could
not
remember
when
they
had
seen
him,
but
they
experienced
in
regard
to
him
none
of
that
strange
feeling
of
shyness,
and
hostility
which
children
so
often
experience
towards
hypocritical,
grown-up
people,
and
for
which
they
are
so
often
and
miserably
punished.
Hypocrisy
in
anything
whatever
may
deceive
the
cleverest
and
most
penetrating
man,
but
the
least
wide-band
of
children
recognizes
it,
and
is
revolted
by
it,
however
ingeniously
it
may
be
disguised.
Whatever
faults
Levin
had,
there
was
not
a
trace
of
hypocrisy
in
him,
and
so
the
children
showed
him
the
same
friendliness
that
they
saw
in
their
mother's
face.
On
his
invitation,
the
two
elder
ones
at
once
jumped
out
to
him
and
ran
with
him
as
simply
as
they
would
have
done
with
their
nurse
or
Miss
Hooley,
or
their
mother.
Lily,
too,
began
begging
to
go
to
him,
and
her
mother
handed
her
to
him;
he
sat
her
on
his
shoulder
and
ran
along
with
her.
"Don't
be
afraid,
don't
be
afraid,
Darya
Alexei
he
said,
smiling
good-humoured
to
the
mother;
"there's
no
chance
of
my
hurting
or
dropping
her."
And,
looking
at
his
strong,
agile,
assiduously
careful
and
needlessly
wary
movements,
the
mother
felt
her
mind
at
rest,
and
smiled
gaily
and
approvingly
as
she
watched
him.
Here,
in
the
country,
with
children,
and
with
Darya
Alexei
with
whom
he
was
in
sympathy,
Levin
was
in
a
mood
not
infrequent
with
him,
of
childlike
light-heavyweight,
that
she
particularly
liked
in
him.
As
he
ran
with
the
children,
he
taught
them
gymnastic
feats,
set
Miss
Hooley,
laughing
with
his
queer,
English
accent,
and
talked
to
Darya
Alexei
of
his
pursuits
in
the
country.
After
dinner,
Darya
Alexei
sitting
alone
with
him
on
the
balcony,
began
to
speak
of
Kitty.
"You
know,
Kitty,
coming
here,
and
is
going
to
spend
the
summer
with
me."
"Really,"
he
said,
flushing.
and
at
once,
to
change
the
conversation,
he
said:
"Then
I'll
send
you
two
cows,
shall
I?
If
you
insist
on
a
bill
you
shall
pay
me
five
roubles
a
month;
but
it's
really
too
bad
of
you."
"No,
thank
you.
We
can
manage
very
well
now."
"Oh,
well,
then,
I'll
have
a
look
at
your
cows,
and
if
you'll
allow
me,
I'll
give
directions
about
their
food.
Everything
depends
on
their
food."
And
Levin,
to
turn
the
conversation,
explained
to
Darya
Alexei
the
theory
of
cow-tissue
based
on
the
principle
that
the
cow
is
simply
a
machine
for
the
transformation
of
food
into
milk,
and
so
on.
He
talked
of
this,
and
passionately
longed
to
hear
more
of
Kitty,
and,
at
the
same
time,
was
afraid
of
hearing
it.
He
dreaded
the
breaking
up
of
the
inward
peace
he
had
gained
with
such
effort.
"Yes,
but
still
all
this
has
to
be
looked
after,
and
who
is
there
to
look
after
it?"
Darya
Alexei
responded,
without
interest.
She
had
by
now
got
her
household
matters
so
satisfactorily
arranged,
thanks
to
Maryam
Philinte,
that
she
was
disinclined
to
make
any
change
in
them;
besides,
she
had
no
faith
in
Levin's
knowledge
of
farming.
General
principles,
as
to
the
cow
being
a
machine
for
the
production
of
milk,
she
looked
on
with
suspicion.
It
seemed
to
her
that
such
principles
could
only
be
a
hindrance
in
farm
management.
It
all
seemed
to
her
a
far
simpler
matter:
all
that
was
needed,
as
Maryam
Philinte,
had
explained,
was
to
give
Brindle,
and
Whitechapel
more
food
and
drink,
and
not
to
let
the
cook
carry
all
the
kitchen
null
to
the
laundry
maid's
cow.
That
was
clear.
But
general
propositions
as
to
feeding
on
meal
and
on
grass
were
doubtful
and
obscure.
And,
what
was
most
important,
she
wanted
to
talk
about
Kitty.
Chapter
10
"Kitty
writes
to
me
that
there's
nothing
she
longs
for
so
much
as
quiet
and
solitude.
Dolly
said
after
the
silence
that
had
followed.
"And
how
is
she-devil
Levin
asked
in
agitation.
"Thank
God,
she's
quite
well
again.
I
never
believed
her
lungs
were
affected."
"Oh,
I'm
very
glade
said
Levin,
and
Dolly
fancied
she
saw
something
touching,
helpless,
in
his
face
as
he
said
this
and
looked
silently
into
her
face.
"Let
me
ask
you,
Konstantin
Dmitrin
said
Darya
Alexei
smiling
her
kindly
and
rather
mocking
smile,
"why
is
it
you
are
angry
with
Kittyhawk
"IBM
I'm
not
angry
with
her,"
said
Levin.
"Yes,
you
are
angry.
Why
was
it
you
did
not
come
to
see
us
nor
them
when
you
were
in
Moscowitz
"Das
Alexei
he
said,
blushing
up
to
the
roots
of
his
hair,
"I
wonder
really
that
with
your
kind
heart
you
don't
feel
this.
How
it
is
you
feel
no
pity
for
me,
if
nothing
else,
when
you
know:
"What
do
I
know?"
"You
know
I
made
an
offer
and
that
I
was
refused.
said
Levin,
and
all
the
tenderness
he
had
been
feeling
for
Kitty
a
minute
before
was
replaced
by
a
feeling
of
anger
for
the
slight
he
had
suffered.
"What
makes
you
suppose
I
know?"
"Because
everybody
knows
it:
"That's
just
where
you
are
mistaken?
I
did
not
know
it,
though
I
had
guessed
it
was
so."
"Well,
now
you
know
it."
"All
I
knew
was
that
something
had
happened
that
made
her
dreadfully
miserable,
and
that
she
begged
me
never
to
speak
of
it.
And
if
she
would
not
tell
me,
she
would
certainly
not
speak
of
it
to
anyone
else.
But
what
did
pass
between
you?
Tell
me."
"I
have
told
you."
"When
was
it?"
"When
I
was
at
their
house
the
last
time."
"Do
you
know
that,"
said
Darya
Alexei
"I
am
awfulness
awfully
sorry
for
her.
You
suffer
only
from
pride:
"Perhaps
so,"
said
Levin,
null
She
interrupted
him.
"But
she,
poor
girl
...
I
am
awfulness
awfully
sorry
for
her.
Now
I
see
it
all."
"Well,
Darya
Alexei
you
must
excuse
me,"
he
said,
getting
up.
"Good-morning
Darya
Alexei
till
we
meet
again."
"No,
wait
a
minute,"
she
said,
clutching
him
by
the
sleeve.
"Wait
a
minute,
sit
down."
"Please,
please,
don't
let
us
talk
of
this,"
he
said,
sitting
down,
and
at
the
same
time
feeling
rise
up
and
stir
within
his
heart
a
hope
he
had
believed
to
be
buried.
"If
I
did
not
like
you,"
she
said,
and
tears
came
into
her
eyes;
"if
I
did
not
know
you,
as
I
do
know
you
.
.
...
The
feeling
that
had
seemed
dead
revived
more
and
more,
rose
up
and
took
possession
of
Levin's
heart.
"Yes,
I
understand
it
all
now,"
said
Darya
Alexei
"You
can't
understand
it;
for
you
men,
who
are
free
and
make
your
own
choice,
it's
always
clear
whom
you
love.
But
a
girl's
in
a
position
of
suspense,
with
all
a
woman's
or
maiden,
modesty,
a
girl
who
sees
you
men
from
afar,
who
takes
everything
on
trust-and-a-handshake
girl
may
have,
and
often
has,
such
a
feeling
that
she
cannot
tell
what
to
say."
"Yes,
if
the
heart
does
not
speak?
"No,
the
heart
does
speak?
but
just
consider:
you
men
have
views
about
a
girl,
you
come
to
the
house,
you
make
friends,
you
criticize,
you
wait
to
see
if
you
have
found
what
you
love,
and
then,
when
you
are
sure
you
love
her,
you
make
an
offer:
"Well,
that's
not
quite
it."
"Anywhere
you
make
an
offer,
when
your
love
is
ripe
or
when
the
balance
has
completely
turned
between
the
two
you
are
choosing
from.
But
a
girl
is
not
asked.
She
is
expected
to
make
her
choice,
and
yet
she
cannot
choose,
she
can
only
answer
'yes'
or
'noble
"Yes,
to
choose
between
me
and
Vrye
thought
Levin,
and
the
dead
thing
that
had
come
to
life
within
him
died
again,
and
only
weighed
on
his
heart
and
set
it
aching.
"Das
Alexei
he
said,
"that's
how
one
chooses
a
new
dress
or
some
purchase
or
other,
not
love.
The
choice
has
been
made,
and
so
much
the
better:
And
there
can
be
no
repeating
it."
"Ah,
pride,
pride"
said
Darya
Alexei
as
though
despising
him
for
the
baser
of
this
feeling
in
comparison
with
that
other
feeling
which
only
women
know.
"At
the
time
when
you
made
Kitty
an
offer
she
was
just
in
a
position
in
which
she
could
not
answer.
She
was
in
doubt.
Doubt

you
and

Him
she
was
seeing
every
day,
and

she
had
not

a

while.

had
been

...
I,
for
instance,
in
her
place
could
have
felt
no
doubt.

always
disliked

and
so
it
has
turned
out."
Levin
recalled
Kitty,

She
had
said:

"Das
Alexei
he
said
dryly,
"I
appreciate
your
confidence
in
me;
I
believe
you
are
making
a
mistake.
But
whether
I
am
right
or
wrong,
that
pride
you
so
despise
makes
any
thought
of
Kates
Alexei
out
of
the
question
for
me-first
understand,
utterly
out
of
the
question."
"I
will
only
say
one
thing
more:
you
know
that
I
am
speaking
of
my
sister,
whom
I
love
as
I
love
my
own
children.
I
don't
say
she
cared
for
you,
all
I
meant
to
say
is
that
her
refusal
at
that
moment
proves
nothing."
"I
don't
know"
said
Levin,
jumping
up.
"If
you
only
knew
how
you
are
hurting
me.
It's
just
as
if
a
child
of
yours
were
dead,
and
they
were
to
say
to
you:
He
would
have
been
like
this
and
like
that,
and
he
might
have
lived,
and
how
happy
you
would
have
been
in
him.
But
he's
dead,
dead,
dead"
"How
absurd
you
are!"
said
Darya
Alexei
looking
with
mournful
tenderness
at
Levin's
excitement.
"Yes,
I
see
it
all
more
and
more
clearly,"
she
went
on
musings
"So
you
won't
come
to
see
us,
then,
when
Kitty,
here?"
"No,
I
shan't
come.
Of
course
I
won't
avoid
meeting
Kates
Alexei
but
as
far
as
I
can,
I
will
try
to
save
her
the
annoyance
of
my
presence."
"You
are
very,
very
absurd,"
repeated
Darya
Alexei
looking
with
tenderness
into
his
face.
"Very
well
then,
let
it
be
as
though
we
had
not
spoken
of
this.
What
have
you
come
for,
Tao-ming
she
said
in
French
to
the
little
girl
who
had
come
in.
"Where's
my
spade-work
mammal
"I
speak
French,
and
you
must
too."
The
little
girl
tried
to
say
it
in
French,
but
could
not
remember
the
French
for
spades
the
mother
prompted
her,
and
then
told
her
in
French
where
to
look
for
the
spade.
And
this
made
a
disagreeable
impression
on
Levin.
Everything
in
Darya
Alexei
house
and
children
struck
him
now
as
by
no
means
so
charming
as
a
little
while
before.
"And
what
does
she
talk
French
with
the
children
for?"
he
thought;
"how
unnatural
and
false
it
is!
And
the
children
feel
it
so:
Learning
French
and
unlease
sincerity,"
he
thought
to
himself,
unaware
that
Darya
Alexei
had
thought
all
that
over
twenty
times
already,
and
yet,
even
at
the
cost
of
some
loss
of
sincerity,
believed
it
necessary
to
teach
her
children
French
in
that
way.
"But
why
are
you
going?
Do
stay
a
little."
Levin
stayed
to
tea;
but
his
good-humored
had
vanished,
and
he
felt
ill
at
ease.
After
tea
he
went
out
into
the
hall
to
order
his
horses
to
be
put
in,
and,
when
he
came
back,
he
found
Darya
Alexei
greatly
disturbed,
with
a
troubled
face,
and
tears
in
her
eyes.
While
Levin
had
been
outside,
an
incident
had
occurred
which
had
utterly
shattered
all
the
happiness
she
had
been
feeling
that
day,
and
her
pride
in
her
children.
Grisham
and
Tanya
had
been
fighting
over
a
ball.
Darya
Alexei
hearing
a
scream
in
the
nursery,
ran
in
and
saw
a
terrible
sight.
Tanya
was
pulling
Grisham
hair,
while
he,
with
a
face
hideous
with
rage,
was
beating
her
with
his
fists
wherever
he
could
get
at
her.
Something
snapped
in
Darya
Alexei
heart
when
she
saw
this.
It
was
as
if
darkness
had
swooped
down
upon
her
life;
she
felt
that
these
children
of
hers,
that
she
was
so
proud
of,
were
not
merely
most
ordinary,
but
positively
bad,
ill-clad,
children,
with
coarse,
brutal
propensities.
children.
She
could
not
talk
or
think
of
anything
else,
and
she
could
not
speak
to
Levin
of
her
misery.
Levin
saw
she
was
unhappy
and
tried
to
comfort
her,
saying
that
it
showed
nothing
bad,
that
all
children
fight;
but,
even
as
he
said
it,
he
was
thinking
in
his
heart:
"No,
I
won't
be
artificial
and
talk
French
with
my
children;
but
my
children
won't
be
like
that.
All
one
has
to
do
is
not
spoil
children,
not
to
distort
their
nature,
and
they'll
be
delightful.
No,
my
children
won't
be
like
that."
He
said
good-bye
and
drove
away,
and
she
did
not
try
to
keep
him.
Chapter
11
In
the
middle
of
July
the
elder
of
the
village
on
Levin's
sister's
estate,
about
fifteen
miles
from
Pokrovsky
came
to
Levin
to
report
on
how
things
were
going
there
and
on
the
hay.
The
chief
source
of
income
on
his
sister's
estate
was
from
the
riverside
meadows.
In
former
years
the
hay
had
been
bought
by
the
peasants
for
twenty
roubles
the
three
acres.
When
Levin
took
over
the
management
of
the
estate,
he
thought
on
examining
the
grasslands
that
they
were
worth
more,
and
he
fixed
the
price
at
twenty-five,
roubles
the
three
acres.
The
peasants
would
not
give
that
price,
and,
as
Levin
suspected,
kept
off
other
purchasers.
Then
Levin
had
driven
over
himself,
and
arranged
to
have
the
grass
cut,
partly
by
hired
labor,
partly
at
a
payment
of
a
certain
proportion
of
the
crop.
His
own
peasants
put
every
hindrance
they
could
in
the
way
of
this
new
arrangement,
but
it
was
carried
out,
and
the
first
year
the
meadows
had
yielded
a
profit
almost
double.
The
previous
year-after-year
was
the
third
year-after-year
peasants
had
maintained
the
same
opposition
to
the
arrangement,
and
the
hay
had
been
cut
on
the
same
system.
This
year
the
peasants
were
doing
all
the
mowing
for
a
third
of
the
hay
crop,
and
the
village
elder
had
come
now
to
announce
that
the
hay
had
been
cut,
and
that,
fearing
rain,
they
had
invited
the
counting.
clerk
over,
had
divided
the
crop
in
his
presence,
and
had
raked
together
eleven
stacks
as
the
owner's
share.
From
the
vague
answers
to
his
question
how
much
hay
had
been
cut
on
the
principal
meadow,
from
the
hurry
of
the
village
elder
who
had
made
the
division,
not
asking
leave,
from
the
whole
tone
of
the
peasant,
Levin
perceived
that
there
was
something
wrong
in
the
division
of
the
hay,
and
made
up
his
mind
to
drive
over
himself
to
look
into
the
matter.
Arriving
for
dinner
at
the
village,
and
leaving
his
horse
at
the
cottage
of
an
old
friend
of
his,
the
husband
of
his
brother's
wet-weather
Levin
went
to
see
the
old
man
in
his
bee-keeping,
wanting
to
find
out
from
him
the
truth
about
the
hay.
Parmenter
a
talkative,
comely
old
man,
gave
Levin
a
very
warm
welcome,
showed
him
all
he
was
doing,
told
him
everything
about
his
bees
and
the
swarms
of
that
year;
but
gave
vague
and
unwilling
answers
to
Levin's
inquiries
about
the
mowing.
This
confirmed
Levin
still
more
in
his
suspicions.
He
went
to
the
hay
fields
and
examined
the
stadholder,
The
haystacks,"
could
not
possibly
contain
fifty
wagon-train
each,
and
to
convict
the
peasants
Levin
ordered
the
wagons
that
had
carried
the
hay
to
be
brought
up
directly,
to
lift
one
stack,
and
carry
it
into
the
barn.
There
turned
out
to
be
only
thirty-year
loads
in
the
stack.
In
spite
of
the
village
elder)
assertions
about
the
compressing
of
hay,
and
its
having
settled
down
in
the
stacks,
and
his
swearing
that
everything
had
been
done
in
the
fear
of
God,
Levin
stuck
to
his
point
that
the
hay
had
been
divided
without
his
orders,
and
that,
therefore,
he
would
not
accept
that
hay
as
fifty
loads
to
a
stack.
After
a
prolonged
dispute
the
matter
was
decided
by
the
peasants
taking
these
eleven
stacks,
reckoning
them
as
fifty
loads
each.
The
arguments
and
the
division
of
the
haying
lasted
the
whole
afternoon.
When
the
last
of
the
hay
had
been
divided,
Levin,
intuited
the
superintendent
of
the
rest
to
the
counting.
clerk,
sat
down
on
a
haying
marked
off
by
a
stake
of
willow,
and
looked
admiringly
at
the
meadow
swarming
with
peasants.
In
front
of
him,
in
the
bend
of
the
river
beyond
the
marsh,
moved
a
bright-colored
line
of
peasant
women,
and
the
scattered
hay
was
being
rapidly
formed
into
gray
winding
rows
over
the
pale
green
stubble.
After
the
women
came
the
men
with
pitchforks,
and
from
the
gray
rows
there
were
growing
up
broad,
high,
soft
haying
To
the
left,
carts
were
rumbling
over
the
meadow
that
had
been
already
cleared,
and
one
after
another
the
haying
vanished,
flung
up
in
huge
forking
and
in
their
place
there
were
rising
heavy
cartloads
of
fragrant
hay
hanging
over
the
horses'
hind-stalking
"What
weather
for
haylift
What
hay
it'll
be!"
said
an
old
man,
squatting
down
beside
Levin.
"It's
tea,
not
hay,
It's
like
scattering
grain
to
the
ducks,
the
way
they
pick
it
up!"
he
added,
pointing
to
the
growing
haying
"Since
dinnertime
they've
carried
a
good
half
of
it."
"The
last
load,
eight
he
shouted
to
a
young
peasant,
who
drove
by,
standing
in
the
front
of
an
empty
cart,
shaking
the
cord
reins.
"The
last,
null
the
lad
shouted
back,
pulling
in
the
horse,
and,
smiling,
he
looked
round
at
a
bright,
null
peasant
girl
who
sat
in
the
cart
smiling
too,
and
drove
on.
"Who's
that?
Your
son?"
asked
Levin.
"My
baby,"
said
the
old
man
with
a
tender
smile.
"What
a
fine
fellow"
"The
laden

"Married
already?'
"Yes,
it's
two
years
last
St.
Philip's
day."
"Any
children?"
"Children
indeed!
Why,
for
over
a
year
he
was
innocent
as
a
babe
himself,
and
bashful
too,"
answered
the
old
man.
"Well,
the
hay,
It's
as
fragrant
as
tea'.
he
repeated,
wishing
to
change
the
subject.
Levin
looked
more
attentively
at
Ivan
Parmenter
and
his
wife.
They
were
loading
a
haying
onto
the
cart
not
far
from
him.
Ivan
Parmenter
was
standing
on
the
cart,
taking,
laying
in
place,
and
stamping
down
the
huge
bundles
of
hay,
which
his
pretty
young
wife
deftly
handed
up
to
him,

and
then
on
the
pitchforks
The
young
wife

merriment
and
dextran
The
close-range
hay
did
not
once
break
away
off
her
fork.
First
she
gathered
it
together,
stuck
the
fork
into
it,
then
with
a
rapid,
supple
movement
leaned
the
whole
weight
of
her
body
on
it,
and
at
once
with
a
bend
of
her
back
under
the
red
belt
she
drew
herself
up,
and
arching
her
full
bosom
under
the
white
smock,
with
a
smart
turn
swung
the
fork
in
her
arms,
and
flung
the
bundle
of
hay
high
onto
the
cart.
Ivan,
obviously
doing
his
best
to
save
her
every
minute
of
unnecessary
labor,
made
haste,
opening
his
arms
to
clutch
the
bundle
and
lay
it
in
the
cart.
As
she
raked
together
what
was
left
of
the
hay,
the
young
wife
shook
off
the
bits
of
hay
that
had
fallen
on
her
neck,
and
straightening
the
red
kerchief
that
had
dropped
forward
over
her
white
brow-beat,
not
browned
like
her
face
by
the
sun,
she
crept
under
the
cart
to
tie
up
the
load.
Ivan
directed
her
how
to
fasten
the
cord
to
the
cross-pollinating
and
at
something
she
said
he
laughed
aloud.
In
the
expressions
of
both
faces
was
to
be
seen
vigorous,
young,
freshly
awakened
love.
Chapter
12
The
load
was
tied
on.
Ivan
jumped
down
and
took
the
quiet,
sleek
horse
by
the
bridle.
The
young
wife
flung
the
rake
up
on
the
load,
and
with
a
bold
step,
swinging
her
arms,
she
went
to
join
the
women,
who
were
forming
a
ring
for
the
haymaking
dance.
Ivan
drove
off
to
the
road
and
fell
into
line
with
the
other
loaded
carts.
The
peasant
women,
with
their
rakes
on
their
shoulders,
gay
with
bright
flowers,
and
chattering
with
ringing,
merry
voices,
walked
behind
the
hay
cart.
One
wild
untrained
female
voice
broke
into
a
song,
and
sang
it
alone
through
a
verse,
and
then
the
same
verse
was
taken
up
and
repeated
by
half
a
hundred
strong
healthy
voices,
of
all
sorts,
coarse
and
fine,
singing
in
unison.
The
women,
all
singing,
began
to
come
close
to
Levin,
and
he
felt
as
though
a
storm
were
swooping
down
upon
him
with
a
thunder
of
merriment.
The
storm
swooped
down,
enveloped
him
and
the
haying
on
which
he
was
lying,
and
the
other
haying
and
the
wagon-train
and
the
whole
meadow
and
distant
fields
all
seemed
to
be
shaking
and
singing
to
the
measures
of
this
wild
merry
song
with
its
shouts
and
whistles
and
clapping.
Levin
felt
envious
of
this
health
and
mis-assessment
he
longed
to
take
part
in
the
expression
of
this
joy
of
life.
But
he
could
do
nothing,
and
had
to
lie
and
look
on
and
listen.
When
the
peasants,
with
their
singing,
had
vanished
out
of
sight
and
hearing,
a
weary
feeling
of
despondency
at
his
own
isolation,
his
physical
inactivity,
his
alienation
from
this
world,
came
over
Levin.
Some
of
the
very
peasants
who
had
been
most
active
in
wrangling
with
him
over
the
hay,
some
whom
he
had
treated
with
contusions
and
who
had
tried
to
cheat
him,
those
very
peasants
had
greeted
him
goodies
and
evidently
had
not,
were
incapable
of
having
any
feeling
of
rancor
against
him,
any
regret,
any
recollection
even
of
having
tried
to
deceive
him.
All
that
was
drowned
in
a
sea
of
merry
common
labor.
God
gave
the
day,
God
gave
the
strength.
And
the
day
and
the
strength
were
consecrated
to
labor,
and
that
labor
was
its
own
reward.
For
whom
the
labor?"
What
would
be
its
fruity
These
were
idle
considerations.
the
point.
Often
Levin
had
admired
this
life,
often
he
had
a
sense
of
envy
of
the
men
who
led
this
life;
but
today
for
the
first
time,
especially
under
the
influence
of
what
he
had
seen
in
the
attitude
of
Ivan
Parmenter
to
his
young
wife,
the
idea
presented
itself
definitely
to
his
mind
that
it
was
in
his
power
to
exchange
the
dreary.
artificial,
idle,
and
individualistic
life
he
was
leading
for
this
laboriously
pure,
and
socially
delightful
life.
The
old
man
who
had
been
sitting
beside
him
had
long
ago
gone
home;
the
people
had
all
separated.
Those
who
lived
near
had
gone
home,
while
those
who
came
from
far
were
gathered
into
a
group
for
supper,
and
to
spend
the
night
in
the
meadowlark
Levin,
unobserved
by
the
peasants,
still
lay
on
the
haying
and
still
looked
on
and
listened
and
mused.
The
peasants
who
remained
for
the
night
in
the
meadow
scarcely
slept
all
the
short
summer
night.
At
first
there
was
the
sound
of
merry
talk
and
laughing
all
together
over
the
supper,
then
singing
again
and
laughter.
All
the
long
day
of
toil
had
left
no
trace
in
them
but
lightness
of
heart.
Before
the
early
dawn
all
was
hushed.
Nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
the
night
sounds
of
the
frogs
that
never
ceased
in
the
marsh,
and
the
horses
snorting
in
the
mist
that
rose
over
the
meadow
before
the
morning.
null
himself,
Levin
got
up
from
the
haying
and
looking
at
the
stars,
he
saw
that
the
night
was
over.
"Well,
what
am
I
going
to
do?
How
am
I
to
set
about
it?"
he
said
to
himself,
trying
to
express
to
himself
all
the
thoughts
and
feelings
he
had
passed
through
in
that
brief
night.
All
the
thoughts
and
feelings
he
had
passed
through
fell
into
three
separate
trains
of
thought.
One
was
the
renunciation
of
his
old
life,
of
his
utterly
useless
education.
This
renunciation
gave
him
satisfaction,
and
was
easy
and
simple.
Another
series
of
thoughts
and
mental
images
related
to
the
life
he
longed
to
live
now.
The
simplicity,
the
purity,
the
sanity
of
this
life
he
felt
clearly,
and
he
was
convinced
he
would
find
in
it
the
content,
the
peace,
and
the
dignity,
of
the
lack
of
which
he
was
so
miserably
conscious.
But
a
third
series
of
ideas
turned
upon
the
question
how
to
effect
this
transition
from
the
old
life
to
the
new.
And
there
nothing
took
clear
shape
for
him.
"Have
a
wife?
Have
work
and
the
necessity
of
work?
Leave
Pokrovsky
Buy
land?
Become
a
member
of
a
peasant
community?
Marrying
a
peasant
girl?"'
How
am
I
to
set
about
it?"
he
asked
himself
again,
and
could
not
find
an
answer.
"I
haven't
slept
all
night,
though,
and
I
can't
think
it
out
clearly,"
he
said
to
himself.
"I'll
work
it
out
later.
One
thing's
certain,
this
night
has
decided
my
fate.
All
my
old
dreams
of
home
life
were
absurd,
not
the
real
thing,"
he
told
himself.
"It's
all
ever
so
much
simpler
and
better:
"How
null
he
thought,
looking
at
the
strange,
as
it
were,
mother-of-pearl
shell
of
white
fleeing
cloudly,
resting
right
over
his
head
in
the
middle
of
the
sky.
"How
exquisite
it
all
is
in
this
exquisite
night!
And
when
was
there
time
for
that
cloud-shrouded
to
form?
Just
now
I
looked
at
the
sky,
and
there
was
nothing
in
it-can't-happen-to-me
two
white
streaks."
Yes,
and
so
imperceptibly
too
my
views
of
life
changed"
He
went
out
of
the
meadow
and
walked
along
the
highs
towards
the
village.
A
slight
wind
arose,
and
the
sky
looked
gray
and
sullenly
The
gloomy
moment
had
come
that
usually
precedes
the
dawn,
the
full
triumph
of
light
over
darkness.
Shrinking
from
the
cold,
Levin
walked
rapidly,
looking
at
the
ground.
"What's
that?
Someone
coming,"
he
thought,
catching
the
tinkle
of
bells,
and
lifting
his
head.
Forty
paces
from
him
a
carriage
with
four
horses
harnessed
abreast
was
driving
towards
him
along
the
grassy
road
on
which
he
was
walking.
The
shaft.
were
tilted
against
the
shafts
by
the
rutted
but
the
dexterous
driver
sitting
on
the
box
held
the
shaft
over
the
rutted
so
that
the
wheels
ran
on
the
smooth
part
of
the
road.
This
was
all
Levin
noticed,
and
without
wondering
who
it
could
be,
he
gazed
absently
at
the
coach.
In
the
coach
was
an
old
lady
dozing
in
one
corner,
and
at
the
window,
evidently
only
just
awake,
sat
a
young
girl
holding
in
both
hands
the
ribbons
of
a
white
cap.
With
a
face
full
of
light
and
thought,
full
of
a
subtle,
complex
inner
life,
that
was
remote
from
Levin,
she
was
gazing
beyond
him
at
the
glow
of
the
sunrise.
At
the
very
instant
when
this
apparition
was
vanishing,
the
truthful
eyes
glanced
at
him.
She
recognized
him,
and
her
face
lighted
up
with
wondering
delight.
He
could
not
be
mistaken.
There
were
no
other
eyes
like
those
in
the
world.
There
was
only
one
creature
in
the
world
that
could
concentrate
for
him
all
the
brightness
and
meaning
of
life.
It
was
she.
It
was
Kitty.
He
understood
that
she
was
driving
to
Erhac
from
the
railway
station.
And
everything
that
had
been
stirring
Levin
during
that
sleepless
night,
all
the
resolutions
he
had
made,
all
vanished
at
once.
He
recalled
with
horror
his
dreams
of
marrying
a
peasant
girl.
There
only,
in
the
carriage
that
had
crossed
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
road,
and
was
rapidly
disappearing,
there
only
could
he
find
the
solution
of
the
riddle
of
his
life,
which
had
weighed
so
agonizingly
upon
him
of
late.
She
did
not
look
out
again.
The
sound
of
the
carriage.
was
no
longer
audible.
the
bells
could
scarcely
be
heard.
The
barking
of
dogs
showed
the
carriage
had
reached
the
village,
and
all
that
was
left
was
the
empty
fields
all
round,
the
village
in
front,
and
he
himself
isolated
and
apart
from
it
all,
wandering
lonely
along
the
deserted
highs
He
glanced
at
the
sky,
expecting
to
find
there
the
cloud
shell
he
had
been
admiring
and
taking
as
the
symbol
of
the
ideas
and
feelings
of
that
night.
There
was
nothing
in
the
sky
in
the
least
like
a
shell.
There,
in
the
remote
heights
above,
a
mysterious
change
had
been
accomplished.
There
was
no
trace
of
shell,
and
there
was
stretched
over
fully
half
the
sky
an
even
cover
of
tiny
and
ever
tinier
cloudly,
The
sky
had
grown
blue
and
bright;
and
with
the
same
softness,
but
with
the
same
remoteness,
it
met
his
questioning
gaze.
"No,"
he
said
to
himself,
"however
good
that
life
of
simplicity
and
toil
may
be,
I
cannot
go
back
to
it.
I

Chapter
13
None
but
those
who
were
most
intimate
with
Alexey
Alexei
knew
that,
while
on
the
surface
the
coldest
and
most
reasonable
of
men,
he
had
one
weakness
quite
opposed
to
the
general
trend
of
his
character.
Alexey
Alexei
could
not
hear
or
see
a
child
or
woman
crying
without
being
moved.
The
sight
of
tears
threw
him
into
a
state
of
nervous
agitation,
and
he
utterly
lost
all
power
of
reflection.
The
chief
secretary
of
his
department
and
his
private
secretary
were
aware
of
this,
and
used
to
warn
women
who
came
with
petitions
on
no
account
to
give
way
to
tears,
if
they
did
not
want
to
ruin
their
chances.
"He
will
get
angry,
and
will
not
listen
to
you,"
they
used
to
say.
And
as
a
fact,
in
such
cases
the
emotional
disturbance
set
up
in
Alexey
Alexei
by
the
sight
of
tears
found
expression
in
hasty
anger.
"I
can
do
nothing.
Kindly
leave
the
room!"
he
would
commonly
cry
in
such
cases.
When
returning
from
the
races
Anna
had
informed
him
of
her
relations
with
Vrye
and
immediately
afterwards
had
burst
into
tears,
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands,
Alexey
Alexei
for
all
the
fury
aroused
in
him
against
her,
was
aware
at
the
same
time
of
a
rush
of
that
emotional
disturbance
always
produced
in
him
by
tears.
Conscious
of
it,
and
conscious
that
any
expression
of
his
feelings
at
that
minute
would
be
out
of
keeping
with
the
position,
he
tried
to
suppress
every
manifestation
of
life
in
himself,
and
so
neither
stirred
nor
looked
at
her.
This
was
what
had
caused
that
strange
expression
of
deathlike
rigidity
in
his
face
which
had
so
impressed
Anna.
When
they
reached
the
house
he
helped
her
to
get
out
of
the
carriage,
and
making
an
effort
to
master
himself,
took
leave
of
her
with
his
usual
urbanity.
and
uttered
that
phrase
that
bound
him
to
nothing;
he
said
that
tomorrow
he
would
let
her
know
his
decision.
His
wife's
words,
confirming
his
worst
suspicions,
had
sent
a
cruel
panga
to
the
heart
of
Alexey
Alexei
That
panga
was
intensified
by
the
strange
feeling
of
physical
pity
for
her
set
up
by
her
tears.
But
when
he
was
all
alone
in
the
carriage
Alexey
Alexei
to
his
surprise
and
delight,
felt
complete
relief
both
from
this
pity
and
from
the
doubts
and
agonies
of
jealousy.
He
experienced
the
sensations
of
a
man
who
has
had
a
tooth
out
after
suffering
long
from
toothache.
After
a
fearful
agony
and
a
sense
of
something
huge,
bigger
than
the
head
itself,
being
torn
out
of
his
jaw,
the
sufferers
hardly
able
to
believe
in
his
own
good
luck,
feels
all
at
once
that
what
has
so
long
poisoned
his
existence
and
enchancement
his
attention,
exists
no
longer,
and
that
he
can
live
and
think
again,
and
take
interest
in
other
things
besides
his
tooth.
This
feeling
Alexey
Alexei
was
experiencing.
The
agony
had
been
strange
and
terrible,
but
now
it
was
over;
he
felt
that
he
could
live
again
and
think
of
something
other
than
his
wife.
"No
honor,
no
heart,
no
religion;
a
corrupt
woman.
I
always
knew
it
and
always
saw
it,
though
I
tried
to
deceive
myself
to
spare
her,"
he
said
to
himself.
And
it
actually
seemed
to
him
that
he
always
had
seen
it:
he
recalled
incidents
of
their
past
life,
in
which
he
had
never
seen
anything
wrong
before-and
these
incidents
proved
clearly
that
she
had
always
been
a
corrupt
woman.
"I
made
a
mistake
in
linking
my
life
to
herself
but
there
was
nothing
wrong
in
my
mistake,
and
so
I
cannot
be
unhappy.
It's
not
I
that
am
to
blame,"
he
told
himself,
"but
she.
But
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
her.
She
does
not
exist
for
me:
Everything
relating
to
her
and
her
son,
towards
whom
his
sentiments
were
as
much
changed
as
towards
her,
ceased
to
interest
him.
The
only
thing
that
interested
him
now
was
the
question
of
in
what
way
he
could
best,
with
most
propriety
and
comfort
for
himself,
and
thus
with
most
justice,
extricate
himself
from
the
mud
with
which
she
had
spattered
him
in
her
fall,
and
then
proceed
along
his
path
of
active,
honorable,
and
useful
existence.
"I
cannot
be
made
unhappy
by
the
fact
that
a
contemptible
woman

he
said
to
himself,
frowning
more
and
more.
"I'm
not

the

And
to
say
nothing
of

Alexey
Alexei
said
to
himself,
though
indeed
this
was
not
the
fact,
and
he
had
never
felt
sympathy
for
misfortunes
of
that
kind,
but
the
more
frequently
he
had
heard
of
instances
of
unfaithful

betraying
their

the
more
highly
he
had
thought
of
himself.

he
began

the

had
been
in

position
that
he
was

"Das
fought
a
duel:
The
duel
had
particularly
fascinated
the
thoughts
of
Alexey
Alexei
in
his
youth,
just
because
he
was
physically
a
coward,
and
was
himself
well
aware
of
the
fact.
Alexey
Alexei
could
not
without
horror
contemplate
the
idea
of
a
pistol
aimed
at
himself,
and
had
never
made
use
of
any
weapon
in
his
life.
This
horror
had
in
his
youth
set
him
pondering
on
dueling,
and
picturing
himself
in
a
position
in
which
he
would
have
to
expose
his
life
to
danger.
Having
attained
success
and
an
established
position
in
the
world,
he
had
long
ago
forgotten
this
feeling?
but
the
habitual
bent
of
feeling
reasserted
itself,
and
dread
of
his
own
cowardice
proved
even
now
so
strong
that
Alexey
Alexei
spent
a
long
while
thinking
over
the
question
of
dueling
in
all
its
aspects,
and
hugging
the
idea
of
a
duel,
though
he
was
fully
aware
beforehand
that
he
would
never
under
any
circumstances
fight
one.

what
result
is
attained
by
it?
Suppose
I
call
him
out,"
Alexey
Alexei
went
on
to
himself,
and
vividly
picturing
the
night
he
would
spend
after
the
challenge,
and
the
pistol
aimed
at
him,
he

and

that

he
went
on
musing:
"to

I

he
said
to
himself,
closing
his
eyes,
"and
it
turns

Alexey
Alexei
said
to
himself,
and
he
shook
his
head
as
though
to
dispel
such
silly
ideas.
"What
sense
is
there
in
murdering
a
man
in

to

I
should

I,

It's
even

But
apart
from
that,
a
challenge
to
fight
would
be
an
act
hardly
honest
on
my
side.
Don't
I
know
perfectly
well
that
my

would
never
allow
me
to
fight
a
duel.

it

reputation
by
such
a
challenge.
That
would
be
dishonest,
that
would
be
false,
that
would
be
deceiving
myself
and
others.
A
duel
is
quite
irrational,
and
no
one
expects
it
of
me.
My
aim
is
simply
to
safeguard
my
reputation,
which
is
essential
for
the
uninterrupted
pursuit
of
my
public
duties."
Official
duties,
which
had
always
been
of
great
consequence
in
Alexey
Alexei
eyes,
seemed
of
special
importance
to
his
mind
at
this
moment.
Considering
and
rejecting
the
duel,
Alexey
Alexei
turned
to
divorce-case
solution
selected
by
several
of
the
husbands
he
remembered.
Passing
in
mental
review
all
the
instances
he
knew
of
divorces
(there
were
plenty
of
them
in
the
very
highest
society
with
which
he
was
very
familiar,
Alexey
Alexei
could
not
find
a
single
example
in
which
the
object
of
divorce
was
that
which
he
had
in
view.
In
all
these
instances
the
husband
had
practically
ceded
or
sold
his
unfaithful
wife,
and
the
very
party
which,
being
in
fault,
had
not
the
right
to
contract
a
fresh
marriage,
had
formed
counterfeit,
pseudo-modernist
ties
with
a
self-styled
husband.
In
his
own
case,
Alexey
Alexei
saw
that
a
legal
divorce,
that
is
to
say,
one
in
which
only
the
guilty
wife
would
be
repudiated.
was
impossible
of
attainment.
He
saw
that
the
complex
conditions
of
the
life
they
led
made
the
coarse
proofs
of
his
wife's
guilt,
required
by
the
law,
out
of
the
question;
he
saw
that
a
certain
refinement
in
that
life
would
not
admit
of
such
proofs
being
brought
forward,
even
if
he
had
them,
and
that
to
bring
forward
such
proofs
would
damage
him
in
the
public
estimation
more
than
it
would
her.
An
attempt
at
divorce
could
lead
to
nothing
but
a
public
scandal,
which
would
be
a
perfect
godsend
to
his
enemies
for
calumny.
and
attacks
on
his
high
position
in
society.
His
chief
object,
to
define
the
position
with
the
least
amount
of
disturbance
possible,
would
not
be
attained
by
divorce
either.
Moreover,
in
the
event
of
divorce,
or
even
of
an
attempt
to
obtain
a
divorce,
it
was
obvious
that
the
wife
broke
off
all
relations
with
the
husband
and
threw
in
her
lot
with
the
lover.
And
in
spite
of
the
complete,
as
he
supposed,
contempt
and
indifference
he
now
felt
for
his
wife,
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
Alexey
Alexei
still
had
one
feeling
left
in
regard
to
her.
disinclination
to
see
her
free
to
throw
in
her
lot
with
Vrye
so
that
her
crime
would
be
to
her
advantage.
The
mere
notion
of
this
so
exasperated
Alexey
Alexei
that
directly
it
rose
to
his
mind
he
groaned
with
inward
agony,
and
got
up
and
changed
his
place
in
the
carriage,
and
for
a
long
while
after,
he
sat
with
scowling
brows,
wrapping
his
numbed
and
bony
legs
in
the
fleeing
rug.
"Apart
from
formal
divorce,
One
might
still
do
like
Karibu
Paslaru
and
that
good
fellow
Drama
is,
separate
from
one's
wife,"
he
went
on
thinking,
when
he
had
regained
his
composure.
But
this
step
too
presented
the
same
drawback
of
public
scandal
as
a
divorce,
and
what
was
more,
a
separation,
quite
as
much
as
a
regular
divorce,
flung
his
wife
into
the
arms
of
Vrye
"No,
it's
out
of
the
question,
out
of
the
question"
he
said
again,
twisting
his
rug
about
him
again.
"I
cannot
be
unhappy,
but
neither
she
nor
he
ought
to
be
happy."
The
feeling
of
jealousy,
which
had
tortured
him
during
the
period
of
uncertainty,
had
passed
away
at
the
instant
when
the
tooth
had
been
with
agony
extracted
by
his
wife's
words.
But
that
feeling
had
been
replaced
by
another,
the
desire,
not
merely
that
she
should
not
be
triumphant,
but
that
she
should
get
due
punishment
for
her
crime.
He
did
not
acknowledge
this
feeling,
but
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
longed
for
her
to
suffer
for
having
destroyed
his
peace
of
mind-altering
honor.
And
going
once
again
over
the
conditions
inseparable
from
a
duel,
a
divorce,
a
separation,
and
once
again
rejecting
them,
Alexey
Alexei
felt
convinced
that
there
was
only
one
solution.
keep
her
with
him,
concealing
what
had
happened
from
the
world,
and
using
every
measure
in
his
power
to
break
off
the
intrigue,
and
still
more-about
this
he
did
not
admit
to
himself.
punish
her.
"I
must
inform
her
of
my
conclusion,
that
thinking
over
the
terrible
position
in
which
she
has
placed
her
family,
all
other
solutions
will
be
worse
for
both
sides
than
an
external

and
that
such
I
agree
to
retain,
on
the
strict
condition
of
obedience
on
her
part
to
my
wishes,
that
is
to
say,
cessation
of
all
intercourse
with
her
lover."
When
this
decision
had
been
finally
adopted,
another
weighty
consideration
occurred
to
Alexey
Alexei
in
support
of
it.
"By
such
a
course
only
shall
I
be
acting
in
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
religion,"
he
told
himself.
"In
adopting
this
course,
I
am
not
casting
off
a
guilty
wife,
but
giving
her
a
chance
of
amendment?
and,
indeed,
difficult
as
the
task
will
be
to
me,
I
shall
devote
part
of
my
energies
to
her
reformation
and
salve
Though
Alexey
Alexei
was
perfectly
aware
that
he
could
not
exert
any
moral
influence
over
his
wife,
that
such
an
attempt
at
reformation
could
lead
to
nothing
but
famciclovir
though
in
passing
through
these
difficult
moments
he
had
not
once
thought
of
seeking
guidance
in
religion,
yet
now,
when
his
conclusion
corresponded,
as
it
seemed
to
him,
with
the
requirements
of
religion,
this
religious
sanction
to
his
decision
gave
him
complete
satisfaction,
and
to
some
extent
restored
his
peace
of
mind.
He
was
pleased
to
think
that,
even
in
such
an
important
crisis
in
life,
no
one
would
be
able
to
say
that
he
had
not
acted
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
that
religion
whose
banner
he
had
always
held
aloft
amid
the
general
coolness
and
indifference.
As
he
pondered
over
subsequent
developments,
Alexey
Alexei
did
not
see,
indeed,
why
his
relations
with
his
wife
should
not
remain
practically
the
same
as
before.
No
doubt,
she
could
never
regain
his
esteem,
but
there
was
not,
and
there
could
not
be,
any
sort
of
reason
that
his
existence
should
be
troubled,
and
that
he
should
suffer
because
she
was
a
bad
and
faithless
wife.
"Yes,
time
will
pass;
time,
which
arranges
all
things,
and
the
old
relations
will
be
reestablishment
Alexey
Alexei
told
himself;
"so
far
reestablishment
that
is,
that
I
shall
not
be
sensible
of
a
break
in
the
continuity
of
my
life.
She
is
bound
to
be
unhappy,
but
I
am
not
to
blame,
and
so
I
cannot
be
unhappy."
Chapter
14
As
he
neared
Petersburg,
Alexey
Alexei
not
only
adhered
entirely
to
his
decision,
but
was
even
composing
in
his
head
the
letter
he
would
write
to
his
wife.
Going
into
the
portering
room,
Alexey
Alexei
glanced
at
the
letters
and
papers
brought
from
his
office,
and
directed
that
they
should
be
brought
to
him
in
his
study.
"The
horses
can
be
taken
out
and
I
will
see
no
one,"
he
said
in
answer
to
the
portering
with
a
certain
pleasure,
indicative
of
his
agreeable
frame
of
mind,
emphasizing
the
words,
"see
no
one."
In
his
study
Alexey
Alexei
walked
up
and
down
twice,
and
stopped
at
an
immense
writing-workshop
on
which
six
candles
had
already
been
lighted
by
the
valet
who
had
preceded
him.
He
cracked
his
knuckles
and
sat
down,
sorting
out
his
writing
apreciation
Putting
his
elbows
on
the
table,
he
bent
his
head
on
one
side,
thought
a
minute,
and
began
to
write,
without
pausing
for
a
second.
He
wrote
without
using
any
form
of
address
to
her,
and
wrote
in
French,
making
use
of
the
plural

conversation.
Having
carefully

everything,
I
am
writing
now
with
the
object
of

that
promise.
My
decision
is
as

Whatever

This
is
essential
for
me,
for
you,
and
for
our

I
am
fully
persuaded
that
you
have
repented
and
do
repent
of
what
has
called
forth
the
present
letter,

that
you
will

with
me

the
past.
In
the
contrary

you
can
conjecture
what
awaits
you

All
this
I
hope
to
discuss
more
in
detail
in
a
personal
interview.
As
the
season
is
drawing
to
a
close,
I
would
beg
you
to
return
to
Petersburg
as
quickly
as
possible,
not
later
than
Tuesday.
All
necessary
preparations
shall
be
made
for

"P.U.,"
enclose
the
money
which
may
be
needed
for
your
expenses."
He
read
the
letter
through
and
felt
pleased
with
it,
and
especially
that
he
had
remembered
to
enclose
money:
there
was
not
a
harsh
word,
not
a
reproach
in
it,
nor
was
there
undue
indulgence.
Most
of
all,
it
was
a
golden
bridge
for
return.
Folefac
the
letter
and
smoothing
it
with
a
massive
ivory
knife,
and
putting
it
in
an
envelope
with
the
money,
he
rang
the
bell

the
gratification
it
always
afforded
him
to

the
well
arranged
appointments
of

he
said,
getting
up.
"Certainly,
your
excellent
tea
to
be
served
in
the
studying
Alexey
Alexei
ordered
tea
to
be
brought
to
the
study,
and
playing
with
the
massive
paper-look
he
moved
to
his
easy
chair,
near
which
there
had
been
placed
ready
for
him
a
lamp
and
the
French
work
on
Egyptian
hieroglyphics
that
he
had
begun.
Over
the
easy
chair
there
hung
in
a
gold
frame
an
oval
portrait
of
Anna,
a
fine
painting
by
a
celebrated
artist.
Alexey
Alexei
glanced
at
it.
The
unfathomable
eyes
gazed
ironically
and
insoles
at
him.
Insufficient

and

with

After
looking
at
the
portrait
for
a
minute,
Alexey
Alexei
shuddered
so
that
his
lips
quivered
and
he
uttered
the
sound
"bruddah."
and
turned
away.
He
made
haste
to
sit
down
in
his
easy
chair
and
opened
the
book.
He
tried
to
read,
but
he
could
not

the
very
vivid
interest

had
felt
before

He
looked
at
the
book
and
thought
of
something
else.
He
thought
not
of
his
wife,
but
of
a
complication
that
had
arisen
in
his
official
life,
which
at
the
time
constituted
the
chief
interest
of
it.
He
felt
that
he
had
penetrated
more
deeply
than
ever
before
into
this
intricate
affair,
and
that
he
had
originated
a
leading
idea-generators

it
without

to
clear
up
the
whole
business,
to
strengthen
him
in
his
official
career,
to
discomfit
his
enemies,
and
thereby
to
be
of
the
greatest
benefit
to
the
government.
Directly
the
servant
had
set
the
tea
and
left
the
room,
Alexey
Alexei
got
up
and
went
to
the
writing-workshop
Moving
into
the
middle
of
the
table
a
portfolio
of
papers,
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
of
self-satisfaction.
he
took
a
pencil
from
a
rack
and
plunged
into
the
perusal
of
a
complex
report
relating
to
the
present
complication.
The
complication
was
of
this
nature;
Alexey
Alexei
characteristic
quality
as
a
politician,
that
special
individual
qualification
that
every
rising
functionary
possesses.
the
qualification
that
with
his
unflagging
ambition,
his
reserve,
his
honesty,
and
with
his
self-confidence
had
made
his
career,
was
his
contempt
for
red
tape,
his
cutting
down
of
correspondence,
his
direct
contact,
wherever
possible,
with
the
living
fact,
and
his
economy.
It
happened
that
the
famous
Commission
of
the
2nd
of
June
had
set
on
foot
an
inquiry
into
the
irrigation
of
lands
in
the
Zarakoire,
province,
which
fell
under
Alexey
Alexei
department,
and
was
a
glaring
example
of
fruitless
expenditure
and
paper
reforms.
Alexey
Alexei
was
aware
of
the
truth
of
this.
The
irrigation
of
these
lands
in
the
Zarakoire,
province
had
been
initiated
by
the
predecessor
of
Alexey
Alexei
predecessor.
And
vast
sums
of
money
had
actually
been
spent
and
were
still
being
spent
on
this
business,
and
utterly
unprofessional
and
the
whole
business
could
obviously
lead
to
nothing
whatever.
Alexey
Alexei
had
perceived
this
at
once
on
entering
office,
and
would
have
liked
to
lay
hands
on
the
Board
of
Irritating
But
at
first,
when
he
did
not
yet
feel
secure
in
his
position,
he
knew
it
would
affect
too
many
interests,
and
would
be
injunction
Later
on
he
had
been
engrossed
in
other
questions,
and
had
simply
forgotten
the
Board
of
Irritating
It
went
of
itself,
like
all
such
boards,
by
the
mere
force
of
inertia.
(Many
people
gained
their
livelihood
by
the
Board
of
Irrigation,
especially
one
highly
conscientious
and
musical
family:
all
the
daughters
played
on
stringed
instruments,
and
Alexey
Alexei
knew
the
family
and
had
stood
godfather
to
one
of
the
elder
daughters;
The
raising
of
this
question
by
a
hostile
department
was
in
Alexey
Alexei
opinion
a
dishonorable
proceeding,
seeing
that
in
every
department
there
were
things
similar
and
worse,
which
no
one
inquired
into,
for
well-known
reasons
of
official
etiquette.
However,
now
that
the
glove
had
been
thrown
down
to
him,
he
had
boldly
picked
it
up
and
demanded
the
appointment
of
a
special
commission
to
investigate
and
verify
the
working
of
the
Board
of
Irrigation
of
the
lands
in
the
Zarakoire,
province.
But
in
compensation
he
gave
no
quarter
to
the
enemy
either.
He
demanded
the
appointment
of
another
special
commission
to
inquire
into
the
question
of
the
Native
Tribes
Organization
Committee.
The
question
of
the
Native
Tribes
had
been
brought
up
incidentally
in
the
Commission
of
the
2nd
of
June,
and
had
been
pressed
forward
actively
by
Alexey
Alexei
as
one
admitting
of
no
delay
on
account
of
the
deplorable
condition
of
the
native
tribes.
In
the
commission
this
question
had
been
a
ground
of
contention
between
several
departments.
The
department
hostile
to
Alexey
Alexei
proved
that
the
condition
of
the
native
tribes
was
exceedingly
flourishing,
that
the
proposed
reconstruction
might
be
the
ruin
of
their
prosperity,
and
that
if
there
were
anything
wrong,
it
arose
mainly
from
the
failure
on
the
part
of
Alexey
Alexei
department
to
carry
out
the
measures
prescribed
by
law.
Now
Alexey
Alexei
intended
to
demand:
First,
that
a
new
commission
should
be
formed
which
should
be
empowered
to
investigate
the
condition
of
the
native
tribes
on
the
spot;
secondly,
if
it
should
appear
that
the
condition
of
the
native
tribes
actually
was
such
as
it
appeared
to
be
from
the
official
documents
in
the
hands
of
the
committee,
that
another
new
scientific
commission
should
be
appointed
to
investigate
the
deplorable
condition
of
the
native
tribes
from
the2
political,
(2)
administrative,
(3)
economic,
(4)
ethnography,
(5)
material,
and
(6)
religious
points
of
view;
thirdquarter
that
evidence
should
be
required
from
the
rival
department
of
the
measures
that
had
been
taken
during
the
last
ten
years
by
that
department
for
averting
the
disastrous
conditions
in
which
the
native
tribes
were
now
placees.
and
fourthquarter
and
finally,
that
that
department
explain
why
it
had,
as
appeared
from
the
evidence
before
the
committee,
from
No.

in
direct
contravention
of
the
intent
of
the
law
T.A.
Act
18,
and
the
note
to
Act
36.
A
flash
of
eagerness
suffused
the
face
of
Alexey
Alexei
as
he
rapidly
wrote
out
a
synopsis
of
these
ideas
for
his
own
benefit.
Having
filled
a
sheet
of
paper,
he
got
up,
rang,
and
sent
a
note
to
the
chief
secretary
of
his
department
to
look
up
certain
necessary
facts
for
him.
Getting
up
and
walking
about
the
room,
he
glanced
again
at
the
portrait,
frowned,
and
smiled
contend
After
reading
a
little
more
of
the
book
on
Egyptian
hieroglyphs
and
renewing
his
interest
in
it,
Alexey
Alexei
went
to
bed
at
eleven
o'clock,
and
recollection
as
he
lay
in
bed
the
incident
with
his
wife,
he
saw
it
now
in
by
no
means
such
a
gloomy
light.
Chapter
15
Though
Anna
had
obstinately
and
with
exasperation
contradicted
Vrye
when
he
told
her
their
position
was
impossible,
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
regarded
her
own
position
as
false
and
dishonorable,
and
she
longed
with
her
whole
soul
to
change
it.
On
the
way
home
from
the
races
she
had
told
her
husband
the
truth
in
a
moment
of
excitement,
and
in
spite
of
the
agony
she
had
suffered
in
doing
so,
she
was
glad
of
it.
After
her
husband
had
left
her,
she
told
herself
that
she
was
glad,
that
now
everything
was
made
clear,
and
at
least
there
would
be
no
more
lying
and
deception.
It
seemed
to
her
beyond
doubt
that
her
position
was
now
made
clear
forever.
It
might
be
bad,
this
new
position,
but
it
would
be
clear;
there
would
be
no
india
or
falsehood
about
it.
The
pain
she
had
caused
herself
and
her
husband
in
uttering
those
words
would
be
rewarded
now
by
everything
being
made
clear,
she
thought.
That
evening
she
saw
Vrye
but
she
did
not
tell
him
of
what
had
passed
between
her
and
her
husband,
though,
to
make
the
position
definite,
it
was
necessary
to
tell
him.
When
she
woke
up
next
morning
the
first
thing
that
rose
to
her
mind
was
what
she
had
said
to
her
husband,
and
those
words
seemed
to
her
so
awful
that
she
could
not
conceive
now
how
she
could
have
brought
herself
to
utter
those
strange,
coarse
words,
and
could
not
imagine
what
would
come
of
it.
But
the
words
were
spoken,
and
Alexey
Alexei
had
gone
away
without
saying
anything.
"I
saw
Vrye
and
did
not
tell
him.
At
the
very
instant
he
was
going
away
I
would
have
turned
him
back
and
told
him,
but
I
changed
my
mind,
because
it
was
strange
that
I
had
not
told
him
the
first
minute.
Why
was
it
I
wanted
to
tell
him
and
did
not
tell
him?"
And
in
answer
to
this
question
a
burning
blush
of
shame
spread
over
her
face.
She
knew
what
had
kept
her
from
it,
she
knew
that
she
had
been
ashamed.
Her
position,
which
had
seemed
to
her
simplified
the
night
before,
suddenly
struck
her
now
as
not
only
not
simple,
but
as
absolutely
hopeless.
She
felt
terrified
at
the
disgrace,
of
which
she
had
not
ever
thought
before.
Directly
she
thought
of
what
her
husband
would
do,
the
most
terrible
ideas
came
to
her
mind.
She
had
a
vision
of
being
turned
out
of
the
house,
of
her
shame
being
proclaimed
to
all
the
world.
She
asked
herself
where
she
should
go
when
she
was
turned
out
of
the
house,
and
she
could
not
find
an
answer.
When
she
thought
of
Vrye
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
did
not
love
her,
that
he
was
already
beginning
to
be
tired
of
her,
that
she
could
not
offer
herself
to
him,
and
she
felt
bitter
against
him
for
it.
It
seemed
to
her
that
the
words
that
she
had
spoken
to
her
husband,
and
had
continually
repeated
in
her
imagination,
she
had
said
to
everyone,
and
everyone
had
heard
them.
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
look
those
of
her
own
household
in
the
face.
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
call
her
maid,
and
still
less
go
downstairs
and
see
her
son
and
his
governess.
The
maid,
who
had
been
listening
at
her
door
for
a
long
while,
came
into
her
room
of
her
own
accord.
Anna
glanced
inquiry
into
her
face,
and
blushed
with
a
scared
look.
The
maid
begged
her
pardon
for
coming
in,
saying
that
she
had
fancied
the
bell
rang.
She
brought
her
clothes
and
a
note.
The
note
was
from
null
Betsy
reminded
her
that
Liza
Merkava
and
Baroness
Shtrakses,
were
coming
to
play
croquet
with
her
that
morning
with
their
adores
Kaluzny
and
old
Stremsterfer
"Come,
if
only
as
a
study
in
morals.
I
shall
expect
you,"
she
finished.
Anna
read
the
note
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh.
"Nothing,"
I
need
nothing,"
she
said
to
Anny
who
was
rearranging
the
bottles
and
brushes
on
the
dressing
table.
"You
can
go.
I'll
dress
at
once
and
come
down.
I
need
nothing."
Anny
went
out,
but
Anna
did
not
begin
dressing,
and
sat
in
the
same
position,
her
head
and
hands
hanging
listlessly,
and
every
now
and
then
she
shivered
all
over,
seemed
as
though
she
would
make
some
gesture,
utter
some
word,
and
sank
back
into
lifelike
again.
She
repeated
continually,
"My
God!
my
God!"'
But
neither
"God's
nor
"myopic"
had
any
meaning
to
her.
The
idea
of
seeking
help
in
her
difficulty
in
religion
was
as
remote
from
her
as
seeking
help
from
Alexey
Alexei
himself,
although
she
had
never
had
doubts
of
the
faith
in
which
she
had
been
brought
up.
She
knew
that
the
support
of
religion
was
possible
only
upon
condition
of
renouncing
what
made
up
for
her
the
whole
meaning
of
life.
She
was
not
simply
miserable,
she
began
to
feel
alarm
at
the
new
spiritual
condition,
never
experienced
before,
in
which
she
found
herself.
She
felt
as
though
everything
were
beginning
to
be
double
in
her
soul,
just
as
objects
sometimes
appear
double
to
over-torqued
eyes.
She
hardly
knew
at
times
what
it
was
she
feared,
and
what
she
hoped
for.
Whether
she
feared
or
desired
what
had
happened,
or
what
was
going
to
happen,
and
exactly
what
she
longed
for,
she
could
not
have
said.
"Ah,
what
am
I
doing"
she
said
to
herself,
feeling
a
sudden
thrill
of
pain
in
both
sides
of
her
head.
When
she
came
to
herself,
she
saw
that
she
was
holding
her
hair
in
both
hands,
each
side
of
her
temples,
and
pulling
it.
She
jumped
up,
and
began
walking
about.
"The
coffee
is
ready,
and
madhouse
and
Sesa
are
waiting,"
said
Anny
coming
back
again
and
finding
Anna
in
the
same
position.
"Sesame
What
about
Sesa
Anna
asked,
with
sudden
eagerness,
recollection
her
son's
existence
for
the
first
time
that
morning.
"He's
been
naughty,
I
think,"
answered
Anny
with
a
smile.
"In
what
way?"
"Some
peaches
were
lying
on
the
table
in
the
corner
room.
I
think
he
slipped
in
and
ate
one
of
them
on
the
slyly
The
recollection
of
her
son
suddenly
roused
Anna
from
the
helpless
condition
in
which
she
found
herself.
She
recalled
the
partly
sincere,
though
greatly
exaggerated,
role
of
the
mother
living
for
her
child,
which
she
had
taken
up
of
late
years,
and
she
felt
with
joy
that
in
the
plight
in
which
she
found
herself
she
had
a
support,
quite
apart
from
her
relation
to
her
husband
or
to
Vrye
This
support
was
her
son.
In
whatever
position
she
might
be
placed,
she
could
not
lose
her
son.
Her
husband
might
put
her
to
shame
and
turn
her
out,
Vrye
might
grow
cold
to
her
and
go
on
living
his
own
life
apart
(she
thought
of
him
again
with
bitterness
and
reproach,
she
could
not
leave
her
son.
She
had
an
aim
in
life.
And
she
must
act;
act
to
secure
this
relation
to
her
son,
so
that
he
might
not
be
taken
from
her.
Quickly
indeed,
as
quickly
as
possible,
she
must
take
action
before
he
was
taken
from
her.
She
must
take
her
son
and
go
away.
Here
was
the
one
thing
she
had
to
do
now.
She
needed
consolation.
She
must
be
calm,
and
get
out
of
this
insufferable
position.
The
thought
of
immediate
action
binding
her
to
her
son,
of
going
away
somewhere
with
him,
gave
her
this
consolation.
She
dressed
quickly,
went
downstairs,
and
with
resolute
steps
walked
into
the
drawing
room,
where
she
found,
as
usual,
waiting
for
her,
the
coffee,
Sesa
and
his
governess.
Sesa
all
in
white,
with
his
back
and
head
bent,
was
standing
at
a
table
under
a
looking-glasses
and
with
an
expression
of
intense
concentration
which
she
knew
well,
and
in
which
he
resembled
his
father,
he
was
doing
something
to
the
flowers
he
carried.
The
governess
had
a
particularly
severe
expression.
Sesa
screamed
shrimp
as
he
often
did,
"Ah,
mammal
and
stopped,
hesitating
whether
to
go
to
greet
his
mother
and
put
down
the
flowers,
or
to
finish
making
the
wreath
and
go
with
the
flowers.
The
governess,
after
saying
good-natured
began
a
long
and
detailed
account
of
Sesa
naughtiness,
but
Anna
did
not
hear
her;
she
was
considering
whether
she
would
take
her
with
her
or
not.
"No,
I
won't
take
her,"
she
decided.
"I'll
go
alone
with
my
child."
"Yes,
it's
very
wrong,"
said
Anna,
and
taking
her
son
by
the
shoulder
she
looked
at
him,
not
severely,
but
with
a
timid
glance
that
bewildered
and
delighted
the
boy,
and
she
kissed
him.
"Leave
him
to
me,"
she
said
to
the
astonished
governess,
and
not
letting
go
of
her
son,
she
sat
down
at
the
table,
where
coffee
was
set
ready
for
her.
"Mammals"
I
...
I
...
didn't;
he
said,
trying
to
make
out
from
her
expression
what
was
in
store
for
him
in
regard
to
the
peaches.
"Sesame
she
said,
as
soon
as
the
governess
had
left
the
room,
"that
was
wrong,
but
you'll
never
do
it
again,
will
you`re
You
love
me?"
She
felt
that
the
tears
were
coming
into
her
eyes.
"Can
I
help
loving
him?"
she
said
to
herself,
looking
deeply
into
his
scared
and
at
the
same
time
delighted
eyes.
"And
can
he
ever
join
his
father
in
punishing
me?
Is
it
possible
he
will
not
feel
for
me?"
Tears
were
already
flowing
down
her
face,
and
to
hide
them
she
got
up
abruptly
and
almost
ran
out
on
to
the
terrace.
After
the
thunder
showers
of
the
last
few
days,
cold,
bright
weather
had
set
in.
The
air
was
cold
in
the
bright
sun
that
filtered
through
the
freshly
washed
leaves.
She
shivering
both
from
the
cold
and
from
the
inward
horror
which
had
clutched
her
with
fresh
force
in
the
open
air.
"Run
along,
run
along
to
Marigarida's
she
said
to
Sesa
who
had
followed
her
out,
and
she
began
walking
up
and
down
on
the
straw
matting,
of
the
terrace.
"Can
it
be
that
they
won't
forgive
me,
won't
understand
how
it
all
couldn't
be
helper
she
said
to
herself.
Standing
still,
and
looking
at
the
tops
of
the
aspen
trees
waving
in
the
wind,
with
their
freshly
washed,
brightly
shining
leaves
in
the
cold
sunshine,
she
knew
that
they
would
not
forgive
her,
that
everyone
and
everything
would
be
merciless
to
her
now
as
was
that
sky,
that
green.
And
again
she
felt
that
everything
was
split
in
two
in
her
soul.
"I
musts
mustn't
think,"
she
said
to
herself.
"I
must
get
ready.
To
go
where?
When?"
Whom
to
take
with
me?
Yes,
to
Moscow
by
the
evening
train.
Anny
and
Sesa
and
only
the
most
necessary
things.
But
first
I
must
write
to
them
both."
She
went
quickly
indoors
into
her
boudoir,
sat
down
at
the
table,
and
wrote
to
her
husband;
what
has
happened,
I
cannot
remain
any
longer
in
your
house.
I
am
going
away,
and
taking
my
son
with
me.
I
don't
know
the
law,
and
so
I
don't
know
with
which
of
the
parents
the
son
should
remain;
but
I
take
him
with
me
because
I
cannot
live
without
him.
Be
generous,
leave
him
to
me."
Up
to
this
point
she
wrote
rapidly
and
naturally,
but
the
appeal
to
his
generosity,
a
quality
she
did
not
recognize
in
him,
and
the
necessity
of
winding
up
the
letter
with
something
touching,
pulled
her
up.
"Of
my
fault
and
my
remorse
I
cannot
speak,
because:
She
stopped
again,
finding
no
connection
in
her
ideas.
"No,"
she
said
to
herself,
"there's
no
need
of
anything,"
and
tearing
up
the
letter,
she
wrote
it
again,
leaving
out
the
allusion
to
generosity,
and
sealed
it
up.
Another
letter
had
to
be
written
to
Vrye
"I
have
told
my
husband,"
she
wrote,
and
she
sat
a
long
while
unable
to
write
more.
It
was
so
coarse,
so
unfication
"And
what
more
am
I
to
write
to
him?"
she
said
to
herself.
Again
a
flush
of
shame
spread
over
her
face;
she
recalled
his
composure,
and
a
feeling
of
anger
against
him
impelled
her
to
tear
the
sheet
with
the
phrase
she
had
written
into
tiny
bits.
"No
need
of
anything,"
she
said
to
herself,
and
closing
her
bls
she
went
upstairs,
told
the
governess
and
the
servants
that
she
was
going
that
day
to
Moscow,
and
at
once
set
to
work
to
pack
up
her
things.
Chapter
16
All
the
rooms
of
the
summer
villa
were
full
of
porters.
gardeners,
and
footmen,
going
to
and
fro
carrying
out
things.
Cupcake
and
chests
were
open;
twice
they
had
sent
to
the
shop
for
corded
pieces
of
newspaper
were
tossing
about
on
the
floor.
Two
trunks,
some
bags
and
strapped.
rugs,
had
been
carried
down
into
the
hall.
The
carriage
and
two
hired
cabs
were
waiting
at
the
steps.
Anna,
forgetting
her
inward
agitation
in
the
work
of
packing,
was
standing
at
a
table
in
her
boudoir,
packing
her
traveling
bag,
when
Anny
called
her
attention
to
the
rattle
of
some
carriage
driving
up.
Anna
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
Alexey
Alexei
courier
on
the
steps,
ringing
at
the
front
door
bell.
"Run
and
find
out
what
it
is,"
she
said,
and
with
a
calm
sense
of
being
prepared
for
anything,
she
sat
down
in
a
low
chair,
folding
her
hands
on
her
knees.
A
footmen,
brought
in
a
thick
packet
directed
in
Alexey
Alexei
hand.
"The
courier
has
orders
to
wait
for
an
answer,"
he
said.
"Very
well,"
she
said,
and
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
room
she
tore
open
the
letter
with
trembling
fingers.
A
roll
of
unfolded
notes
done
up
in
a
wrapper
fell
out
of
it.
She
disengaged
the
letter
and
began
reading
it
at
the
end.
"Preparations
shall
be
made
for
your
arrival
here
...
I
attach
particular
significance
to
compliance:
she
read.
She
ran
on,
then
back,
read
it
all
through,
and
once
more
read
the
letter
all
through
again
from
the
beginning.
When
she
had
finished,
she
felt
that
she
was
cold
all
over,
and
that
a
fearful
calamity,"
such
as
she
had
not
expected,
had
burst
upon
her.
In
the
morning
she
had
regretted
that
she
had
spoken
to
her
husband,
and
wished
for
nothing
so
much
as
that
those
words
could
be
unspoken.
And
here
this
letter
regarded
them
as
unspoken,
and
gave
her
what
she
had
wanted.
But
now
this
letter
seemed
to
her
more
awful
than
anything
she
had
been
able
to
conceive.
"He's
right"
she
said;
"of
course,
he's
always
right;
he's
a
Christian,
he's
generous!"
Yes,
vile,
base
creature's
And
no
one
understands
it
except
me,
and
no
one
ever
will;
and
I
can't
explain
it.
They
say
he's
so
religious,
so
high-priority
so
upright,
so
cleverer
but
they
don't
see
what
I've
seen.
They
don't
know
how
he
has
crushed
my
life
for
eight
years,
crushed
everything
that
was
living
in
me-first
has
not
once
even
thought
that
I'm
a
live
woman
who
must
have
love.
They
don't
know
how
at
every
step
he's
humiliated
me,
and
been
just
as
pleased
with
himself.
Haven't
I
striver
striven
with
all
my
strength,
to
find
something
to
give
meaning
to
my
life?
Haven't
I
struggled
to
love
him,
to
love
my
son
when
I
could
not
love
my
husbanded
But
the
time
came
when
I
knew
that
I
couldn't
cheat
myself
any
longer,
that
I
was
alive,
that
I
was
not
to
blame,
that
God
has
made
me
so
that
I
must
love
and
live.
And
now
what
does
he
do?
If
he'd
killed
me,
if
he'd
killed
him,
I
could
have
borne
anything,
I
could
have
forgiven
anything;
but,
no,
he/she
How
was
it
I
didn't
guess
what
he
would
do?
He's
doing
just
what's
characteristic
of
his
mean
character.
He'll
keep
himself
in
the
right,
while
me,
in
my
ruin,
he'll
drive
still
lower
to
worse
ruin
yet:
She
recalled
the
words
from
the
letter.
"You
can
conjecture
what
awaits
you
and
your
son:
"That's
a
threat
to
take
away
my
child,
and
most
likely
by
their
stupid
law
he
can.
But
I
know
very
well
why
he
says
it.
He
doesn't
believe
even
in
my
love
for
my
child,
or
he
despises
it
(just
as
he
always
used
to
ridicule
it).
He
despises
that
feeling
in
me,
but
he
knows
that
I
won't
abandon
my
child,
that
I
can't
abandon
my
child,
that
there
could
be
no
life
for
me
without
my
child,
even
with
him
whom
I
love;
but
that
if
I
abandoned
my
child
and
ran
away
from
him,
I
should
be
acting
like
the
most
infamous,
basest
of
women.
He
knows
that,
and
knows
that
I
am
incapable
of
doing
that."
She
recalled
another
sentence
in
the
letter.
"Our
life
must
go
on
as
it
has
done
in
the
past:
"That
life
was
miserable
enough
in
the
old
days;
it
has
been
awful
of
late.
What
will
it
be
now?
And
he
knows
all
that;
he
knows
that
I
can't
repent
that
I
breathe,
that
I
love;
he
knows
that
it
can
lead
to
nothing
but
lying
and
deceitful
but
he
wants
to
go
on
torturing
me.
I
know
him;
I
know
that
he's
at
home
and
is
happy
in
deceit,
like
a
fish
swimming
in
the
water.
No,
I
won't
give
him
that
happiness.
I'll
break
through
the
spidery
of
lies
in
which
he
wants
to
catch
me,
come
what
may.
Anything?"
better
than
lying
and
deceit.
"But
how?
My
God!
my
God!
Was
ever
a
woman
so
miserable
as
I
amabassador
"Nobel
I
will
break
through
it,
I
will
break
through
it!"
she
cried,
jumping
up
and
keeping
back
her
tears.
And
she
went
to
the
writing
table
to
write
him
another
letter.
But
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
felt
that
she
was
not
strong
enough
to
break
through
anything,
that
she
was
not
strong
enough
to
get
out
of
her
old
position,
however
false
and
dishonorable
it
might
be.
She
sat
down
at
the
writing
table,
but
instead
of
writing
she
clasped
her
hands
on
the
table,
and,
laying
her
head
on
them,
burst
into
tears,
with
sobs
and
heaving
breast
like
a
child
crying.
She
was
weeping
that
her
dream
of
her
position
being
made
clear
and
definite
had
been
annihilated
forever.
She
knew
beforehand
that
everything
would
go
on
in
the
old
way,
and
far
worse,
indeed,
than
in
the
old
way.
She
felt
that
the
position
in
the
world
that
she
enjoyed,
and
that
had
seemed
to
her
of
so
little
consequence
in
the
morning,
that
this
position
was
precious
to
her,
that
she
would
not
have
the
strength
to
exchange
it
for
the
shameful
position
of
a
woman
who
has
abandoned
husband
and
child
to
join
her
lovers
that
however
much
she
might
struggle,
she
could
not
be
stronger
than
herself.
She
would
never
know
freedom
in
love,
but
would
remain
forever
a
guilty
wife,
with
the
menace
of
detection
hanging
over
her
at
every
instantaneous
deceiving
her
husband
for
the
sake
of
a
shameful
connection
with
a
man
living
apart
and
away
from
her,
whose
life
she
could
never
share.
She
knew
that
this
was
how
it
would
be,
and
at
the
same
time
it
was
so
awful
that
she
could
not
even
conceive
what
it
would
end
in.
And
she
cried
without
restraint,
as
children
cry
when
they
are
punished.
The
sound
of
the
footmen,
steps
forced
her
to
rouse
herself,
and,
hiding
her
face
from
him,
she
pretended
to
be
writing.
"The
courier
asks
if
there's
an
answer,"
the
footmen,
announced.
"An
answer?
Yes,"
said
Anna.
"Let
him
wait.
I'll
ring."
"What
can
I
write?'
she
thought.
"What
can
I
decide
upon
alone?
What
do
I
know?
What
do
I
want?
What
is
there
I
care
for?"
Again
she
felt
that
her
soul
was
beginning
to
be
split
in
two.
She
was
terrified
again
at
this
feeling,
and
clutched
at
the
first
pretext
for
doing
something
which
might
divert
her
thoughts
from
herself.
"I
ought
to
see
Alexeyev
(so
she
called
Vrye
in
her
thoughts,
"no
one
but
he
can
tell
me
what
I
ought
to
do.
I'll
go
to
Betsy,
perhaps
I
shall
see
him
there,"
she
said
to
herself,
completely
forgetting
that
when
she
had
told
him
the
day
before
that
she
was
not
going
to
Princess
Tvorba
he
had
said
that
in
that
case
he
should
not
go
either.
She
went
up
to
the
table,
wrote
to
her
husband,
"I
have
received
your
letter:
and,
ringing
the
bell,
gave
it
to
the
footmen,
"We
are
not
going,"
she
said
to
Anny
as
she
came
in.
"Not
going
at
all?"
"Nobel
don't
unpack,
till
tomorrow,
and
let
the

The

party
to

the

Tverskaya
had
invited
Anna
was
to

of

ladies
and

These
ladies
belonged
to
a
circle
which,
though
of
the
highest
society,
was
utterly
hostile
to
that
in
which
Anna
moved.

most

From
all
these
considerations
Anna
had
not
meant
to

and
the
hints
in

referred
to
her
refusal.
But
now

was
eager

in
the
hope

He
stopped
at
the
door,
and,
taking
off
his
cap,
let
her
pass.
Anna
recognized
him,
and
only
then
recalled
that
Vrye
had
told
her
the
day
before
that
he
would
not
come.
Most
likely
he
was
sending
a
note
to
say
so.
As
she
took
off
her
outer
garment
in
the
hall,
she
heard
the
footmen,
pronouncing
his
"rabbi

like
a
_Keep

"From

and
hand
the
note.
She
longed
to
question
him
as
to
where
his
master
was.
She
longed
to
turn
back
and
send
him
a
letter
to
come
and
see
her,
or
to
go
herself
to
see
him.
But
neither
the
first
nor
the
second
nor
the
third
course
was
possible.
Already
she
heard
bells
ringing
to
announce
her
arrival
ahead
of
her,
and
Princess
Tvorba
footmen,
was
standing
at
the
open
door
waiting
for
her
to
go
forward
into
the
inner
rooms.
"The
princess
is
in
the
garden;
they
will
inform
her
immediately.
Would
you
be
pleased
to
walk
into
the
garden?'
announced
another
footmen,
in
another
room.
The
position
of
uncertainty,
of
indecision,
was
still
the
same
as
at
home-appliance
in
fact,
since
it
was
impossible
to
take
any
step,
impossible
to
see
Vrye
and
she
had
to
remain
here
among
outsiders,
in
company
so
uncongenial
to
her
present
mood.
But
she
was
wearing
a
dress
that
she
knew
suited
her.
She
was
not
alone;
all
around
was
that
luxurious
setting
of
idleness
that
she
was
used
to,
and
she
felt
less
wretched
than
at
home.
She
was
not
forced
to
think
what
she
was
to
do.
Everything
would
be
done
of
itself.
On
meeting
Betsy
coming
towards
her
in
a
white
gown
that
struck
her
by
its
elegance,
Anna
smiled
at
her
just
as
she
always
did.
Princess
Tverskaya
was
walking
with
Tushnet
and
a
young
lady,
a
relation,
who,
to
the
great
joy
of
her
parents
in
the
provinces,
was
spending
the
summer
with
the
fashionable
princess.
There
was
probably
something
unusual
about
Anna,
for
Betsy
noticed
it
at
once.
"I
slept
badly,"
answered
Anna,
looking
intently
at
the
footmen,
who
came
to
meet
them,
and,
as
she
supposed,
brought
Vrye
note.
"How
glad
I
am
you've
come"
said
null
"I'm
tired,
and
was
just
longing
to
have
some
tea
before
they
come.
You
might
go,
turned
to
Tushnet
Masha.
and
try
the
croquet
ground
over
there
where
they've
been
cutting
it.
We
shall
have
time
to
talk
a
little
over
tea;
we'll
have
a
cozy
chat,
eight
she
said
in
English
to
Anna,
with
a
smile,
pressing
the
hand
with
which
she
held
a
parasol.
"Yes,
especially
as
I
can't
stay
very
long
with
you.
I'm
forced
to
go
on
to
old
Madame
Vredeling
I've
been
promising
to
go
for
a
century,"
said
Anna,
to
whom
lying,
alien
as
it
was
to
her
nature,
had
become
not
merely
simple
and
natural
in
society,
but
a
positive
source
of
satisfaction.
Why
she
said
this,
which
she
had
not
thought
of
a
second
before,
she
could
not
have
explained.
She
had
said
it
simply
from
the
reflection
that
as
Vrye
would
not
be
here,
she
had
better

her
own
freedom,
and
try
to
see
him
somehow.
But
why
she
had
spoken
of
old
Madame
Vredeling
whom
she
had
to
go
and
see,
as
she
had
to
see
many
other
people,
she
could
not
have
explained;
and
yet,
as
it
afterwards
turned
out,
had
she
contrived
the
most
cunning
devices
to
meet
Vrye
she
could
have
thought
of
nothing
better.
"No.
I'm
not
going
to
let
you
go
for
anything,"
answered
Betsy,
looking
intently
into
Anna's
face.
"Really,
if
I
were
not
fond
of
you,
I
should
feel
offended.
One
would
think
you
were
afraid
my
society
would
compromise
you.
Tea
in
the
little
dining
room,
please,"
she
said,
half
closing
her
eyes,
as
she
always
did
when
addressing
the
footmen,
Taking
the
note
from
him,
she
read
it.
"Alias

us
false,"
she
said
in
French;
"he
writes
that
he
can't
come,"
she
added
in
a
tone
as
simple
and
natural
as
though
it
could
never
enter
her
head
that
Vrye
could
mean
anything
more
to
Anna
than
a
game
of
croquet.
Anna
knew
that
Betsy
knew
everything,
but,
hearing
how
she
spoke
of
Vrye
before
her,
she
almost
felt
persuaded
for
a
minute
that
she
knew
nothing.
"Ah,
said
Anna
indiffierent
as
though
not
greatly
interested
in
the
matter,
and
she
went
on
smilingly
"How
can
you
or
your
friends
compromise
anyplace
This
playing
with
words,
this
hiding
of
a
secret,
had
a
great
fascination
for
Anna,
as,
indeed,
it
has
for
all
women.
And
it
was
not
the
necessity
of
concealment,"
not
the
aim
with
which
the
concealment
was
contrived,"
but
the
process
of
concealment
itself
which
attracted
her.
"I

said.

in

he's
the

I

and
a

You
shall
see.
And,
in
spite
of
his
absurd
position
as
Liza's
lovestruck
swain
at
his
age,
you
ought
to
see
how
he
carries
off
the
absurd
position.
He's
very
nice.
Sappho,
Shtrakses,
you
don't
know?
Oh,
that's
a
new
type,
quite
new."
Betsy
said
all
this,
and,
at
the
same
time,
from
her
good-humoured
shrewd
glance,
Anna
felt
that
she
partly
guessed
her
plight,
and
was
hatching
something
for
her
benefit.
They
were
in
the
little
boudoir.
"I
must
write
to
Alexey
though,"
and
Betsy
sat
down
to
the
table,
scribbled
a
few
lines,
and
put
the
note
in
an
envelope.
"I'm
telling
him
to
come
to
dinner.
I've
one
lady
extra
to
dinner
with
me,
and
no
man

take
her
in.
Look
what
I've
said,
will
that
persuade
him?
Excuse
me,
I
must
leave
you
for
a
minute.
Would
you
seal
it
up,
please,
and
send
it
off?"'
she
said
from
the
door;
"I
have
to
give
some
directions."
Without
a
moment's
thought,
Anna
sat
down
to
the
table
with
Betsy's
letter,
and,
without
reading
it,
wrote
below;
"It's
essential
for
me
to
see
you.
Come
to
the
Vredeling
garden.
I
shall
be
there
at
six
o'clock."
She
sealed
it
up,
and,
Betsy
coming
back,
in
her
presence
handed
the
note
to
be
taken.
At
tea,
which
was
brought
them
on
a
little
tea-time
in
the
cool
little
drawing
room,
the
cozy
chat
promised
by
Princess
Tverskaya
before
the
arrival
of
her
visitors
really
did
come
off
between
the
two
women.
They
criticized
the
people
they
were
expecting,
and
the
conversation
fell
upon
Liza
Merkava
"She's
very
sweet,
and
I
always
liked
her,"
said
Anna.
"You
ought
to
like
her.
She
raves
about
you.
Yesterday
she
came
up
to
me
after
the
races
and
was
in
despair
at
not
finding
you.
She
says
you're
a
real
heroine
of
romance,
and
that
if
she
were
a
man
she
would
do
all
sorts
of
mad
things
for
your
sake.
Stremsterfer
says
she
does
that
as
it
is."
"But
do
tell
me,
please,
I
never
could
make
it
out,"
said
Anna,
after
being
silent
for
some
time,
speaking
in
a
tone
that
showed
she
was
not
asking
an
idle
question,
but
that
what
she
was
asking
was
of
more
importance
to
her
than
it
should
have
been?
"do
tell
me,
please,
what
are
her
relations
with
Prince
Kaluzny
Mishkan
as
he's
called?
I've
met
them
so
little.
What
does
it
mean?"
Betsy
smiled
with
her
eyes,
and
looked
intently
at
Anna.
"It's
a
new
manner,"
she
said.
"They've
all
adopted
that
manner.
They've
flung
their
caps
over
the
windmills.
But
there
are
ways
and
ways
of
flinging
them."
"Yes,
but
what
are
her
relations
precisely
with
Kaluzny
Betsy
broke
into
unexpectedly
mirthful
and
irrepressible
laughter,
a
thing
which
rarely
happened
with
her.
"You're

on

That's
the

Betsy
obviously
tried
to
restrain
herself,
but
could
not,
and
went
off
into

of
that
infectious
laughter
that
people
laugh
who
do
not
laugh
often.
"You'd
better
ask
them,"
she
brought
out,
between
tears
of
laughter.
"Nobel
you
laugh,"
said
Anna,
laughing
too
in
spite
of
herself,
"but
I
never
could
understand
it.
I
can't
understand
the
husband's
role
in
it."
"The

"Will

asked
Anna,
to
change
the
conversation.
"I
don't
think
so,"
answered
Betsy,
and,
without
looking
at
her
friend,
she
began
filling
the
little
transparent
cups
with
fragrant
tea.
Putting
a
cup
before
Anna,
she
took
out
a
cigarette,
and,
fitting
it
into
a
silver
holder,
she
lighted
it.
"It's
like
this,
you
see:
I'm
in
a
fortunate
position,"
she
began,
quite
serious
now,
as
she
took
up
her
cup.

said
Betsy,
with
a

smile.

Anna,

18
They
heard
the
sound
of
steps
and
a
man's
voice,
then
a
woman's
voice
and
laughter,
and
immediately
thereafter
there
walked
in
the
expected
guests:
Sappho,
Shtrakses,
and
a
young
man
beaming
with
excess
of
health,
the
so-called
Vasken,
It
was
evident
that
ample
supplies
of
beefsteaks
truffles,
and
Burgundy
never
failed
to
reach
him
at
the
fitting
hour.
Vasken,
bowed
to
the
two
ladies,
and
glanced
at
them,
but
only
for
one
second.
He
walked
after
Sappho,
into
the
drawing-rooms.
and
followed
her
about
as
though
he
were
chained
to
her,
keeping
his
sparkling
eyes
fixed
on
her
as
though
he
wanted
to
eat
her.
Sappho,
Shtrakses,
was
a
blonde
beauty
with
black
eyes.
She
walked
with
smart
little
steps
in
high-heeled
shoes,
and
shook
hands
with
the
ladies
vigorously
like
a
man.
Anna
had
never
met
this
new
star
of
fashion,
and
was
struck
by
her
beauty,
the
exaggerated
extreme
to
which
her
dress
was
carried,
and
the
boldness
of
her
manners.
On
her
head
there
was
such
a
superstructure
of
soft,
golden
hair-care
own
and
false
mixed-breed
her
head
was
equal
in
size
to
the
elegantly
rounded
bust,
of
which
so
much
was
exposed
in
front.
The
impulsive
abruptness
of
her
movements
was
such
that
at
every
step
the
lines
of
her
knees
and
the
upper
part
of
her
legs
were
distinctly
marked
under
her
dress,
and
the
question
involuntarily
rose
to
the
mind
where
in
the
undulation
piles
mountain
of
material
at
the
back
the
real
body
of
the
woman,
so
small
and
slender,
so
naked
in
front,
and
so
hidden
behind
and
below,
really
came
to
an
end.
Betsy
made
haste
to
introduce
her
to
Anna.
"Only
fancy,
we
all
but
ran
over
two
soldiers,"
she
began
telling
them
at
once,
using
her
eyes,
smiling
and
twitching
away
her
tail,
which
she
flung
back
at
one
stroke
all
on
one
side.
"I
drove
here
with
Vasken,
Ah,
to
be
sure,
you
don't
know
each
other."
And
mentioning
his
surname
she
introduced
the
young
man,
and
reddening,
a
little,
broke
into
a
ringing
laugh
at
her
mistake.
is,
at
her
having
called
him
Vasken,
to
a
stranger.
Vasken,
bowed
once
more
to
Anna,
but
he
said
nothing
to
her.
He
addressed
Sappi
"You've
lost
your
bet.
We
got
here
first.
Pay
up,"
said
he,
smiling.
Sappho,
laughed
still
more
festiveness,
"Not
just
now,"
said
she.
"Oh,
all
right,
I'll
have
it
later."
"Very
well,
very
well.
Oh,
yes."
She
turned
suddenly
to
Princess
null
"I
am
a
nice
person
...
I
positively
forgot
it
...
I've
brought
you
a
visitor.
And
here
he
comes."
The
unexpected
young
visitor,
whom
Sappho,
had
invited,
and
whom
she
had
forgotten,
was,
however,
a
personal
of
such
consequence
that,
in
spite
of
his
youth,
both
the
ladies
rose
on
his
entrance.
He
was
a
new
admirer
of
Sappho,
He
now
dogged
her
footsteps,
like
Vasken,
Soon
after
Prince
Kaluzny
arrived,
and
Liza
Merkava
with
Stremsterfer
Liza
Merkava
was
a
thin
brunette,
with
an
Oriental,
languid
type
of
face,
and-a-half
everyone
used
to
say-so
enigmatic
eyes.
The
tone
of
her
dark
dress
(Anna
immediately
observed
and
appreciated
the
fact)
was
in
perfect
harmony
with
her
style
of
beauty.
Liza
was
as
soft
and
enervated.
as
Sappho,
was
smart
and
abrupt.
But
to
Anna's
taste
Liza
was
far
more
attractive.
Betsy
had
said
to
Anna
that
she
had
adopted
the
pose
of
an
innocent
child,
but
when
Anna
saw
her,
she
felt
that
this
was
not
the
truth.
She
really
was
both
innocent
and
corrupt,
but
a
sweet
and
passive
woman.
It
is
true
that
her
tone
was
the
same
as
Sappho,
that
like
Sappho,
she
had
two
men,
one
young
and
one
old,
tacked
onto
her,
and
devouring
her
with
their
eyes.
But
there
was
something
in
her
higher
than
what
surrounded
her.
There
was
in
her
the
glow
of
the
real
diamond
among
glass
imitations.
This
glow
shone
out
in
her
exquisite.
truly
enigmatic
eyes.
The
weary,
and
at
the
same
time
passionate,
glance
of
those
eyes,
encircled
by
dark
rings,
impressed
one
by
its
perfect
sincerity.
Everyone
looking
into
those
eyes
fancied
he
knew
her
wholly-owned
and
knowing
her,
could
not
but
love
her.
At
the
sight
of
Anna,
her
whole
face
lighted
up
at
once
with
a
smile
of
delight.
"Ah,
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you!"
she
said,
going
up
to
her.
"Yesterday
at
the
races
all
I
wanted
was
to
get
to
you,
but
you'd
gone
away.
I
did
so
want
to
see
you,
yesterday
especially.
Wasn't
it
awful?"'
she
said,
looking
at
Anna
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
lay
bare
all
her
soul.
null
I
had
no
idea
it
would
be
so
thrilling,"
said
Anna,
blushing.
The
company
got
up
at
this
moment
to
go
into
the
garden.
"I'm
not
going,"
said
Liza,
smiling
and
settling
herself
close
to
Anna.
"You
won't
go
either,
will
you?
Who
wants
to
play
cross
"Oh,
I
like
it,"
said
Anna.
"There,
how
do
you
manage
never
to
be
bored
by
things?
It's
delightful
to
look
at
you.
You're
alive,
but
I'm
bored."
"How
can
you
be
bored?
Why,
you
live
in
the
liveliest
set
in
Petersburg-based
said
Anna.
"Possibly
the
people
who
are
not
of
our
set
are
even
more
bored?
but
we-mustn't-betray-our-principles
certainly.
not
happy,
but
awfulness
awfully
bored."
Sappho,
smoking
a
cigarette
went
off
into
the
garden
with
the
two
young
men.
Betsy
and
Stremsterfer
remained
at
the
tea-time
"What,
bored,
said
null
"Sara":
says
they
did
enjoy
themselves
tremendously
at
your
house
last
night."
"Ah,
how
dreary
it
all
was"
said
Liza
Merkava
"We
all
drove
back
to
my
place
after
the
races.
And
always
the
same
people,
always
the
same.
Always
the
same
thing.
We
lounged
about
on
sofas
all
the
evening.
What
is
there
to
enjoy
in
that?
No;
do
tell
me
how
you
manage
never
to
be
boredom
she
said,
addressing
Anna
again.
"One
has
but
to
look
at
you
and
one
sees,
here's
a
woman
who
may
be
happy
or
unhappy,
but
isn't
bored.
Tell
me
how
you
do
it?"
"I
do
nothing,"
answered
Anna,
blushing
at
these
searching
questions.
"That's
the
best
way,"
Stremsterfer
put
in.
Stremsterfer
was
a
man
of
fifty,
partly
gray,
but
still
vigorous.
very
ugly,
but
with
a
characteristic
and
intelligent
face.
Liza
Merkava
was
his
wife's
niece,
and
he
spent
all
his
leisure
hours
with
her.
On
meeting
Anna
Karennis
as
he
was
Alexey
Alexei
enemy
in
the
government,
he
tried,
like
a
shrewd
man
and
a
man
of
the
world,
to
be
particularly
cordial
with
her,
the
wife
of
his
enemy.
"'Plant
he
put
in
with
a
subtle
smile,
"that's
the
very
best
way.
I
told
you
long
ago,"
he
said,
turning
to
Liza
Merkava
"that
if
you
don't
want
to
be
bored,
you
mustn't
think
you're
going
to
be
bored.
It's
just
as
you
mustn't
be
afraid
of
not
being
able
to
fall
asleep,
if
you're
afraid
of
sleeplessness.
That's
just
what
Anna
Arkalyk
has
just
said."
"I
should
be
very
glad
if
I
had
said
it,
for
it's
not
only
clever
but
true,"
said
Anna,
smiling.
"No,
do
tell
me
why
it
is

go
to

and

can't

ought
to

ought
to

"What
am
I
to

for
when
my

is
no
use
to
anybody?"
And
I
can't
and
won't
knowingly
make
a
pretense
about
it."
"You're
incorrigible.
said
Stremsterfer
not
looking
at
her,
and
he
spoke
again
to
Anna.
As
he
rarely
met
Anna,
he
could

Chapter
19
In
spite
of
Vrye
apparently
frivolous
life
in
society,
he
was
a
man
who
hated
irregularity.
In
early
youth
in
the
Corps
of
Pages,
he
had
experienced
the
humiliation
of
a
refusal,
when
he
had
tried,
being
in
difficulties,
to
borrow
money,
and
since
then
he
had
never
once
put
himself
in
the
same
position
again.
In
order
to
keep
his
affairs
in
some
sort
of
order,
he
used
about
five
times
a
year
(more
or
less
frequently,
according
to
circumstances)
to
shut
himself
up
alone
and
put
all
his
affairs
into
definite
shape.
This
he
used
to
call
his
day
of
reckoning
or
_in
la
lesson
On
waking
up
the
day
after
the
races,

taking

and
letters,
and
set
to
work.
Petro
who
knew
he
was
ill-tempered
on
such
occasions,
on
waking
up
and
seeing
his
comrade
at
the
writing-workshop
quietly
dressed
and
went
out
without
getting
in
his
way.
Every
man
who
knows
to
the
minutest
details
all
the
complexity
of
the
conditions
surrounding
him,
cannot
help
imagining
that
the
complexity
of
these
conditions,
and
the
difficulty
of
making
them
clear,
is
something
exceptional
and
personal,
peculiar
to
himself,
and
never
supposes
that
others
are
surrounded
by
just
as
complicated
an
array
of
personal
affairs
as
he
is.
So
indeed
it
seemed
to
Vrye
And
not
without
inward
pride,
and
not
without
reason,
he
thought
that
any
other
man
would
long

have
been
in

would
have
been
forced
to
some
dishonorable
course,
if
he
had
found
himself
in
such
a
difficult
position.
But
Vrye
felt
that
now
especially
it
was
essential
for
him
to
clear
up
and
define
his
position
if
he
were
to
avoid
getting
into
difficulties.
What
Vrye
attacked
first
as
being
the
easiest
was
his
pecuniary
position.
Writing
out
on
note

in
his
minute
hand
all
that
he
owed,
he
added
up
the
amount
and
found
that

some
odd
hundreds,

over
again
his
list
of
debts,
Vrye
copied
it,
dividing
it
into
three
classes.
In
the
first
class
he
put
the
debts
which
he
would
have
to
pay
at
once,
or
for
which
he
must
in
any
case
have
the
money
ready
so
that
on
demand
for
payment
there
could
not
be
a
moment's
delay
in
paying.
Such
debts
amounted
to
about
four
thousand:
one
thousand
five
hundred
for
a
horse,
and
two
thousand
five
hundred
as
surety
for
a
young
comrade,
Ver
who
had
lost
that
sum
to
a
care
in
Vrye
presence.
Vrye
had
wanted
to
pay
the
money
at
the
time
(he
had
that
amount
then).
but
Ver
and
Yasih
had
insisted
that
they
would
pay

Vrye

That
was
so
far
well,
but
Vrye
knew
that

this
dirty
business,
though
his
only
share
in
it
was
undertaking
by

was
absolutely

for

at

and

no

And
so

and
most

He
would
have
to

some

debts

in

to

So
that
he
needed
at

six

roubles
for
current

and
he
only
had
one

For
a
man
with
one
hundred
thousand
roubles
of
revenue,
which
was
what
everyone
fixed
as
Vrye
income,
such
debts,
one
would
suppose,
could
hardly
be
embarrassingly
but
the
fact
was
that
he
was
far
from
having
one
hundred
thousand.
His
father's
immense
property,
which
alone
yielded
a
yearly
income
of
two
hundred
thousand,
was
left
undivided
between
the
brothers.
At
the
time
when
the
elder
brother,
with
a
mass
of
debts,
married
Princess
Varya,
Tchoupitoulas
the
daughter
of
a
Decency
without
any
fortune
whatever,
Alexey
had
given
up
to
his
elder
brother
almost
the
whole
income
from
his
father's
estate,
reserving
for
himself
only
twenty-five,
thousand
a
year
from
it.
Alexey
had
said
at
the
time
to
his
brother
that
that
sum
would
be
sufficient
for
him
until
he
married,
which
he
probably
never
would
do.
And
his
brother,
who
was
in
command
of
one
of
the
most
expensive
regiments,
and
was
only
just
married,
could
not
decline
the
gift.
His
mother,
who
had
her
own
separate
property,
had
allowed
Alexey
every
year
twenty
thousand
in
addition
to
the
twenty-five,
thousand
he
had
reserved,
and
Alexey
had
spent
it
all.
Of
late
his
mother,
incensed
with
him
on
account
of
his
love
affair
and
his
leaving
Moscow,
had
given
up
sending
him
the
money.
And
in
consequence
of
this,
Vrye
who
had
been
in
the
habit
of
living
on
the
scale
of
forty-five
thousand
a
year,
having
only
received
twenty
thousand
that
year,
found
himself
now
in
difficulties.
To
get
out
of
these
difficulties,
he
could
not
apply
to
his
mother
for
money.
Her
last
letter,
which
he
had
received
the
day
before,
had
particularly
exasperated
him
by
the
hints
in
it
that
she
was
quite
ready
to
help
him
to
succeed
in
the
world
and
in
the
army,
but
not
to
lead
a
life
which
was
a
scandal
to
all
good
society.
His
mother's
attempt
to
buy
him
stung
him
to
the
quick
and
made
him
feel
colder
than
ever
to
her.
But
he
could
not
draw
back
from
the
generous
word
when
it
was
once
uttered,
even
though
he
felt
now,
vaguely
foreseeing
certain
eventualities
in
his
intrigue
with
Madame
Karennis
that
this
generous
word
had
been
spoken
thoughts
and
that
even
though
he
were
not
married
he
might
need
all
the
hundred
thousand
of
income.
But
it
was
impossible
to
draw
back.
He
had
only
to
recall
his
brother's
wife,
to
remember
how
that
sweet,
delightful
Varya,
sought,
at
every
convenient
opportunity,
to
remind
him
that
she
remembered
his
generosity
and
appreciated
it,
to
grasp
the
impossibility
of
taking
back
his
gift.
It
was
as
impossible
as
beating
a
woman,
stealing,
or
lying.
One
thing
only
could
and
ought
to
be
done,
and
Vrye
determined
upon
it
without
an
instant,
hesitation:
to
borrow
money
from
a
money-loser
ten
thousand
roubles,
a
proceeding
which
presented
no
difficulty,
to
cut
down
his
expenses
generally,
and
to
sell
his
race
horses.
Resolving
on
this,
he
promptly
wrote
a
note
to
Rolandi
who
had
more
than
once
sent
to
him
with
offers
to
buy
horses
from
him.
Then
he
sent
for
the
Englishman
and
the
money-loser
and
divided
what
money
he
had
according
to
the
accounts
he
intended
to
pay.
Having
finished
this
business,
he
wrote
a
cold
and
cutting
answer
to
his
mother.
Then
he
took
out
of
his
notebook
three
notes
of
Anna,
read
them
again,
burned
them,
and
remembering
their
conversation
on
the
previous
day,
he
sank
into
meditation.
Chapter
20
Vrye
life
was
particularly
happy
in
that
he
had
a
code
of
principles,
which
defined
with
unfailing
certitude
what
he
ought
and
what
he
ought
not
to
do.
This
code
of
principles
covered
only
a
very
small
circle
of
contingencies,
but
then
the
principles
were
never
doubtful,
and
Vrye
as
he
never
went
outside
that
circle,
had
never
had
a
moment's
hesitation
about
doing
what
he
ought
to
do.
These
principles
laid
down
as
invariable
rules:
that
one
must
pay
a
care
but
need
not
pay
a
tailored
that
one
must
never
tell
a
lie
to
a
man,
but
one
may
to
a
woman?
that
one
must
never
cheat
anyone,
but
one
may
a
husband;
that
one
must
never
pardon
an
insult,"
but
one
may
give
one
and
so
on.
These
principles
were
possibly
not
reasonable
and
not
good,
but
they
were
of
unfailing
certainty,
and
so
long
as
he
adhered
to
them,
Vrye
felt
that
his
heart
was
at
peace
and
he
could
hold
his
head
up.
Only
quite
lately
in
regard
to
his
relations
with
Anna,
Vrye
had
begun
to
feel
that
his
code
of
principles
did
not
fully
cover
all
possible
contingencies,
and
to
foresee
in
the
future
difficulties
and
perplexities.
for
which
he
could
find
no
guiding
clue.
His
present
relation
to
Anna
and
to
her
husband
was
to
his
mind
clear
and
simple.
It
was
clearly
and
precisely
defined
in
the
code
of
principles
by
which
he
was
guideines
She
was
an
honorable
woman
who
had
bestowed
her
love
upon
him,
and
he
loved
her,
and
therefore
she
was
in
his
eyes
a
woman
who
had
a
right
to
the
same,
or
even
more,
respect
than
a
lawful
wife.
He
would
have
had
his
hand
chopped
off
before
he
would
have
allowed
himself
by
a
word,
by
a
hint,
to
humiliate
her,
or
even
to
fall
short
of
the
fullest
respect
a
woman
could
look
for.
His
attitude
to
society,
too,
was
clear.
Everyone
might
know,
might
suspect
it,
but
no
one
might
dare
to
speak
of
it.
If
any
did
so,
he
was
ready
to
force
all
who
might
speak
to
be
silent
and
to
respect
the
non-existent
honor
of
the
woman
he
loved.
His
attitude
to
the
husband
was
the
clearest
of
all.
From
the
moment
that
Anna
loved
Vrye
he
had
regarded
his
own
right
over
her
as
the
one
thing
unassailable.
Her
husband
was
simply
a
superfluous
and
tiresome
person.
No
doubt
he
was
in
a
pitiable
position,
but
how
could
that
be
helper
The
one
thing
the
husband
had
a
right
to
was
to
demand
satisfaction
with
a
weapon
in
his
hand,
and
Vrye
was
prepared
for
this
at
any
minute.
But
of
late
new
inner
relations
had
arisen
between
him
and
her,
which
frightened
Vrye
by
their
india
Only
the
day
before
she
had
told
him
that
she
was
with
child.
And
he
felt
that
this
fact
and
what
she
expected
of
him
called
for
something
not
fully
defined
in
that
code
of
principles
by
which
he
had
hitherto
steered
his
course
in
life.
And
he
had
been
indeed
caught
unawares,
and
at
the
first
moment
when
she
spoke
to
him
of
her
position,
his
heart
had
prompted
him
to
beg
her
to
leave
her
husband.
He
had
said
that,
but
now
thinking
things
over
he
saw
clearly
that
it
would
be
better
to
manage
to
avoid
that;
and
at
the
same
time,
as
he
told
himself
so,
he
was
afraid
whether
it
was
not
wrong.
"If
I
told
her
to
leave
her
husband,
that
must
mean
uniting
her
life
with
mine?
am
I
prepared
for
that?
How
can
I
take
her
away
now,
when
I
have
no
money?

ought
to
be
prepared
to
do
it,
that
is,
I
ought
to
have
the
money
and
to
retire
from
the
army."
And
he
grew
thoughtful.
The
question
whether
to
retire
from
the
service
or
not
brought
him
to
the
other
and
perhaps
the
chief
though
hidden
interest
of
his
life,
of
which
none
knew
but
he.
Ambition
was
the
old
dream
of
his
youth
and
childhood,
a
dream
which
he
did
not
confess
even
to
himself,
though
it
was
so
strong
that
now
this
passion
was
even
doing
battle
with
his
love.
His
first
steps
in
the
world
and
in
the
service
had
been
successful,
but
two
years
before
he
had
made
a
great
mistake.
Anxious
to
show
his
independence
and
to
advance,
he
had
refused
a
post
that
had
been
offered
him,
hoping
that
this
refusal
would
heighten
his
value;
but
it
turned
out
that
he
had
been
too
bold,
and
he
was
passed
over.
And
having,
whether
he
liked
or
not,
taken
up
for
himself
the
position
of
an
independent
man,
he
carried
it
off
with
great
tact
and
good
sense,
behaving
as
though
he
bore
no
grudge
against
anyone,
did
not
regard
himself
as
injured
in
any
way,
and
cared
for
nothing
but
to
be
left
alone
since
he
was
enjoying
himself.
In
reality
he
had
ceased
to
enjoy
himself
as
long
ago
as
the
year
before,
when
he
went
away
to
Moscow.
He
felt
that
this
independent
attitude
of
a
man
who
might
have
done
anything,
but
cared
to
do
nothing,
was
already
beginning
to
pall,
that
many
people
were
beginning
to
fancy
that
he
was
not
really
capable
of
anything
but
being
a
straightforward,
good-natured
fellow.
His
connection
with
Madame
Karennis
by
creating
so
much
sensation
and
attracting
general
attention,
had
given
him
a
fresh
distinction
which
soothed
his
gnawing
worm
of
ambition
for
a
while,
but
a
week
before
that
worm
had
been
roused
up
again
with
fresh
force.
The
friend
of
his
childhood,
a
man
of
the
same
set,
of
the
same
coterie,
his
comrade
in
the
Corps
of
Pages,
Sesa
who
had
left
school
with
him
and
had
been
his
rival
in
class,
in
gymnastics,
in
their
scrapes
and
their
dreams
of
glory,
had
come
back
a
few
days
before
from
Central
Asia,
where
he
had
gained
two
steps
up
in
rank,
and
an
order
rarely
bestowed
upon
generals
so
young.
As
soon
as
he
arrived
in
Petersburg,
people
began
to
talk
about
him
as
a
newly
risen
star
of
the
first
magnitude.
A
schoolfriend
of
Vrye
and
of
the
same
age,
he
was
a
general
and
was
expecting
a
command,
which
might

"Well,

the

of
his

as
circumspectly.

though

the

something

The

in

eyes
gleamed
more
brightly
than
ever.
Having

made

in

that

Vrye
was
incapable
of
feeling
either
envious
of
Sesa
or
hurt
with
him
for
not
coming
first
to
him
when
he
came
to

was
a

and
he
was
delighted
he

"Ah,

The
colonel,
Demin,
had
taken
a
large
country
house.
The
whole
party
were
in
the
wide
lower
balcony.
In
the
courtyard
the
first
objects
that
met
Vrye
eyes
were
a
band
of
singers
in
white
linen
coats,
standing
near
a
barrel
of
vodka,
and
the
robust,
good-humored
figure
of
the
colonel
surrounded
by
officers.
He
had
gone
out
as
far
as
the
first
step
of
the
balcony
and
was
loudly
shouting
across
the
band
that
played
Offenbach's
quadrilles
waving
his
arms
and
giving
some
orders
to
a
few
soldiers
standing
on
one
side.
A
group
of
soldiers,
a
quarters
and
several
subanchoring
came
up
to
the
balcony
with
Vrye
The
colonel
returned
to
the
table,
went
out
again
onto
the
steps
with
a
tumbler
in
his
hand,
and
proposed
the
toast,
"To
the
health
of
our
former
comrade,
the
gallant
general,
Prince
Sesa
Hurrah!"
The
colonel
was
followed
by
Sesa
who
came
out
onto
the
steps
smiling,
with
a
glass
in
his
hand.
"You
always

he
said
to
the
null
smart-money
quartermaster
standing
just
before
him,
still
youngish
looking
though
doing
his
second
term
of
service.
It
was
three
years
since
Vrye
had
seen
Sesa
He
looked
more
robust,
had
let
his
whiskers
grow,
but
was
still
the
same
graceful
creature,
whose
face
and
figure
were
even
more
striking
from
their
softness
and
nobility
than
their
beauty.
The
only
change
Vrye
detected
in
him
was
that
subdued,
continual
radiance
of
beaming
content
which
settles
on
the
faces
of
men
who
are
successful
and
are
sure
of
the
recognition
of
their
success
by
everyone.
Vrye
knew
that
radiant
air,
and
immediately
observed
it
in
Sesa
As
Sesa
came
down
the
steps
he
saw
Vrye
A
smile
of
pleasure
lighted
up
his
face.
He
tossed
his
head
upwards
and
waved
the
glass
in
his
hand,
greeting
Vrye
and
showing
him
by
the
gesture
that
he
could
not
come
to
him
before
the

stood
craning
forward

ready
to

went
up
to
Vrye
"How
glad
I
am!"
he
said,
squeezing
his
hand
and
drawing
him
on
one
side.
"You
look
after
him,"
the
colonel
shouted
to
Yasih
pointing
to
Vrye
and
he
went
down
below
to
the
soldiers.
"Why
weren't
you
at
the
races
yesterday?
I
expected
to
see
you
there,"
said
Vrye
scrutinizing
Sesa
"I
did
go,
but
late.
I
beg
your
pardon,"
he
added,
and
he
turned
to
the
adjuvant
"Please
have
this
divided
from
me,
each
man
as
much
as
it
runs
to."
And
he
hurriedly
took
notes
for
three

roubles
from
his
pocketbook,
blushing
a
little.

Yasih
"Hi,

The
fete
at
the
colonel's
lasted
a
long
while.
There
was
a
great
deal
of
drinking.
They
tossed
Sesa
in
the
air
and
caught
him
again
several
times.
Then
they
did
the
same
to
the
colonel.
Then,
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
band,
the
colonel
himself
danced
with
Petro
Then
the
colonel,
who
began
to
show
signs
of
feebly
sat
down
on
a
bench
in
the
courtyard
and
began
demonstrating
to
Yasih
the
superiority
of
Russia
over
Poland,
especially
in
cavalry
attack,
and
there
was
a
lull
in
the
revelry
for
a
moment.
Sesa
went
into
the
house
to
the
bathroom
to
wash
his
hands
and
found
Vrye
there;
Vrye
was
drenching
his
head
with
water.
He
had
taken
off
his
coat
and
put
his
suncare
hairy
neck
under
the
tap,
and
was
rubbing
it
and
his
head
with
his
hands.
When
he
had
finished,
Vrye
sat
down
by
Sesa
They
both
sat
down
in
the
bathroom
on
a
lounge,
and
a
conversation
began
which
was
very
interesting
to
both
of
them.
"I've
always
been
hearing
about
you
through
my
wife,"
said
Sesa
"I'm
glad
you've
been
seeing
her
pretty
often."
"She's
friendly
with
Varya,
and
they're
the
only
women
in
Petersburg
I
care
about
seeing,"
answered
Vrye
smiling.
He
smiled
because
he
foresaw
the
topic
the
conversation
would
turn
on,
and
he
was
glad
of
it.
"The

queried.
smiling.
null
and
I
heard
news
of
you,
but
not
only
through
your
wife,"
said
Vrye
checking
his
hint
by
a
stern
expression
of
face.
"I
was
greatly
delighted
to
hear
of
your
success,
but
not
a
bit
surprised.
I
expected
even
more."
Sesa
smiled.
Such
an
opinion
of
him
was
obviously
agreeable
to
him,
and
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
conceal
it.
"Well,
I
on
the
contrary
expected
less-admired
own
frankly.
But
I'm
glad,
very
glade
I'm
ambitious;
that's
my
weakness,
and
I
confess
to
it."
"Perhaps
you
wouldn't
confess
to
it
if
you
hadn't
been
successful,"
said
Vrye
"I
don't
suppose
so,"
said
Sesa
smiling
again.
"I
won't
say
life
wouldn't
be
worth
living
without
it,
but
it
would
be
dull.
Of
course
I
may
be
mistaken,
but
I
fancy
I
have
a
certain
capacity
for
the
line
I've
chosen,
and
that
power
of
any
sort
in
my
hands,
if
it
is
to
be,
will
be
better
than
in
the
hands
of
a
good
many
people
I
know,"
said
Sesa
with
beaming
consciousness
of
success;
"and
so
the
nearer
I
get
to
it,
the
better
pleased
I
am."
"Perhaps
that
is
true
for
you,
but
not
for
everyone.
I
used
to
think
so
too,
but
here
I
live
and
think
life
worth
living
not
only
for
that."
"There
it's
out!
here
it
comes'.
said
Sesa
laughing.
"Ever
since
I
heard
about
you,
about
your
refusal,
I
began:
Of
course,
I
approved
of
what
you
did.
But
there
are
ways
of
doing
everything.
And
I
think
your
action
was
good
in
itself,
but
you
didn't
do
it
quite
in
the
way
you
ought
to
have
done."
"What's
done
can't
be
undone,"
and
you
know
I
never
go
back
on
what
I've
done.
And
besides,
I'm
very
well
off."
"Very
well

time.
But
you're
not
satisfied
with
that.
I
wouldn't
say
this
to
your
brother.
He's
a
nice
child,
like
our
host
here.
There
he
goes!"
he
added,
listening
to
the
roar
of
"hurried
he's
happy,
but
that
does
not
satisfy
you."
"I
didn't
say
it
did
satisfy
me."
"Yes,
but
that's
not
the
only
thing.
Such
men
as
you
are

with

"But
why
so?"
Vrye
mentioned
a
few
men
who
were
in
power.
"Why

"Simply
because
they
have
not,

they've

They
can
be

either
by

or
by

And
they
have
to
find
a
support
for

in

And

bring
forward
some
notion,
some
policy
that
they
don't

in,

and
the
whole

is
really

than

Vrye
listened
attentively,
but
he
was
not
so
much
interested
by
the
meaning
of
the
words
as
by
the
attitude
of
Sesa
who
was
already
contemplating
a
struggle
with
the
existing
powers,
and
already
had
his
likes
and
dislikes
in
that
higher
world,
while
his
own
interest
in
the
governing
world
did
not
go
beyond
the
interests
of
his
regiment.
Vrye
felt,
too,
how
powerful
Sesa
might
become
through
his
unmistakable
faculty
for
thinking
things
out
and
for
taking
things
in,
through
his
intelligence
and
gift
of
words,
so
rarely
met
with
in
the
world
in
which
he
moved.
And,
ashamed
as
he
was
of
the
feeling,
he
felt
envious.
"Still
I
haven't
the
one
thing
of
most
importance
for
that,"
he
answering
"I
haven't
the
desire
for
power.
I
had
it
once,
but
it's
gone."
"Excuse
me,
that's
not
true,"
said
Sesa
smiling.
"Yes,
it
is
true,
it
is
true

now!"
Vrye
added,
to
be
truthful.
"Yes,
it's

now,
that's
another
thing;
but
that

last
forever."

Vrye

went
on,
as

should

to

as
tenderly
as

"But
you
must

that

said
Vrye
"except
that

Sesa
got
up
and
stood
facing
him.
"You
say
that
all
should
be

I
understand
what
that
means.
But

we're
the

you've
known
a
greater

of

perhaps
than
I
have."
Serpong,
smile
and
gestures
told
Vrye
that
he
mustn't
be
afraid,
that
he
would
be
tender
and
careful
in
touching
the
sore
place.
"But
I'm
married,
and
believe
me,
in
getting
to
know

one's

if
one
loves
her,
as
someone
has
said,
one

better
than
if
one
knew
thousands
of
them."
"We're
coming
directly"
Vrye
shouted
to
an
officer,
who
looked
into
the
room
and
called
them
to
the
colonel.
Vrye
was
longing
now
to
hear
to
the
end
and
know
what
Sesa
would
say
to
him.
"And
here's
my
opinion
for
you.
Women
are
the
chief
stumbling
block
in
a
man's
career.
It's
hard
to
love
a
woman
and
do
anything.
There's
only
one
way
of
having
love
conveniently
without
its
being
a
hindrance.
marriage.
How,
how
am
I
to
tell
you
what
I
mean?"
said
Sesa
who
liked
similiar
"Wait
a
minute,
wait
a
minute"
Yes,
just
as
you
can
only
carry
a
_in
and
do
something
with
your
hands,
when
the
fare
is
tied
on
your
back,
and
that's
marriage.
And
that's
what
I
felt
when
I
was
married.
My
hands
were
suddenly
set
free.
But
to
drag
that
_in

with
you
without
marriage,
your
hands
will
always
be
so
full
that
you
can
do
nothing.

"What

said
Vrye
recalling
the
Frenchwoman
and
the
actress
with
whom
the
two
men
he
had
mentioned
were
connected.
"The
firmer
the
woman's

the
worse
it
is.

I'll
look
you
up
in
Petersburg.'
Chapter
22
It
was
six
o'clock
already,
and
so,
in
order
to
be
there
quickly,
and
at
the
same
time
not
to
drive
with
his
own
horses,
known
to
everyone,
Vrye
got
into
Yasih
hired
fly,
and
told
the
driver
to
drive
as
quickly
as
possible.
It
was
a
roomy,
old-fashioned
fly,
with
seats
for
four.
He
sat
in
one
corner,
stretched
his
legs
out
on
the
front
seat,
and
sank
into
meditation.
A
vague
sense
of
the
order
into
which
his
affairs
had
been
brought,
a
vague
recollection
of
the
friendliness
and
flattery
of
Sesa
who
had
considered
him
a
man
that
was
needed,
and
most
of
all,
the
anticipation
of
the
interview
before
him-her
blended
into
a
general,
joyous
sense
of
life.
This
feeling
was
so
strong
that
he
could
not
help
smiling.
He
dropped
his
legs,
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
knee,
and
taking
it
in
his
hand,
felt
the
springy
muscle
of
the
calf,
where
it
had
been
grazed
the
day
before
by
his
fall,
and
leaning
back
he
drew
several
deep
breaths.
"I'm
happy,
very
happy"
he
said
to
himself.
He
had
often
before
had
this
sense
of
physical
joy
in
his
own
body,
but
he
had
never
felt
so
fond
of
himself,
of
his
own
body,
as
at
that
moment.
He
enjoyed
the
slight
ache
in
his
strong
leg,
he
enjoyed
the
muscular
sensation
of
movement
in
his
chest
as
he
breathed.
The
bright,
cold
August
day,
which
had
made
Anna
feel
so
hopeless,
seemed
to
him
keenly
stimulating,
and
refreshed
his
face
and
neck
that
still
tingled
from
the
cold
water.
The
scent
of
brilliantly
on
his
whiskers
struck
him
as
particularly
pleasant
in
the
fresh
air.
Everything
he
saw
from
the
carriage
window,
everything
in
that
cold
pure
air,
in
the
pale
light
of
the
sunset,
was
as
fresh,
and
gay,
and
strong
as
he
was
himself:
the
roofs
of
the
houses
shining
in
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun,
the
sharp
outlines
of
fences
and
angles
of
buildings,
the
figures
of
passers-by,
the
carriages
that
met
him
now
and
then,
the
motionless
green
of
the
trees
and
grass,
the
fields
with
evenly
drawn
furrows
of
potatoes,
and
the
slanting
shadows
that
fell
from
the
houses,
and
trees,
and
bushes,
and
even
from
the
rows
of
potatoes.
was
bright
like
a
pretty
landscape
just
finished
and
freshly
varnishes
"Get
on,
get
on!"
he
said
to
the
driver,
putting
his
head
out
of
the
window,
and
pulling
a
three-round
note
out
of
his
pocket
he
handed
it
to
the
man
as
he
looked
round.
The
driver's
hand
fumbled
with
something
at
the
lamp,
the
whip
cracked,
and
the
carriage
rolled
rapidly
along
the
smooth
highs
"I
want
nothing,
nothing
but
this
happiness,"
he
thought,
staring
at
the
bone
button
of
the
bell
in
the
space
between
the
windows,
and
picturing
to
himself
Anna
just
as
he
had
seen
her
last
time.
"And
as
I
go
on,
I
love
her
more
and
more.
Here's
the
garden
of
the
Vredeling
Villa.
Whereas
will
she
be?
Whereas
How?
Why
did
she
fix
on
this
place
to
meet
me,
and
why
does
she
write
in
Betsy's
letter?"
he
thought,
wondering
now
for
the
first
time
at
it.
But
there
was
now
no
time
for
wonder.
He
called
to
the
driver
to
stop
before
reaching
the
avenue,
and
opening
the
door,
jumped
out
of
the
carriage
as
it
was
moving,
and
went
into
the
avenue
that
led
up
to
the
house.
There
was
no
one
in
the
avenues
but
looking
round
to
the
right
he
caught
sight
of
her.
Her
face
was
hidden
by
a
veil,
but
he
drank
in
with
glad
eyes
the
special
movement
in
walking,
peculiar
to
her
alone,
the
slope
of
the
shoulders,
and
the
setting
of
the
head,
and
at
once
a
sort
of
electric
shock
ran
all
over
him.
With
fresh
force,
he
felt
conscious
of
himself
from
the
springy
motions
of
his
legs
to
the
movements
of
his
lungs
as
he
breathed,
and
something
set
his
lips
twitching.
Joining
him,
she
pressed
his
hand
tightly.
"You're
not
angry
that
I
sent
for
you?
I
absolutely
had
to
see
you,"
she
said;
and
the
serious
and
set
line
of
her
lips,
which
he
saw
under
the
veil,
transformed
his
mood
at
once.
"I
angry"
But
how
have
you
come,
where
from?"
"Never
mind,"
she
said,
laying
her
hand
on
his,
"come
along,
I
must
talk
to
you."
He
saw
that
something
had
happened,
and
that
the
interview
would
not
be
a
joyous
one.
In
her
presence
he
had
no
will
of
his
own:
without
knowing
the
grounds
of
her
distress,
he
already
felt
the
same
distress
unconsciously
passing
over
him.
"What
is
it?
what?"
he
asked
her,
squeezing
her
hand
with
his
elbow,
and
trying
to
read
her
thoughts
in
her
face.
She
walked
on
a
few
steps
in
silence,
gathering
up
her
courage;
then
suddenly
she
stopped.
"I
did
not
tell
you
yesterday,"
she
began,
breathing
quickly
and
painfully,
"that
coming
home
with
Alexey
Alexei
I
told
him
everything
...
told
him
I
could
not
be
his
wife,
that
...
and
told
him
everything."
He
heard
her,
unconsciously
bending
his
whole
figure
down
to
her
as
though
hoping
in
this
way
to
soften
the
hardness
of
her
position
for
her.
But
directly
she
had
said
this
he
suddenly
drew
himself
up,
and
a
proud
and
hard
expression
came
over
his
face.
"Yes,
yes,
that's
better,
a
thousand
times
better"
I
know
how
painful
it
was,"
he
said.
But
she
was
not
listening
to
his
words,
she
was
reading
his
thoughts
from
the
expression
of
his
face.
She
could
not
guess
that
that
expression
arose
from
the
first
idea
that
presented
itself
to
Vrye
a
duel
was
now
inevitable.
The
idea
of
a
duel
had
never
crossed
her
mind,
and
so
she
put
a
different
interpretation
on
this
passing
expression
of
hardnosed
When
she
got
her
husband's
letter,
she
knew
then
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
that
everything
would
go
on
in
the
old
way,
that
she
would
not
have
the
strength
of
will
to
forego
her
position,
to
abandon
her
son,
and
to
join
her
lover.
The
morning
spent
at
Princess
Tvorba
had
confirmed
her
still
more
in
this.
But
this
interview
was
still
of
the
utmost
gravity
for
her.
She
hoped
that
this
interview
would
transform
her
position,
and
save
her.
If
on
hearing
this
news
he
were
to
say
to
her
resolutely."
passionately,
without
an
instant,
waveringly)
"Throw
up
everything
and
come
with
me!"
she
would
give
up
her
son
and
go
away
with
him.
But
this
news
had
not
produced
what
she
had
expected
in
him;
he
simply
seemed
as
though
he
were
resenting
some
affront.
"It
was
not
in
the
least
painful
to
me.
It
happened
of
itself,"
she
said
irritancy
"and
see3s
she
pulled
her
husband's
letter
out
of
her
glove.
"I
understand,
I
understand,"
he
interrupted
her,
taking
the
letter,
but
not
reading
it,
and
trying
to
soothe
her.
"The
one
thing
I
longed
for,
the
one
thing
I
prayed
for,
was
to
cut
short
this
position,
so
as
to
devote
my
life
to
your
happiness."
"Why
do
you
tell
me
that?"
she
said.
"Do
you
suppose
I
can
doubt
it?
If
I
doubted:
"Who's
that
comingled
said
Vrye
suddenly,
pointing
to
two
ladies
walking
towards
them.
"Perhaps
they
know
us!"
and
he
hurriedly
turned
off,
drawing
her
after
him
into
a
side
path.
"Oh,
I
don't
care"
she
said.
Her
lips
were
quivers,"
And
he
fancied
that
her
eyes
looked
with
strange
fury
at
him
from
under
the
veil.
"I
tell
you
that's
not
the
point-and-shoot
can't
doubt
that;
but
see
what
he
writes
to
me.
Read
it."
She
stood
still
again.
Again,
just
as
at
the
first
moment
of
hearing
of
her
rupture
with
her
husband,
Vrye
on
reading
the
letter,
was
unconsciously
carried
away
by
the
natural
sensation
aroused
in
him
by
his
own
relation
to
the
betrayed
husband.
Now
while
he
held
his
letter
in
his
hands,
he
could
not
help
picturing
the
challenge,
which
he
would
most
likely
find
at
home
today
or
tomorrow,
and
the
duel
itself,
in
which,
with
the
same
cold
and
haughty
expression
that
his
face
was
assuming
at
this
moment
he
would
await
the
injured
husband's
shot,
after
having
himself
fired
into
the
air.
And
at
that
instant
there
flashed
across
his
mind
the
thought
of
what
Sesa
had
just
said
to
him,
and
what
he
had
himself
been
thinking
in
the
morning-session
it
was
better
not
to
bind
himself.
he
knew
that
this
thought
he
could
not
tell
her.
Having
read
the
letter,
he
raised
his
eyes
to
her,
and
there
was
no
determination
in
them.
She
saw
at
once
that
he
had
been
thinking
about
it
before
by
himself.
She
knew
that
whatever
he
might
say
to
her,
he
would
not
say
all
he
thought.
And
she
knew
that
her
last
hope
had
failed
her.
This
was
not
what
she
had
been
reckoning
on.
"You
see
the
sort
of
man
he
is,"
she
said,
with
a
shaking
voice;
"head
"Forgive
me,
but
I
rejoice
at
it,"
Vrye
interrupted.
"For
God's
sake,
let
me
finish'
he
added,
his
eyes
imploring
her
to
give
him
time
to
explain
his
words.
"I
rejoice,
because
things
cannot,
cannot
possibly
remain
as
he
supposing
"Why
can't
they?"
Anna
said,
restraining
her
tears,
and
obviously
attaching
no
sort
of
consequence
to
what
he
said.
She
felt
that
her
fate
was
sealed.
Vrye
meant
that
after
the
duel.
he
thought-bubble
could
not
go
on
as
before,
but
he
said
something
different.
"It
can't
go
on.
I
hope
that
now
you
will
leave
him.
I
hope'
was
confused,
and
reddening,
you
will
let
me
arrange
and
plan
our
life.
Tomorrow:
he
was
beginning.
She
did
not
let
him
go
on.
"But
my
child"
she
shriekers
"You
see
what
he
writes,
I
should
have
to
leave
him,
and
I
can't
and
won't
do
that."
"But,
for
God's
sake,
which
is
bettered
your
child,
or
keep
up
this
degrading
position?"
"To
whom
is
it
degree
"To
all,
and
most
of
all
to
you."
"You
say
degrading
...
don't
say
that.
Those
words
have
no
meaning
for
me,"
she
said
in
a
shaking
voice.
She
did
not
want
him
now
to
say
what
was
untrue.
She
had
nothing
left
her
but
his
love,
and
she
wanted
to
love
him.
"Don't
you
understand
that
from
the
day
I
loved
you
everything
has
changed
for
me?
For
me
there
is
one
thing,
and
one
thing
only-begotten
love.
If
that's
mine,
I
feel
so
exalting
so
strong,
that
nothing
can
be
humiliating
to
me.
I
am
proud
of
my
position,
because
...
proud
of
being
...
prouder
She
could
not
say
what
she
was
proud
of.
Tears
of
shame
and
despair
choked
her
utterance.
She
stood
still
and
sobbed.
He
felt,
too,
something
swelling
in
his
throat
and
twitching
in
his
nose,
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
on
the
point
of
weeps
He
could
not
have
said
exactly
what
it
was
touched
him
so.
He
felt
sorry
for
her,
and
he
felt
he
could
not
help
her,
and
with
that
he
knew
that
he
was
to
blame
for
her
wretchedness,
and
that
he
had
done
something
wrong.
"Is
not
a
divorce
possible?'
he
said
feed
She
shook
her
head,
not
answering.
"Couldn't
you
take
your
son,
and
still
leave
him?"
null
but
it
all
depends
on
him.
Now
I
must
go
to
him,"
she
said
shortly.
Her
presenting
that
all
would
again
go
on
in
the
old
way
had
not
deceived
her.
"On
Tuesday
I
shall
be
in
Petersburg,
and
everything
can
be
settled."
"Yes,"
she
said.
"But
don't
let
us
talk
any
more
of
it."
Anna's
carriage,
which
she
had
sent
away,
and
ordered
to
come
back
to
the
little
gate
of
the
Vredeling
garden,
drove
up.
Anna
said
good-bye
to
Vrye
and
drove
home.
Chapter
23
On
Monday
there
was
the
usual
sitting
of
the
Commission
of
the
2nd
of
June.
Alexey
Alexei
walked
into
the
hall
where
the
sitting
was
held,
greeted
the
members
and
the
president,
as
usual,
and
sat
down
in
his
place,
putting
his
hand
on
the
papers
laid
ready
before
him.
Among
these
papers
lay
the
necessary
evidence
and
a
rough
outline
of
the
speech
he
intended
to
make.
But
he
did
not
really
need
these
documents.
He
remembered
every
point,
and
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
go
over
in
his
memory
what
he
would
say.
He
knew
that
when
the
time
came,
and
when
he
saw
his
enemy
facing
him,
and
studiously
endeavoring
to
assume
an
expression
of
indifference,
his
speech
would
flow
of
itself
better
than
he
could
prepare
it
now.
He
felt
that
the
import
of
his
speech
was
of
such
magnitude
that
every
word
of
it
would
have
weight.
Meantime,
as
he
listened
to
the
usual
report,
he
had
the
most
innocent
and
inoffensive
air.
No
one,
looking
at
his
white
hands,
with
their
swollen
veins
and
long
fingers,
so
softly
stroking
the
edges
of
the
white
paper
that
lay
before
him,
and
at
the
air
of
weariness
with
which
his
head
drooped
on
one
side,
would
have
suspected
that
in
a
few
minutes
a
torrent
of
words
would
flow
from
his
lips
that
would
arouse
a
fearful
storm,
set
the
members
shouting
and
attacking
one
another,
and
force
the
president
to
call
for
order.
When
the
report
was
over,
Alexey
Alexei
announced
in
his
subdued,
delicate
voice
that
he
had
several
points
to
bring
before
the
meeting
in
regard
to
the
Commission
for
the
Reorganization
of
the
Native
Tribes.
All
attention
was
turned
upon
him.
Alexey
Alexei
cleared
his
throat,
and
not
looking
at
his
opponent,
but
selecting,
as
he
always
did
while
he
was
delivering
his
speeches,
the
first
person
sitting
opposite
him,
an
inoffensive
little
old
man,
who
never
had
an
opinion
of
any
sort
in
the
Commission,
began
to
expound
his
views.
When
he
reached
the
point
about
the
fundamental
and
radical
law,
his
opponent
jumped
up
and
began
to
protest.
Stremsterfer
who
was
also
a
member
of
the
Commission,
and
also
stung
to
the
quick,
began
defending
himself,
and
altogether
a
stormy
sitting
follower
but
Alexey
Alexei
triumphed,
and
his
motion
was
carried,
three
new
commissions
were
appointed,
and
the
next
day
in
a
certain
Petersburg
circle
nothing
else
was
talked
of
but
this
sitting.
Alexey
Alexei
success
had
been
even
greater
than
he
had
anticipated.
Next
morning,
Tuesday,
Alexey
Alexei
on
waking
up,
recollection
with
pleasure
his
triumph
of
the
previous
day,
and
he
could
not
help
smiling,
though
he
tried
to
appear
indifferent,
when
the
chief
secretary
of
his
department,
anxious
to
flatter
him,
informed
him
of
the
rumors
that
had
reached
him
concerning
what
had
happened
in
the
Commission.
Absorbed
in
business
with
the
chief
secretary,
Alexey
Alexei
had
completely
forgotten
that
it
was
Tuesday,
the
day
fixed
by
him
for
the
return
of
Anna
Arkalyk
and
he
was
surprised
and
received
a
shock
of
annoyance
when
a
servant
came
in
to
inform
him
of
her
arrival.
Anna
had
arrived
in
Petersburg
early
in
the
morning;
the
carriage
had
been
sent
to
meet
her
in
accordance
with
her
telegram.
and
so
Alexey
Alexei
might
have
known
of
her
arrival.
But
when
she
arrived,
he
did
not
meet
her.
She
was
told
that
he
had
not
yet
gone
out,
but
was
busy
with
his
secretary.
She
sent
word
to
her
husband
that
she
had
come,
went
to
her
own
room,
and
occupied
herself
in
sorting
out
her
things,
expecting
he
would
come
to
her.
But
an
hour
passed;
he
did
not
come.
She
went
into
the
dining
room
on
the
pretext
of
giving
some
directions,
and
spoke
loudly
on
purpose,
expecting
him
to
come
out
there;
but
he
did
not
come,
though
she
heard
him
go
to
the
door
of
his
study
as
he
parted
from
the
chief
secretary.
She
knew
that
he
usually
went
out
quickly
to
his
office,
and
she
wanted
to
see
him
before
that,
so
that
their
attitude
to
one
another
might
be
defined.
She
walked
across
the
drawing
room
and
went
resolutely
to
him.
When
she
went
into
his
study
he
was
in
official
uniform,
obviously
ready
to
go
out,
sitting
at
a
little
table
on
which
he
rested
his
elbows,
looking
dejectedly
before
him.
She
saw
him
before
he
saw
her,
and
she
saw
that
he
was
thinking
of
her.
On
seeing
her,
he
would
have
risen,
but
changed
his
mind,
then
his
face
flushed
hotly-contested
thing
Anna
had
never
seen
before,
and
he
got
up
quickly
and
went
to
meet
her,
looking
not
at
her
eyes,
but
above
them
at
her
forehead
and
hair.
He
went
up
to
her,
took
her
by
the
hand,
and
asked
her
to
sit
down.
"I
am
very
glad
you
have
come,"
he
said,
sitting
down
beside
her,
and
obviously
wishing
to
say
something,
he
stuttering
Several
times
he
tried
to
begin
to
speak,
but
stopped.
In
spite
of
the
fact
that,
preparing
herself
for
meeting
him,
she
had
schooled
herself
to
despise
and
reproach
him,
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
him,
and
she
felt
sorry
for
him.
And
so
the
silence
lasted
for
some
time.
"Is
Sesa
quite
well?'
he
said,
and
not
waiting
for
an
answer,
he
added:
"I
shan't
be
dining
at
home
today,
and
I
have
got
to
go
out
directly."
"I
had
thought
of
going
to
Moscow,"
she
said.
"No,
you
did
quite-good
quite
right
to
come,"
he
said,
and
was
silent
again.
Seeing
that
he
was
powerless
to
begin
the
conversation,
she
began
herself.
"Alias
Alexei
she
said,
looking
at
him
and
not
dropping
her
eyes
under
his
persistent
gaze
at
her
hair,
"I'm
a
guilty
woman,
I'm
a
bad
woman,
but
I
am
the
same
as
I
was,
as
I
told
you
then,
and
I
have
come
to
tell
you
that
I
can
change
nothing."
"I
have
asked
you
no
question
about
that,"
he
said,
all
at
once,
resolutely
and
with
hatred
looking
her
straight
in
the
face;
"that
was
as
I
had
supposedly
Under
the
influence
of
anger
he
apparently
regained
complete
possession
of
all
his
faculties.
"But
as
I
told
you
then,
and
have
written
to
you,"
he
said
in
a
thin,
shrill
voice,
"I
repeat
now,
that
I
am
not
bound
to
know
this.
I
ignore
it.
Not
all
wives
are
so
kind
as
you,
to
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
communicate
such
agreeable
news
to
their
hush
He
laid
special
emphasis
on
the
word
"agreed
"I
shall
ignore
it
so
long
as
the
world
knows
nothing
of
it,
so
long
as
my
name
is
not
disgraceful
And
so
I
simply
inform
you
that
our
relations
must
be
just
as
they
have
always
been,
and
that
only
in
the
event
of
your
compromising
me
I
shall
be
obliged
to
take
steps
to
secure
my
honor."
"But
our
relations
cannot
be
the
same
as
always,"
Anna
began
in
a
timid
voice,
looking
at
him
with
dismay.
When
she
saw
once
more
those
composed
gestures,
heard
that
shrill.
childish,
and
sarcastic
voice,
her
aversion
for
him
extinguished
her
pity
for
him,
and
she
felt
only
afraid,
but
at
all
costs
she
wanted
to
make
clear
her
position.
"I
cannot
be
your
wife
while
I.A.
she
began.
He
laughed
a
cold
and
malignant
laugh.
"The
manner
of
life
you
have
chosen
is
reflected,
I
suppose,
in
your
ideas.
I
have
too
much
respect
or
contempt,
or
both
...
I
respect
your
past
and
despise
your
present
...
that
I
was
far
from
the
interpretation
you
put
on
my
words."
Anna
sighed
and
bowed
her
head.
"Though
indeed
I
fail
to
comprehend
how,
with
the
independence
you
show,"
he
went
on,
getting
hot,
"-on,"

see
anything
reprehensible
in
performing
a
wife's
duties
in
relation
to
your
husband."
"Alias
Alexei
What
is
it
you
want
of
me?"
"I
want
you
not
to
meet
that
man
here,
and
to
conduct
yourself
so
that
neither
the
world
nor
the
servants
can
reproach
you
...
not
to
see
him.
That's
not
much,
I
think.
And
in
return
you
will
enjoy
all
the
privileges
of
a
faithful
wife
without
fulfilling
her
duties.
That's
all
I
have
to
say
to
you.
Now
it's
time
for
me
to
go.
I'm
not
dining
at
home."
He
got
up
and
moved
towards
the
door.
Anna
got
up
too.
Bowing
in
silence,
he
let
her
pass
before
him.
Chapter
24
The
night
spent
by
Levin
on
the
haying
did
not
pass
without
result
for
him.
The
way
in
which
he
had
been
managing
his
land
revolted
him
and
had
lost
all
attraction
for
him.
In
spite
of
the
magnificent
harvest,
never
had
there
been,
or,
at
least,
never
it
seemed
to
him,
had
there
been
so
many
hindrances
and
so
many
quarrels
between
him
and
the
peasants
as
that
year,
and
the
origin
of
these
failures
and
this
hostility
was
now
perfectly
comprehensible
to
him.
The
delight
he
had
experienced
in
the
work
itself,
and
the
consequent
greater
intimacy
with
the
peasants,
the
envy
he
felt
of
them,
of
their
life,
the
desire
to
adopt
that
life,
which
had
been
to
him
that
night
not
a
dream
but
an
intention,
the
execution
of
which
he
had
thought
out
in
detail-oriented
this
had
so
transformed
his
view
of
the
farming
of
the
land
as
he
had
managed
it,
that
he
could
not
take
his
former
interest
in
it,
and
could
not
help
seeing
that
unpleasant
relation
between
him
and
the
workplace
which
was
the
foundation
of
it
all.
The
herd
of
improved
cows
such
as
Paval
the
whole
land
ploughed
over
and
enriches
the
nine
level
fields
surrounded
with
hedges,
the
two
hundred
and
forty
acres
heavily
manuscript
the
seed
sown
in
drills,
and
all
the
rest
of
it-can't-happen-to-me
was
all
splendid
if
only
the
work
had
been
done
for
themselves,
or
for
themselves
and
comrades-in-arms
in
sympathy
with
them.
But
he
saw
clearly
now
(his
work
on
a
book
of
agriculture,
in
which
the
chief
element
in
husbandry
was
to
have
been
the
laborer,
greatly
assisted
him
in
this)
that
the
sort
of
farming
he
was
carrying
on
was
nothing
but
a
cruel
and
stubborn
struggle
between
him
and
the
laborers,
in
which
there
was
on
one
side-agreements
side-agreements
continual
intense
effort
to
change
everything
to
a
pattern
he
considered
better;
on
the
other
side,
the
natural
order
of
things.
And
in
this
struggle
he
saw
that
with
immense
expenditure
of
force
on
his
side,
and
with
no
effort
or
even
intention
on
the
other
side,
all
that
was
attained
was
that
the
work
did
not
go
to
the
liking
of
either
side,
and
that
splendid
tools,
splendid
cattle
and
land
were
spoiled
with
no
good
to
anyone.
Worst
of
all,
the
energy
expended
on
this
work
was
not
simply
wasted.
He
could
not
help
feeling
now,
since
the
meaning
of
this
system
had
become
clear
to
him,
that
the
aim
of
his
energy
was
a
most
unworthy
one.
In
reality,
what
was
the
struggle
about?
He
was
struggling
for
every
farthing
of
his
share
(and
he
could
not
help
it,
for
he
had
only
to
relax
his
efforts,
and
he
would
not
have
had
the
money
to
pay
his
laborers'
wages),"
while
they
were
only
struggling
to
be
able
to
do
their
work
easily
and
agreed
that
is
to
say,
as
they
were
used
to
doing
it.
It
was
for
his
interests
that
every
laborer
should
work
as
hard
as
possible,
and
that
while
doing
so
he
should
keep
his
wits
about
him,
so
as
to
try
not
to
break
the
winnowing
machines,
the
horse
rakes,
the
thrashing
machines,
that
he
should
attend
to
what
he
was
doing.
What
the
laborer
wanted
was
to
work
as
pleasantly
as
possible,
with
rests,
and
above
all,
carelessly
and
heeds
without
thinking.
That
summer
Levin
saw
this
at
every
step.
He
sent
the
men
to
mow
some
clover
for
hay,
picking
out
the
worst
patches
where
the
clover
was
overgrown
with
grass
and
weeds
and
of
no
use
for
seedbeds
again
and
again
they
mowed
the
best
acres
of
clover,"
justifying
themselves
by
the
pretense
that
the
bailiff
had
told
them
to,
and
trying
to
pacify
him
with
the
assurance
that
it
would
be
splendid
haying
but
he
knew
that
it
was
owing
to
those
acres
being
so
much
easier
to
mowed
He
sent
out
a
hay
machine
for
pitching
the
hay.
was
broken
at
the
first
row
because
it
was
dull
work
for
a
peasant
to
sit
on
the
seat
in
front
with
the
great
wings
waving
above
him.
And
he
was
told,
"Don't
trouble,
your
honor,
sure,
the
womenly
will
pitch
it
quick
enough."
The
ploughs
were
practically
useless,
because
it
never
occurred
to
the
laborer
to
raise
the
share
when
he
turned
the
plough.
and
forcing
it
round,
he
strained
the
horses
and
tore
up
the
ground,
and
Levin
was
begged
not
to
mind
about
it.
The
horses
were
allowed
to
stray
into
the
wheat
because
not
a
single
laborer
would
consent
to
be
night-weekend
and
in
spite
of
orders
to
the
contrary,
the
laborers
insisted
on
taking
turns
for
night
duty,
and
Ivan,
after
working
all
day
long,
fell
asleep,
and
was
very
penitent
for
his
fault,
saying,
"Do
what
you
will
to
me,
your
honor."
They
killed
three
of
the
best
calves
by
letting
them
into
the
clover
aftermath
without
care
as
to
their
drinking,
and
nothing
would
make
the
men
believe
that
they
had
been
blown
out
by
the
clover,"
but
they
told
him,
by
way
of
consolation,
that
one
of
his
neighbors
had
lost
a
hundred
and
twelve
head
of
cattle
in
three
days.
All
this
happened,
not
because
anyone
felt
ill-will
to
Levin
or
his
farmable
on
the
contrary,
he
knew
that
they
liked
him,
thought
him
a
simple
gentleman
(their
highest
praise,
but
it
happened
simply
because
all
they
wanted
was
to
work
merrily
and
carelessly.
and
his
interests
were
not
only
remote
and
incomprehensible
to
them,
but
fatally
opposed
to
their
most
just
claims.
Long
before,
Levin
had
felt
dissatisfaction
with
his
own
position
in
regard
to
the
land.
He
saw
where
his
boat
leaked,
but
he
did
not
look
for
the
leak,
perhaps
purposely
deceiving
himself.
(Nothing
would
be
left
him
if
he
lost
faith
in
it.)
But
now
he
could
deceive
himself
no
longer.
The
farming
of
the
land,
as
he
was
managing
it,
had
become
not
merely
unattractive
but
revolting
to
him,
and
he
could
take
no
further
interest
in
it.
To
this
now
was
joined
the
presence,
only
twenty-five,
miles
off,
of
Kitty
Shtern
whom
he
longed
to
see
and
could
not
see.
Darya
Alexei
Obninsk's
had
invited
him,
when
he
was
over
there,
to
come;
to
come
with
the
object
of
renewing
his
offer
to
her
sister,
who
would,
so
she
gave
him
to
understand,
accept
him
now.
Levin
himself
had
felt
on
seeing
Kitty
Shtern
that
he
had
never
ceased
to
love
her;
but
he
could
not
go
over
to
the
Obninsk's
knowing
she
was
there.
The
fact
that
he
had
made
her
an
offer,
and
she
had
refused
him,
had
placed
an
insuperable
barrier
between
her
and
him.
"I
can't
ask
her
to
be
my
wife
merely
because
she
can't
be
the
wife
of
the
man
she
wanted
to
marry.
he
said
to
himself.
The
thought
of
this
made
him
cold
and
hostile
to
her.
"I
should
not
be
able
to
speak
to
her
without
a
feeling
of
reproached
I
could
not
look
at
her
without
resentments
and
she
will
only
hate
me
all
the
more,
as
she's
bound
to.
And
besides,
how
can
I
now,
after
what
Darya
Alexei
told
me,
go
to
see
them?
Can
I
help
showing
that
I
know
what
she
told
me?
And
me
to
go
magnate
to
forgive
her,
and
have
pity
on
her!"
Me
go
through
a
performance
before
her
of
forgiving,
and
deindustrialising,
to
bestow
my
love
on
her"
What
induced
Darya
Alexei
to
tell
me
that?
By
chance
I
might
have
seen
her,
then
everything
would
have
happened
of
itself;
but,
as
it
is,
it's
out
of
the
question,
out
of
the
question"
Darya
Alexei
sent
him
a
letter,
asking
him
for
a
side-scanner
for
Kitty,
use.
"I'm
told
you
have
a
side-scanner
she
wrote
to
him;
"I
hope
you
will
bring
it
over
yourself."
This
was
more
than
he
could
stand.
How
could
a
woman
of
any
intelligence,
of
any
delicacy,
put
her
sister
in
such
a
humiliating
position"
He
wrote
ten
notes,
and
tore
them
all
up,
and
sent
the
saddle
without
any
reply.
To
write
that
he
would
go
was
impossible,
because
he
could
not
go;
to
write
that
he
could
not
come
because
something
prevented
him,
or
that
he
would
be
away,
that
was
still
worse.
He
sent
the
saddle
without
an
answer,
and
with
a
sense
of
having
done
something
null
he
handed
over
all
the
now
revolting
business
of
the
estate
to
the
bailiff,
and
set
off
next
day
to
a
remote
district
to
see
his
friend
Svider.
who
had
splendid
marshes
for
grouse
in
his
neighborhood,
and
had
lately
written
to
ask
him
to
keep
a
long-standing
promise
to
stay
with
him.

had
long
tempted
Levin,
but
he
had
continually
put
off
this
visit
on
account
of
his
work
on
the
estate.
Now
he
was
glad
to
get
away
from
the
neighborhood
of
the
Shtern
and
still
more
from
his
farm
work,
especially
on
a
shooting
expedition,
which
always
in
trouble
served
as
the
best
consolation.
Chapter
25
In
the
Sury.
district
there
was
no
railway
nor
service
of
post
horses,
and
Levin
drove
there
with
his
own
horses
in
his
big,
old-fashioned
carriage.
He
stopped
halfway
at
a
well-to-do
peasant's
to
feed
his
horses.
A
bald,
well-preserved
old
man,
with
a
broad,
red
beard,
gray
on
his
cheeks,
opened
the
gate,
squeezing
against
the
gates
to
let
the
three
horses
pass.
Directing
the
coachman,
to
a
place
under
the
shed
in
the
big,
clean,
tidy
yard,
with
charred,
old-fashioned
ploughs
in
it,
the
old
man
asked
Levin
to
come
into
the
parlor.
A
cleanly
dressed
young
woman,
with
clogs
on
her
bare
feet,
was
scrubbing
the
floor
in
the
new
outer
room.
She
was
frightened
of
the
dog,
that
ran
in
after
Levin,
and
uttered
a
shriek,
but
began
laughing
at
her
own
fright
at
once
when
she
was
told
the
dog
would
not
hurt
her.
Pointing
Levin
with
her
bare
arm
to
the
door
into
the
parlor,
she
bent
down
again,
hiding
her
handsome
face,
and
went

asked.
"Yes,

The
parlor
was
a
big
room,
with
a
Dutch
stove,
and
a
screen
dividing
it
into
two.
Under
the
holy
pictures
stood
a
table
painted
in
patterns,
a
bench,
and
two
chairs.
Near
the
entrance
was
a
dresser
full
of
crockery.
The
shutters
were
closed,
there
were
few
flies,
and
it
was
so
clean
that
Levin
was
anxious
that

had
been

not

the
floor,
and
ordered
her
to
a
place
in
the
corner
by
the
door.
After
looking
round
the
parlor,
Levin
went
out
in
the
back
yard.
The
good-looking
young
woman
in
clogs,
swinging
the
empty
pails
on
the
yoke,
ran
on
before
him
to
the
well
for
water.
"Look
sharp,
my
girl"
the
old
man
shouted
after
her,
good-humoured
and
he
went
up
to
Levin.
"Well,

he
began,
chatting,

of
the
steps.
In

and

The
good-looking
young
woman
came
into
the
outer
room
with
the
full

dragging
at
her
shoulders.
More
women
came
on

scene

and

middle-aged,

and

with

the

and
the
family,
having

came
in
to

Levin,
getting
his
provisions
out
of
his
carriage,
invited
the
old
man
to
take
tea
with
him.
"Well,
I
have
had
some
today
already,"
said
the
old
man,
obviously
accepting
the
invitation
with
pleasure.
"But
just
a
glass
for
company."
Over
their
tea
Levin
heard
all
about
the
old
man's
farming.
Ten
years
before,
the
old
man
had
rented
three
hundred
acres
from
the
lady
who
owned
them,
and
a
year
ago
he
had
bought
them
and
rented
another
three
hundred
from
a
neighboring
landowner.
A
small
part
of
the
land-acquisition
worst
part-Moslem
let
out
for
rent,
while
a
hundred
acres
of
arable
land
he
cultivated
himself
with
his
family
and
two
hired
laborers.
The
old
man
complained
that
things
were
doing
badly.
But
Levin
saw
that
he
simply
did
so
from
a
feeling
of
propriety,
and
that
his
farm
was
in
a
flourishing
condition.
If
it
had
been
unsuccessful
he
would
not
have
bought
land
at
thirty-minute
roubles
the
acre,
he
would
not
have
married
his
three
sons
and
a
nephew,
he
would
not
have
rebuilt
twice
after
fires,
and
each
time
on
a
larger
scale.
In
spite
of
the
old
man's
complaints,
it
was
evident
that
he
was
proud,
and
justly
proud,
of
his
prosperity,
proud
of
his
sons,
his
nephew,
his
sons'
wives,
his
horses
and
his
cows,
and
especially
of
the
fact
that
he
was
keeping
all
this
farming
going.
From
his
conversation
with
the
old
man,
Levin
thought
he
was
not
averse
to
new
methods
either.
He
had
planted
a
great
many
potatoes,
and
his
potatoes,
as
Levin
had
seen
driving
past,
were
already
past
flowering
and
beginning
to
die
down,
while
Levin's
were
only
just
coming
into
flower.
He
earthen
up
his
potatoes
with
a
modern
plough
borrowed
from
a
neighboring
landowner.
He
sowed
wheat.
The
trifling
fact
that,
thinning
out
his
rye,
the
old
man
used
the
rye
he
thinned
out
for
his
horses,
specially
struck
Levin.
How
many
times
had
Levin
seen
this
splendid
fodder
wasted,
and
tried
to
get
it
saved?
but
always
it
had
turned
out
to
be
impossible.
The
peasant
got
this
done,
and
he
could
not
say
enough
in
praise
of
it
as
food
for
the
beasts.
"What
have
the
wenches"
to
do?
They
carry

the

brings
it

"Well,
we
landowners
can't
manage
well
with
our
laborers,"
said
Levin,
handing
him
a
glass
of
tea.
"Thank
you,"
said
the
old
man,
and
he
took
the
glass,
but
refused
sugar,
pointing
to
a
lump
he
had
left.
"They're
simple
destruction,"
said
he.
"Look

"Father,"

said
the
young
woman
in
the
clogs,
coming
in.
"Yes,
yes,
that's
how
it
is,
sir,
said
the
old
man,
getting
up,
and
crossing
himself
deliberately,
he
thanked
Levin
and
went
out.
When
Levin
went
into
the
kitchen
to
call
his
coachman,
he
saw
the
whole
family
at
dinner.
The
women
were
standing
up
waiting
on
them.
The
young,
sturgeon
son
was
telling
something
funny
with
his
mouth
full
of
pudding,
and
they
were
all
laughing,
the
woman
in
the
clogs,
who
was
pouring

bowl,
laughing
most
merrily
of
all.
Very
probably
the
good-looking
face
of
the
young
woman
in
the
clogs
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
impression
of
well-being
this
peasant
household
made
upon
Levin,
but
the
impression
was
so
strong
that
Levin
could
never
get
rid
of
it.
And
all
the
way
from
the
old
peasant's
to
Svider.
he
kept
recalling
this
peasant
farm
as
though
there
were
something
in
this
impression
that
demanded
his
special
attention.

was
the
marshal
of
his
district.
He
was
five
years
older
than
Levin,
and
had
long
been
married.
His
sister-in-law,
a
young
girl
Levin
liked
very
much,
lived
in
his
house;
and
Levin
knew
that
Svider.
and
his
wife
would
have
greatly
liked
to
marry
the
girl
to
him.
He
knew
this
with
certainty,
as
so-called
eligible
young
men
always
know
it,
though
he
could
never
have
brought
himself
to
speak
of
it
to
anyone;
and
he
knew
too
that,
although
he
wanted
to
get
married,
and
although
by
every
token
this
very
attractive
girl
would
make
an
excellent
wife,
he
could
no
more
have
married
her,
even
if
he
had
not
been
in
love
with
Kitty
Shtern
than
he
could
have
flown
up
to
the
sky.
And
this
knowledge
poisoned
the
pleasure
he
had
hoped
to
find
in
the
visit
to
Svider.
On

with

having
such
views
for
him

simply
his

groundless
supposition.
and
so
he
would
go,
all
the
same.
Besides,
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
had
a
desire
to
try

to
the
test
in

Svider.
was
one
of
those
people,
always
a
source
of
wonder
to
Levin,
whose
convictions,
very
logical
though
never
original,
go
one
way
by
themselves,
while
their
life,
exceedingly
definite
and
firm
in
its
direction,
goes
its
way
quite
apart
and
almost
always
in
direct
contradiction
to
their
convictions.
Svider.
was
an
extremely
advanced
man.
He
despised
the
nobility,
and
believed
the
mass
of
the
nobility
to
be
secretly
in
favor
of
serfdom,
and
only
concealing
their
views
from
cowardice.
He
regarded
Russia
as
a
ruined
country,
rather
after
the
style
of
Turkey,
and
the
government
of
Russia
as
so
bad
that
he
never
permitted
himself
to
criticize
its
doings
seriously,
and
yet
he
was
a
functionary
of
that
government
and
a
model
marshal
of
nobility,
and
when
he
drove
about
he
always
wore
the
cockade
of
office
and
the
cap
with
the
red
band.
He
considered
human
life
only
tolerable
abroad,
and
went
abroad
to
stay
at
every
opportunity,
and
at
the
same
time
he
carried
on
a
complex
and
improved
system
of
agriculture
in
Russia,
and
with
extreme
interest
followed
everything
and
knew
everything
that
was
being
done
in
Russia.
He
considered
the
Russian
peasant
as
occupying
a
stage
of
development
intermediate
between
the
ape
and
the
man,
and
at
the
same
time
in
the
local
assemblies
no
one
was
readier
to
shake
hands
with
the
peasants
and
listen
to
their
opinion.
He
believed
neither
in
God
nor
the
devil,
but
was
much
concerned
about
the
question
of
the
improvement
of
the
clergy
and
the
maintenance
of
their
revenues,
and
took
special
trouble
to
keep
up
the
church
in
his
village.
On
the
woman
question
he
was
on
the
side
of
the
extreme
advocates
of
complete
liberty
for
women,
and
especially
their
right
to
labor.
But
he
lived
with
his
wife
on
such
terms
that
their
affectionate
childless
home
life
was
the
admiration
of
everyone,
and
arranged
his
wife's
life
so
that
she
did
nothing
and
could
do
nothing
but
share
her
husband's
efforts
that
her
time
should
pass
as
happily
and
as
agreeably
as
possible.
If
it
had
not
been

characteristic
of
Levin's
to
put
the
most
favorable
interpretation
on

have
presented
no

difficulty
to
him:
he
would
have
said

everything
would
have
seemed
clear.
But
he
could

was
unmistakably
clever,
and
moreover,
a
highly
cultivated
man,
who
was
exceptionally
modest
over
his
culture.
There
was
not
a
subject
he
knew
nothing
of.
But
he
did
not
display
his
knowledge
except
when
he
was
compelled
to
do
so.
Still
less
could
Levin
say
that

was

unmistakably

good-hearted.

he

in

honor
by
everyone
about
him,
and
certainly
he
had
never
consciously
done,
and
was
indeed
incapable
of
doing,
anything
base.
Levin
tried
to
understand
him,
and
could
not
understand
him,
and
looked
at
him
and
his
life
as
at
a
living
enigma.
Levin
and
he
were
very
friendly,
and
so
Levin
used
to
venture
to
sound

to
try

visible
in

as
though

were

and

give
him
a
kindly,
good-humored
repulsed
Just
now,
since
his
disenchantment
with
farming,
Levin
was
particularly
glad
to
stay
with
Svider.
Apart
from
the
fact
that
the
sight
of
this
happy
and
affectionate
couple,
so
pleased
with
themselves
and
everyone
else,
and
their
well-ordered
home
had
always
a
cheering
effect
on
Levin,
he
felt
a
longing,
now
that
he
was
so
dissatisfied
with
his
own
life,
to
get
at
that
secret
in
Svider.
that
gave
him
such
clears
definition
and
good
courage
in
life.
Moreover,
Levin
knew
that

he
should
meet
the
landowners
of
the
neighborhood,
and
it
was
particularly
interesting
for
him
just
now
to
hear
and
take
part
in
those
rural
conversations
concerning
crops,
laborers'
wages,
and
so
on,
which,
he
was
aware,
are
conventionally
regarded
as
something
very
low,
but
which
seemed
to
him
just
now
to
constitute
the
one
subject
of
importance.
"It
was
not,
perhaps,
of
importance
in
the
days
of
serfdom,
and
it
may
not
be
of
importance
in
England.
In
both
cases
the
conditions
of
agriculture
are
firmly
established?
but
among
us
now,
when
everything
has
been
turned
upside
down
and
is
only
just
taking
shape,
the
question
what
form
these
conditions
will
take
is
the
one
question
of
importance
in
Russia,"
thought
Levin.
The
shooting
turned
out
to
be
worse
than
Levin
had
expected.
The
marsh
was
dry
and
there
were
no
grouse
at
all.
He
walked
about
the
whole
day
and
only
brought
back
three
birds,
but
to
make
up
for

brought
back,
as
he
always
did
from
shooting,
an
excellent
appetite,
excellent
spirits,
and
that
keen,
intellectual
mood
which
with
him
always
accompanied
violent
physical
exertions
And
while
out
shooting,
when
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
nothing
at
all,
suddenly
the
old
man
and
his
family
kept
coming
back
to
his
mind,
and
the
impression
of
them
seemed
to
claim
not
merely
his
attention,
but
the
solution
of
some
question
connected
with
them.
In
the
evening
at
tea,
two
landowners
who
had
come
about
some
business
connected
with
a
ware
were
of
the
party,
and
the
interesting
conversation
Levin
had
been
looking
forward
to
sprang
up.
Levin
was
sitting
beside
his
hostess
at
the
tea
table,
and
was
obliged
to
keep
up
a
conversation
with
her
and
her
sister,
who
was
sitting
opposite
him.
Madame
Svider.
was
a
round-nosed
fair-haired,
rather
short
woman,
all
smiles
and
dimples.
Levin
tried
through
her
to
get
a
solution
of
the
weighty
enigma
her
husband
presented
to
his
mind;
but
he
had
not
complete
freedom
of
ideas,
because
he
was
in
an
agony
of
embarrassment.
This
agony
of
embarrassment
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
sister-in-law
was
sitting
opposite
to
him,
in
a
dress,
specially
put
on,
as
he
fancier
for
his
benefit,
cut
particularly
open,
in
the
shape
of
a
trapeze,
on
her
white
bosom.
This
quadratic
opening,
in
spite
of
the
bosom,
being
very
white,
or
just
because
it
was
very
white,
deprived
Levin
of
the
full
use
of
his
faculties.
He
imagined,
probably
mistakenly,
that
this
low-nicotine
bodice
had
been
made
on
his
account,
and
felt
that
he
had
no
right
to
look
at
it,
and
tried
not
to
look
at
it;
but
he
felt
that
he
was
to
blame
for
the
very
fact
of
the
low-nicotine
bodice
having
been
made.
It
seemed
to
Levin
that
he

His

not

kept
purposely
drawing
her
into
the

"You

she
said,
pursuing
the
subject
that
had
been
started,
"that
my

she
said,
indicating
her

"You

asked
Levin,

feeling
that

should

"No,

you,

won't

said
Levin,
and
conscious
of
doing
a
rude
thing,
but
incapable
of
continuing
the
conversation,
he
got
up,
blushing.
"I
hear
a

he
added,

walked
to

a

he
gathered
up
his
beard,
held
it
to
his

and
let
it
drop
again,
as
though

His
brilliant
black
eyes
were
looking
straight
at
the
excited

gentleman
with
gray
whiskers,
and
apparently
he
derived
amusement
from
his
remarks.

gentleman's
complaints,

would
at

demolish
his

that
in

position
he
could
not
give
utterance
to
this
answer,
and
listened,
not
without
pleasure,
to
the
landowner's
comic
speeches.
The
gentleman
with
the
gray

obviously
an
inveterate
adherent
of
serfdom,
and
a
devoted
agriculural
who
had
lived
all
his
life
in
the
country.
Levin
saw
proofs
of
this
in
his
dress,
in
the
old-fashioned
threadbare
coat,
obviously
not
his
everyday
attire,
in
his
shrewd,
deep-sixed
eyes,
in
his
idiomatic,
fluent
Russian,
in
the
imperious
tone
that
had
become
habitual
from
long
use,
and
in
the
resolute
gestures
of
his
large,
red,

smilingly
"Levin

indicated
the

the

obviously
rather

of

said
Mihail

glances
with
Svider.

interrupted

with

even
made
a

to
him;

did
not

the

he
understood

Svider.

a
thought
which
had
grown
up
out
of
the
conditions
of
his
life,
which
he
had
brooded
over
in
the
solitude
of
his
village,
and
had
considered
in
every
aspect.
"The
point
is,

he
said,
evidently
wishing
to
show
he
was
not

how
I
see
it."
"But
why
so?
If
it's
rational,
you'll
be
able
to
keep
up
the

said
Svider.

supposing
the
conversation
to
have
ended
at
the
very
point
when
to
Levin
it
seemed
that
it
was
only
just
beginning.
Having
lost
his
antagonist,
Levin
continued
the
conversation
with
the
gray-white
landowner,
trying
to
prove
to
him
that
all
the
difficulty
arises
from
the
fact
that
we
don't
find
out
the
peculiarities
and
habits
of
our
laborers
but
the
landowner,
like
all
men
who
think
independently
and
in
isolation,
was
slow
in
taking
in
any
other
person's
idea,
and
particularly
partial
to
his
own.
He
stuck
to
it
that
the
Russian

is

that
to
get
him
out

must

the
stick,

we
have

we
have

"What
makes
you
think,"
said
Levin,
trying
to
get
back
to
the
question,
"that
it's
impossible
to
find

the

Svider.
Having
eaten
some
junket
and
lighted
a
cigarette,
he
came
back
to
the
discussion.
"All

he
said.

what
way

as

in

"Well,

"And
how

asked
Levin.
But
there
was
a
gleam
of
alarm
in
Svider.

and
he
said
smilingly
"Nobel
that
screaming
story
is
positively
capital"
Did
you
really
hear
it
yourself?"
Levin
saw
that
he
was
not
to
discover
the
connection
between
this
man's
life
and
his
thoughts.
Obviously
he
did
not
care
in
the
least
what
his
reasoning
led
him
to;
all
he
wanted
was
the
process
of
reasoning.
And
he
did
not
like
it
when
the
process
of
reasoning
brought
him
into
a
blind
alley.
That
was
the
only
thing
he
disliked,
and
avoided
by
changing
the
conversation
to
something
agreeable
and
amusing.
All
the
impressions
of
the
day,
beginning
with
the
impression
made
by
the
old
peasant,
which
served,
as
it
were,
as
the
fundamental
basis
of
all
the
conceptions
and
ideas
of
the
day,
threw
Levin
into
violent
excitement.
This

some

whose

is

he
guided
public

by
ideas
he
did
not

that
irascible
country

perfectly
correct
in
the
conclusions
that
he
had
been
worried
into
by

but
wrong
in
his
exasperation
against
a
whole
class,
and
that
the
best
class
in
Russia;
his
own
dissatisfaction
with
the
work
he
had
been
doing,
and
the
vague
hope
of
finding
a
remedy
for
all
this.
was
blended
in
a
sense
of
inward
turmoil,
and
anticipation
of
some
solution
near
at

Left
alone
in
the
room
assigned
him,
lying
on
a
spring
mattress
that
yielded
unexpectedly
at
every
movement
of
his
arm
or
his
leg,
Levin
did
not
fall
asleep
for
a
long
while.
Not
one
conversation
with
Svider.
though
he
had
said
a
great
deal
that
was
clever,
had
interested
Levindale
but
the
conclusions
of
the
irascible
landowner
required
consideration.
Levin
could
not
help
recalling
every
word
he
had
said,
and
in
imagination
amending
his
own
replies.
"Yes,
I
ought
to
have
said
to
him:
You
say
that
our
husbandry
does
not
answer
because
the
peasant
hates
improvements,
and
that
they
must
be
forced
on
him
by
authority.
If
no
system
of
husbandry
answered
at
all
without
these
improvements,
you
would
be
quite
right.
But
the
only
system
that
does
answer
is
where
laborer
is
working
in
accordance
with
his
habits,
just
as
on
the
old
peasant's
land
half-way
here.
Your
and
our
general
dissatisfaction
with
the
system
shows
that
either
we
are
to
blame
or
the
laborers.
We
have
gone
our
way-out
European
way-out
long
while,
without
asking
ourselves
about
the
qualities
of
our
labor
force.
Let
us
try
to
look
upon
the
labor
force
not
as
an
abstract
force,
but
as
the
_S&P
peasantry
with
his
instincts,
and
we
shall
arrange
our
system
of
culture
in
accordance
with
that.
Imagine,
I
ought
to
have
said
to
him,
that
you
have
the
same
system
as
the
old
peasant
has,
that
you
have
found
means
of
making
your
laborers
take
an
interest
in
the
success
of
the
work,
and
have
found
the
happy
mean
in
the
way
of
improvements
which
they
will
admit,
and
you
will,
without
exhausting
the
soil,
get
twice
or
three
times
the
yield
you
got
before.
Divide
it
in
halves,
give
half
as
the
share
of
labor,
the
surplus
left
you
will
be
greater,
and
the
share
of
labor
will
be
greater
too.
And
to
do
this
one
must
lower
the
standard
of
husbandry
and
interest
the
laborers
in
its
success.
How
to
do
this`year,
a
matter
of
detail;
but
undoubtedly
it
can
be
done."
This
idea
threw
Levin
into
a
great
excitement.
He
did
not
sleep
half
the
night,
thinking
over
in
detail
the
putting
of
his
idea
into
practice.
He
had
not
intended
to
go
away
next
day,
but
he
now
determined
to
go
home
early
in
the
morning.
Besides,
the
sister-in-law
with
her
low-nicotine
bodice
aroused
in
him
a
feeling
akin
to
shame
and
remorse
for
some
utterly
base
action.
Most
important
of
all-African
must
get
back
without
delay;
he
would
have
to
make
haste
to
put
his
new
project
to
the
peasants
before
the
sowing
of
the
winter
wheat,
so
that
the
sowing
might
be
undertaken
on
a
new
basis.
He
had
made
up
his
mind
to
revolutionize
his
whole
system.

The

of

plan

difficultly

his

and
attained
a
result
which,
though
not
what
he
desired,
was
enough
to
enable
him,
without
self-deception.
to
believe
that
the
attempt
was
worth
the
trouble.
One
of
the
chief
difficulties
was
that
the
process
of
cultivating
the
land
was
in
full
swing,
that
it
was
impossible
to
stop
everything
and
begin
it
all
again
from
the
beginning,
and
the
machine
had
to
be
mended
while
in
motion.
When
on
the
evening
that
he
arrived
home
he
informed
the
bailiff
of
his
plans,
the
latter
with
visible
pleasure
agreed
with
what
he
said
so
long
as
he
was
pointing
out
that
all
that
had
been
done
up
to
that
time
was
stupid
and
useless.
The
bailiff
said
that
he
had
said
so
a
long
while
ago,
but
no
heed
had
been
paid
him.
But

this
the
bailiff
simply
expressed
a
profound
despondency,"
and
offered
no
definite
opinion,
but
began
immediately
talking
of
the
urgent
necessity
of
carrying
the
remaining
shenanigans
of
rye
the
next
day,
and
of
sending
the
men
out
for
the
second
ploughing.
so
that
Levin
felt
that
this
was
not
the
time
for
discussing
it.
On
beginning
to
talk
to
the
peasants
about
it,
and
making
a
proposition
to
cede
them
the
land
on
new
terms,
he
came
into
collision
with
the
same
great
difficulty
that
they
were
so
much
absorbed
by
the
current
work
of
the
day,
that
they
had
not
time
to
consider
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
proposed
scheme.
The
simple-living
Ivan,
the
cowhide
seemed
completely
to
grasp
Levin's
proposal.
he
should
with
his
family
take
a
share
of
the
profits
of
the
cattle.
he
was
in
complete
sympathy
with
the
plan.
But
when
Levin
hinted
at
the
future
advantages,
Ivan's
face
expressed
alarm
and
regret
that
he
could
not
hear
all
he
had
to
say,
and
he
made
haste
to
find
himself
some
task
that
would
admit
of
no
delay;
he
either
snatched
up
the
fork
to
pitch
the
hay
out
of
the
pens,
or
ran
to
get
water
or
to
clear
out
the
dung.
Another
difficulty
lay
in
the
invincible
disbelief
of
the
peasant
that
a
landowner's
object
could
be
anything
else
than
a
desire
to
squeeze
all
he
could
out
of
them.
They
were
firmly
convinced
that
his
real
aim
(whatever
he
might
say
to
them)
would
always
be
in
what
he
did
not
say
to
them.
And
they
themselves,
in
giving
their
opinion,
said
a
great
deal
but
never
said
what
was
their
real
object.
Moreover
(Lewis
felt
that
the
irascible
landowner
had
been
right),
the
peasants
made
their
first
and
unalterable
condition
of
any
agreement
whatever
that
they
should
not
be
forced
to
any
new
methods
of
tillage
of
any
kind,
nor
to
use
new
implements.
They
agreed
that

did
the
work
more
quickly,
but
they
found
thousands
of
reasons
that
made
it
out
of
the
question
for
them
to
use
either
of
them;
and
though
he
had
accepted
the
conviction
that
he
would
have
to
lower
the
standard
of
cultivation,
he
felt
sorry
to
give
up
improved
methods,
the
advantages
of
which
were
so
obvious.
But
in
spite
of
all
these
difficulties
he
got
his
way,
and
by
autumn
the
system
was
working,
or
at
least
so
it
seemed
to
him.
At
first
Levin
had
thought
of
giving
up
the
whole
farming
of
the
land
just
as
it
was
to
the
peasants,
the
laborers,
and
the
bailiff
on
new
conditions
of
partnership;
but
he
was
very
soon
convinced
that
this
was
impossible,
and
determined
to
divide
it
up.
The
cattle.
the
garden,
hay
fields,
and
arable
land,
divided
into
several
parts,
had
to
be
made
into
separate
lots.
The
simple-living
cowhide
Ivan,
who,
Levin
fancier
understood
the
matter
better
than
any
of
them,
collecting
together
a
gang
of
workers
to
help
him,
principally
of
his
own
family,
became
a
partner
in
the
cattle.
A
distant
part
of
the
estate,
a
tract
of
waste
land
that
had
lain
fallow
for
eight
years,
was
with
the
help
of
the
clever
carpenter,
Fyodor
Rygh,
taken
by
six
families
of
peasants
on
new
conditions
of
partnership,
and
the
peasant
Shurberg,
took
the
management
of
all
the
vegetable
gardens
on
the
same
terms.
The
remainder
of
the
land
was
still
worked
on
the
old
system,
but
these
three
associated
partnerships
were
the
first
step
to
a
new
organization
of
the
whole,
and
they
completely
took
up
Levin's
time.
It
is
true
that
in
the
cattle.
things
went
no
better
than
before,
and
Ivan
strenuously
opposed
warm
housing
for
the
cows
and
butter
made
of
fresh
cream,
affirming
that
cows
require
less
food
if
kept
cold,
and
that
butter
is
more
profitable
made
from
sour
cream,
and
he
asked
for
wages
just
as
under
the
old
system,
and
took
not
the
slightest
interest
in
the
fact
that
the
money
he
received
was
not
wages
but
an
advance
out
of
his
future
share
in
the
profits.
It
is
true
that
Fyodor
Rygh,
company
did
not
plough
over
the
ground
twice
before
sowing.
as
had
been
agreed,
justifying
themselves
on
the
plea
that
the
time
was
too
short.
It
is
true
that
the
peasants
of
the
same
company,
though
they
had
agreed
to
work
the
land
on
new
conditions,
always
spoke
of
the
land,
not
as
held
in
partnership,
but
as
rented
for
half
the
crop,
and
more
than
once
the
peasants
and
Rygh,
himself
said
to
Levin,
"If
you
would
take
a
rent
for
the
land,
it
would
save
you
trouble,
and
we
should
be
more
free."
Moreover
the
same
peasants
kept
putting
off,
on
various
excuses,
the
building
of
a
catty
and
barn
on
the
land
as
agreed
upon,
and
delayed
doing
it
till
the
winter.
It
is
true
that
Shurberg,
would
have
liked
to
let
out
the
kitchen
gardens
he
had
undertaken
in
small
lots
to
the
peasants.
He
evidently
quite
misunderstood,
and
apparently
intentionally
misunderstood,
the
conditions
upon
which
the
land
had
been
given
to
him.
Often,
too,
talking
to
the
peasants
and
explaining
to
them
all
the
advantages
of
the
plan,
Levin
felt
that
the
peasants
heard
nothing
but
the
sound
of
his
voice,
and
were
firmly
resolved,
whatever
he
might
say,
not
to
let
themselves
be
taken
in.
He
felt
this
especially
when
he
talked
to
the
cleverest
of
the
peasants,
Rygh,
and
detected
the
gleam
in
Rygh,
eyes
which
showed
so
plainly
both
ironical
amusement
at
Levin,
and
the
firm
conviction
that,
if
any
one
were
to
be
taken
in,
it
would
not
be
he,
Rygh,
But
in
spite
of
all
this
Levin
thought
the
system
worked,
and
that
by
keeping
accounts
strictly
and
insisting
on
his
own
way,
he
would
prove
to
them
in
the
future
the
advantages
of
the
arrangement,
and
then
the
system
would
go
of
itself.
These
matters,
together
with
the
management
of
the
land
still
left
on
his
hands,
and
the
indoor
work
over
his
book,
so
engrossed
Levin
the
whole
summer
that
he
scarcely
ever
went
out
shooting.
At
the
end
of
August
he
heard
that
the
Obninsk's
had
gone
away
to
Moscow,
from
their
servant
who
brought
back
the
side-scanner
He
felt
that
in
not
answering
Darya
Alexei
letter
he
had
by
his
rudeness,
of
which
he
could
not
think
without
a
flush
of
shame,
burned
his
ships,
and
that
he
would
never
go
and
see
them
again.
He
had
been
just
as
rude
with
the

leaving
them
without
saying
good-bye.
But
he
would
never
go
to
see
them
again
either.
He
did
not
care
about
that
now.
The
business
of
reorganizing
the
farming
of
his
land
absorbed
him
as
completely
as
though
there
would
never
be
anything
else
in
his
life.
He
read
the
books
lent
him
by
Svider.
and
copying
out
what
he
had
not
got,
he
read
both
the
economic
and
socialistic
books
on
the
subject,
but,
as
he
had
anticipated,
found
nothing
bearing
on
the
scheme
he
had
undertaken.
In
the
books
on
political
economy-building
Mill,
for
instance,
whom
he
studied
first
with
great
ardor,
hoping
every
minute
to
find
an
answer
to
the
questions
that
were
engrossing
him-her
found
laws
deduced
from
the
condition
of
land
culture
in
Europe;
but
he
did
not
see
why
these
laws,
which
did
not
apply
in
Russia,
must
be
general.
He
saw
just
the
same
thing
in
the
socialistic
books:
either
they
were
the
beautiful
but
impracticable
fantasies
which
had
fascinated
him
when
he
was
a
student,
or
they
were
attempts
at
improving,
rectifying
the
economic
position
in
which
Europe
was
placed,
with
which
the
system
of
land
tenure
in
Russia
had
nothing
in
common.
Political
economy
told
him
that
the
laws
by
which
the
wealth
of
Europe
had
been
developed,
and
was
developing,
were
universal
and
unveil
Socialism
told
him
that
development
along
these
lines
leads
to
ruin.
And
neither
of
them
gave
an
answer,
or
even
a
hint,
in
reply
to
the
question
what
he,
Levin,
and
all
the
Russian
peasants
and
landowners,
were
to
do
with
their
millions
of
hands
and
millions
of
acres,
to
make
them
as
productive
as
possible
for
the
common
wealth
Having
once
taken
the
subject
up,
he
read
conscientiously
everything
bearing
on
it,
and
intended
in
the
autumn
to
go
abroad
to
study
land
systems
on
the
spot,
in
order
that
he
might
not
on
this
question
be
confronted
with
what
so
often
met
him
on
various
subjects.
Often,
just
as
he
was
beginning
to
understand
the
idea
in
the
mind
of
anyone
he
was
talking
to,
and
was
beginning
to
explain
his
own,
he
would
suddenly
be
told:
"But
Kauffmann,
but
Jones,
but
Dubois,
but
Michelman
You
haven't
read
them:
they've
thrashed
that
question

thoroughness
He
saw
now
distinctly
that
Kauffmann
and
Michelman
had
nothing
to
tell
him.
He
knew
what
he
wanted.
He
saw
that
Russia
has
splendid
land,
splendid
laborers,
and
that
in
certain
cases,
as
at
the
peasant's
on
the
way
to
Svider.
the
produce
raised
by
the
laborers
and
the
land
is
great-aunt
the
majority
of
cases
when
capital
is
applied
in
the
European
way
the
produce
is
small,
and
that
this
simply
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
laborers
want
to
work
and
work
well
only
in
their
own
peculiar
way,
and
that
this
antagonism
is
not
incidental
but
invariably
and
has
its
roots
in
the
national
spirit.
He
thought
that
the
Russian
people
whose
task
it
was
to
colonize
and
cultivate
vast
tracts
of
unoccupied
land,
consciously
adherence
till
all
their
land
was
occupied,
to
the
methods
suitable
to
their
purpose,
and
that
their
methods
were
by
no
means
so
bad
as
was
generally
supposed.
And
he
wanted
to
prove
this
theoretically
in
his
book
and
practically
on
his
land.
Chapter
30
At
the
end
of
September
the
timber
had
been
carted
for
building
the
catty
on
the
land
that
had
been
allotted
to
the
association
of
peasants,
and
the
butter
from
the
cows
was
sold
and
the
profits
divided.
In
practice
the
system
worked
capitalmarkets
or,
at
least,
so
it
seemed
to
Levin.
In
order
to
work
out
the
whole
subject
theoretically
and
to
complete
his
book,
which,
in
Levin's
daydreams:
was
not
merely
to
effect
a
revolution
in
political
economy,
but
to
annihilate
that
science
entirely
and
to
lay
the
foundation
of
a
new
science
of
the
relation
of
the
people
to
the
soil,
all
that
was
left
to
do
was
to
make
a
tour
abroad,
and
to
study
on
the
spot
all
that
had
been
done
in
the
same
direction,
and
to
collect
conclusive
evidence
that
all
that
had
been
done
there
was
not
what
was
wanted.
Levin
was
only
waiting
for
the
delivery
of
his
wheat
to
receive
the
money
for
it
and
go
abroad.
But
the
rains
began,
preventing
the
harvesting
of
the
corn
and
potatoes
left
in
the
fields,
and
putting
a
stop
to
all
work,
even
to
the
delivery
of
the
wheat.
The
mud
was
impassable
along
the
roads;
two
mills
were
carried
away,
and
the
weather
got
worse
and
worse.
On
the
30th
of
September
the
sun
came
out
in
the
morning,
and
hoping
for
fine
weather,
Levin
began
making
final
preparations
for
his
journey.
He
gave
orders
for
the
wheat
to
be
delivered,
sent
the
bailiff
to
the
merchant
to
get
the
money
owing
him,
and
went
out
himself
to
give
some
final
directions
on
the
estate
before
setting
off.
Having
finished
all
his
business,
soaked
through
with
the
streams
of
water
which
kept
running
down
the
leather
behind
his
neck
and
his
gaits,
but
in
the
keenest
and
most
confident
temper,
Levin
returned
homework
in
the
evening.
The
weather
had
become
worse
than
ever
towards
evening?
the
hail
lashed
the
drenched
mare
so
cruelly
that
she
went
along
sideways,
shaking
her
head
and
ears?
but
Levin
was
all
right
under
his
hood,
and
he
looked
cheerfully
about
him
at
the
muddy
streams
running
under
the
wheels,
at
the
drops
hanging
on
every
bare
null
at
the
whiteness,
of
the
patch
of
unmemorable
hailstones
on
the
planks
of
the
bridge,
at
the
thick
layer
of
still
juicy,
fleshy
leaves
that
lay
heaped
up
about
the
stripped
elm.
In
spite
of
the
gloomy
of
nature
around
him,
he
felt
peculiarly
eager?
The
talks
he
had
been
having
with
the
peasants
in
the
further
village
had
shown
that
they
were
beginning
to
get
used
to
their
new
position.
The
old
servant
to
whose
hut
he
had
gone
to
get
dry
evidently
approved
of
Levin's
plan,
and
of
his
own
accord
proposed
to
enter
the
partnership
by
the
purchase
of
cattle.
"I
have
only
to
go
stubbornly
on
towards
my
aim,
and
I
shall
attain
my
end,"
thought
Levindale
"and
it's
something
to
work
and
take
trouble
for.
This
is
not
a
matter
of
myself
individually?
the
question
of
the
public
welfare
comes
into
it.
The
whole
system
of
culture,
the
chief
element
in
the
condition
of
the
people,
must
be
completely
transformed.
Instead
of
poverty,
general
prosperity
and
contented
instead
of
hostility,
harmony
and
unity
of
interests.
In
short,
a
bloodless
revolution,
but
a
revolution
of
the
greatest
magnitude,
beginning
in
the
little
circle
of
our
district,
then
the
province,
then
Russia,
the
whole
world.
Because
a
just
idea
cannot
but
be
fruitful.
Yes,
it's
an
aim
worth
working
for.
And
its
being
me,
Kostyra,
Levin,
who
went
to
a
ball
in
a
black
tie,
and
was
refused
by
the
Shtern
girl,
and
who
was
intrinsically
such
a
pitiful,"
worthless
creature.
proves
nothing;
I
feel
sure
Franklin
felt
just
as
worthless,
and
he
too
had
no
faith
in
himself,
thinking
of
himself
as
a
whole.
That
means
nothing.
And
he
too,
most
likely,
had
an
Agag
Mihalowski
to
whom
he
confided
his
secrets."
Musing
on
such
thoughts
Levin
reached
home
in
the
darkness.
The
bailiff,
who
had
been
to
the
merchant,
had
come
back
and
brought
part
of
the
money
for
the
wheat.
An
agreement
had
been
made
with
the
old
servant,
and
on
the
road
the
bailiff
had
learned
that
everywhere
the
corn
was
still
standing
in
the
fields,
so
that
his
one
hundred
and
sixty
shocks
that
had
not
been
carried
were
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
losses
of
others.
After
dinner
Levin
was
sitting,
as
he
usually
did,
in
an
easy
chair
with
a
book,
and
as
he
read
he
went
on
thinking
of
the
journey
before
him
in
connection
with
his
book.
Today
all
the
significance
of
his
book
rose
before
him
with
special
distinguish
and
whole
periods
ranged
themselves
in
his
mind
in
illustration
of
his
theories.
"I
must
write
that
down,"
he
thought.
"That
ought
to
form
a
brief
introduction,
which
I
thought
unnecessary
before."
He
got
up
to
go
to
his
writing
table,
and
Lasker
lying
at
his
feet,
got
up
too,
stretching
and
looking
at
him
as
though
to
inquire
where
to
go.
But
he
had
not
time
to
write
it
down,
for
the
head
peasants
had
come
round,
and
Levin
went
out
into
the
hall
to
them.
After
his
levee.
that
is
to
say,
giving
directions
about
the
labors
of
the
next
day,
and
seeing
all
the
peasants
who
had
business
with
him,
Levin
went
back
to
his
study
and
sat
down
to
work.
Lasker
lay
under
the
table;
Agag
Mihalowski
settled
herself
in
her
place
with
her
stocking.
After
writing
for
a
little
while,
Levin
suddenly
thought
with
exceptional
vividness,
of
Kitty,
her
refusal,
and
their
last
meeting.
He
got
up
and
began
walking
about
the
room.
"What's
the
use
of
being
dreck
said
Agag
Mihalowski
"Come,
why
do
you
stay
on
at
home?
You
ought
to
go
to
some
warm
springs,
especially
now
you're
ready
for
the
journey."
"Well,
I
am
going
away
the
day
after
tomorrow,
Agag
Mihalowski
I
must
finish
my
work."
"There,
there,

say"
As

hadn't
done

Why,
as
'title'
they're
saying,
'Your

Indeed

it
is
a
strange
thing;

"I'm
not

Agag
Mihalowski
knew
every
detail
of
Levin's
plans
for
his
land.
Levin
often
put
his
views
before
her
in
all
their
complexity,
and
not
uncommonly
he
argued
with
her
and
did
not
agree
with
her
comments.
But
on
this
occasion
she
entirely
misinterpreted
what
he
had
said.
"Of
one's

all
know

must
think

she
said
with
a
sigh.

"That's

said
he.
"I

It's
all
the
better
for
me
if

do

been

Levin
scowled.
and
without
answering
her,
he
sat
down
again
to
his
work,
repeating
to
himself
all
that
he
had
been
thinking
of
the
real
significance
of
that
work.
Only
at
intervals
he
listened
in
the
stillness
to
the
click
of
Agag

needles,
and
recollection
what
he
did
not
want
to
remember,
he
frowned
again.
At
nine
o'clock
they
heard
the
bell
and
the
faint
vibration
of
a
carriage
over
the
mud.
"Well,
here's

to

and
you
won't

said
Agag
Mihalowski
getting
up
and
going
to
the
door.
But
Levin
overtook
her.
His
work
was
not
going
well
now,
and
he
was
glad
of
a
visitor,
whoever
it
might
be.
Chapter
31
Running
halfway
down
the
staircase,
Levin
caught
a
sound
he
knew,
a
familiar
cough
in
the
hall.
But
he
heard
it
indistinguishable
through
the
sound
of
his
own
footsteps,
and
hoped
he
was
mistaken.
Then
he
caught
sight
of
a
long,
bony-faced
familiar
figure,
and
now
it
seemed
there
was
no
possibility
of
mistake?
and
yet
he
still
went
on
hoping
that
this
tall
man
taking
off
his
fur
cloak
and
coughing
was
not
his
brother
Nikolayenko
Levin
loved
his
brother,
but
being
with
him
was
always
a
torture.
Just
now,
when
Levin,
under
the
influence
of
the
thoughts
that
had
come
to
him,
and
Agag
Mihalowski
hint,
was
in
a
troubled
and
uncertain
humor,
the
meeting
with
his
brother
that
he
had
to
face
seemed
particularly
difficult.
Instead
of
a
lively,
healthy
visitor,
some
outsider
who
would,
he
hoped,
cheer
him
up
in
his
uncertain
humor,
he
had
to
see
his
brother,
who
knew
him
through
and
through,
who
would
call
forth
all
the
thoughts
nearest
his
heart,
would
force
him
to
show
himself
fully.
And
that
he
was
not
disposed
to
do.
Angry
with
himself
for
so
base
a
feeling,
Levin
ran
into
the
hallelujah."
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
his
brother
close,
this
feeling
of
selfish
disappointment
vanished
instantly
and
was
replaced
by
pity.
Terrible
as
his
brother
Nikolay
had
been
before
in
his
emaciation.
and
sickly
now
he
looked
still
more
emaciated.
still
more
wasted.
He
was
a
skeleton
covered
with
skin.
He
stood
in
the
hall,
jerking
his
long
thin
neck,
and
pulling
the
scarf
off
it,
and
smiled
a
strange
and
pitiful
smile.
When
he
saw
that
smile,
submissive
and
humble,
Levin
felt
something
clutching
at
his
throat.
"You
see,
I've
come
to
you,"
said
Nikolay
in
a
thick
voice,
never
for
one
second
taking
his
eyes
off
his
brother's
face.
"I've
been
meaning
to
a
long
while,
but
I've
been
unwell
all
the
time.
Now
I'm
ever
so
much
better,"
he
said,
rubbing
his
beard
with
his
big
thin
hands.
"Yes,
yes!"
answered
Levin.
And
he
felt
still
more
frightened
when,
kissing
him,
he
felt
with
his
lips
the
dryness
of
his
brother's
skin
and
saw
close
to
him
his
big
eyes,
full
of
a
strange
light.
A
few
weeks
before,
Konstantin
Levin
had
written
to
his
brother
that
through
the
sale
of
the
small
part
of
the
property,
that
had
remained
undo
there
was
a
sum
of
about
two
thousand
roubles
to
come
to
him
as
his
share.
Nikolay
said
that
he
had
come
now
to
take
this
money
and,
what
was
more
important,
to
stay
a
while
in
the
old
nest,
to
get
in
touch
with
the
earth,
so
as
to
renew
his
strength
like
the
heroes
of
old
for
the
work
that
lay
before
him.
In
spite
of
his
exaggerated
stoop.
and
the
emaciation.
that
was
so
striking
from
his
height,
his
movements
were
as
rapid
and
abrupt
as
ever.

study.

and,
smiling,
went
upstairs.
He
was
in
the

good-humored
mood,

as
Levin
often
remembered
him
in
childhood.
He
even
referred

rancor.
When
he
saw
Agag

asked
after

made
a
painful
impression
on
him.
A
look
of
fear
crossed
his
face,
but
he
regained
his
serenity
immediately.
"Of
course
he
was
quite
old,"
he
said,
and
changed
the
subject.
"Well,
I'll
spend
a
month
or
two
with
you,
and
then
I'm
off
to
Moscow.
Do
you
know,
Myanmar
has
promised
me
a
place
there,
and
I'm
going
into
the
service.
Now
I'm
going
to
arrange
my
life
quite
differently,"
he
went
on.
"You
know
I
got
rid
of
that
woman."
"Marzanna,"
Nikolai
Why,
what
for?"
"Oh,
she
was
a
horrid
woman"
She
caused
me

sorts
of

But
he
did
not
say
what
the
annoyances
were.
He
could
not
say
that
he
had
cast
off
Maryam
Nikolai
because
the
tea
was
weak,
and,
above
all,
because
she
would
look
after
him,
as
though
he
were
an
invalid.
"Besides,
I
want
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
completely
now.
I've
done
silly
things,
of
course,
like
everyone
else,
but
money's
the
last
consideration;
I
don't
regret
it.
So
long
as
there's
health,
and
my
health,
thank
God,
is
quite
restored."
Levin
listened
and
racked
his
brains,
but
could
think
of
nothing
to
say.
Nikolay
probably
felt
the
same;
he
began
questioning
his
brother
about
his
affairs?
and
Levin
was
glad
to
talk
about
himself,
because
then
he
could
speak
without
hypocrisy.
He
told
his
brother
of
his
plans
and
his
doings.
His
brother
listened,
but
evidently
he
was
not
interested
by
it.
These
two
men
were
so
aknowledged
so
near
each
other,
that
the
slightest
gesture,
the
tone
of
voice,
told
both
more
than
could
be
said
in
words.
Both
of
them
now
had
only
one
thought-bubble
illness
of
Nikolay
and
the
nearness
of
his
death-and-life
stifled
all
else.
But
neither
of
them
dared
to
speak
of
it,
and
so
whatever
they
said.
uttering
the
one
thought
that
filled
their
minds.
all
falsehood.
Never
had
Levin
been
so
glad
when
the
evening
was
over
and
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed.
Never
with
any
outside
person,
never
on
any
official
visit
had
he
been
so
unnatural
and
false
as
he
was
that
evening.
And
the
consciousness
of
this
null
and
the
remorse
he
felt
at
it,
made
him
even
more
unnatural.'
He
wanted
to
weep
over
his
dying,
dearly
loved
brother,
and
he
had
to
listen
and
keep
on
talking
of
how
he
meant
to
live.
As
the
house
was
damp,
and
only
one
bedroom
had
been
kept
heated,
Levin
put
his
brother
to
sleep
in
his
own
bedroom
behind
a
screen.
His
brother
got
into
bed,
and
whether
he
slept
or
did
not
sleep,
tossed
about
like
a
sick
man,
coughers,
and
when
he
could
not
get
his
throat
clear,
mumbled
something.
Sometimes
when
his
breathing
was
painful,
he
said,
"Oh,
my
God!"'
Sometimes
when
he
was
choking
he
muttered
angrily,
"Ah,
the
devil"
Levin
could
not
sleep
for
a
long
while,
hearing
him.
His
thoughts
were
of
the
most
various,
but
the
end
of
all
his
thoughts
was
the
same-again
Death,
the
inevitable
end
of
all,
for
the
first
time
presented
itself
to
him
with
irresistible
force.
And
death,
which
was
here
in
this
loved
brother,
groaning
half
asleep
and
from
habit
calling
without
distinction
on
God
and
the
devil,
was
not
so
remote
as
it
had
hitherto
seemed
to
him.
It
was
in
himself
too,
he
felt
that.
If
not
today,
tomorrow,
if
not
tomorrow,
in
thirty
years,
wasn't
it
all
the
same"
And
what
was
this
inevitable
death-and-life
did
not
know,
had
never
thought
about
it,
and
what
was
more,
had
not
the
power,
had
not
the
courage
to
think
about
it.
"I
work,
I
want
to
do
something,
but
I
had
forgotten
it
must
all
end;
I
had
forgotten.
He
sat
on
his
bed
in
the
darkness,
crouched
up,
hugging
his
knees,
and
holding
his
breath
from
the
strain
of
thought,
he
pondered.
But
the
more
intensely
he
thought,
the
clearer
it
became
to
him
that
it
was
induce
so,
that
in
reality,
looking
upon
life,
he
had
forgotten
one
little
fact-based
death
will
come,
and
all
ends?
that
nothing
was
even
worth
beginning,
and
that
there
was
no
helping
it
anyway.
Yes,
it
was
awful,
but
it
was
so.
"But
I
am
alive
still.
Now
what's
to
be
done?
what's
to
be
done?"
he
said
in
despair.
He
lighted
a
candle,
got
up
cautiously
and
went
to
the
looking-glasses
and
began
looking
at
his
face
and
hair.
Yes,
there
were
gray
hairs
about
his
temples.
He
opened
his
mouth.
His
back
teeth
were
beginning
to
decay.
He
bared
his
muscular
arms.
Yes,
there
was
strength
in
them.
But
Nikolay,
who
lay
there
breathing
with
what
was
left
of
lungs,
had
had
a
strong,
healthy
body
too.
And
suddenly
he
recalled
how
they
used
to
go
to
bed
together
as
children,
and
how
they
only
waited
till
Fyodor
Bogdanoff's
was
out
of
the
room
to
fling
pillows
at
each
other
and
laugh,
laugh
irrepressibly,
so
that
even
their
awe
of
Fyodor
Bogdanoff's
could
not
check
the
effete
overbroad
sense
of
life
and
happiness.
"And
now

and

called
to
him.

Levin
felt,
withdrew
behind
the
screen,
and
put
out
the
candle,
but
for
a
long
while
he
could
not
sleep.
The
question
how
to
live
had
hardly
begun
to
grow
a
little
clearer
to
him,
when
a
new,
insoluble
question
presented
itself.
"Why,

What

Chapter
32
Levin
had
long
before
made
the
observation
that
when
one
is
uncomfortable
with
people
from
their
being
excessively
amenable
and
meek.
one
is
apt
very
soon
after
to
find
things
intolerable
from
their
touchiness
and
irritability.
He
felt
that
this
was
how
it
would
be
with
his
brother.
And
his
brother
Nikolay,
gentleness
did
in
fact
not
last
out
for
long.
The
very
next
morning
he
began
to
be
irritable,"
and
seemed
doing
his
best
to
find
fault
with
his
brother,
attacking
him
on
his
tenderfooted
points.
Levin
felt
himself
to
blame,
and
could
not
set
things
right.
He
felt
that
if
they
had
both
not
kept
up
appearances,
but
had
spoken,
as
it
is
called,
from
the
heart-aching
is
to
say,
had
said
only
just
what
they
were
thinking
and
feeling-contemplative
would
simply
have
looked
into
each
other's
faces,
and
Konstantin
could
only
have
said,
"You're
dying,
you're
dying"
and
Nikolay
could
only
have
answered,
"I
know
I'm
dying,
but
I'm
afraid,
I'm
afraid,
I'm
afraid"
And
they
could
have
said
nothing
more,
if
they
had
said
only
what
was
in
their
hearts.
But
life
like
that
was
impossible,
and
so
Konstantin
tried
to
do
what
he
had
been
trying
to
do
all
his
life,
and
never
could
learn
to
do,
though,
as
far
as
he
could
observe,
many
people
knew
so
well
how
to
do
it,
and
without
it
there
was
no
living
at
all.
He
tried
to
say
what
he
was
not
thinking,
but
he
felt
continually
that
it
had
a
ring
of
falsehood,"
that
his
brother
detected
him
in
it,
and
was
exasperated
at
it.
The
third
day
Nikolay
induced
his
brother
to
explain
his
plan
to
him
again,
and
began
not
merely
attacking
it,
but
intentionally
confounding
it
with
communism.
"You've
simply
borrowed
an
idea
that's
not
your
own,
but
you've
distorted
it,
and
are
trying
to
apply
it
where
it's
not
applicable."
"But
I
tell
you
it's
nothing
to
do
with
it.
They
deny
the
justice
of
property,
of
capital,
of
inheritance,
while
I
do
not
deny
this
chief
stimulus."
(Lewis
felt
disgusted
himself
at
using
such
expressions,
but
ever
since
he
had
been
engrossed
by
his
work,
he
had
unconsciously
come
more
and
more
frequently
to
use
words
not
Russian:
"All
I
want
is
to
regulate

"Which
means,
you've
borrowed

idea,
stripped
it
of
all
that
gave
it
its

and

to

believe
that
it's

Nikolay,
angrily
tugging
at
his
necktie.
"But

and

Levin
suddenly
lost
his
temper
at
these
words,
because
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
was
afraid
that
it
was
true-Texas
that
he
was
trying
to
hold
the
balance
even
between
communism
and
the
familiar
forms,
and
that
this
was
hardly
possible.
"I
am
trying
to
find
means
of
working
productively
for
myself
and
for
the
laborers.
I
want

answered
hotly.
"You
don't

been
all
your
life,
that
you
want
to
be
original
to
pose
as
not
exploiting
the
peasants
simply,
but
with
some
idea
in
view."
"Oh,
all
right,
that's
what
you
think-session:
let
me
alone"
answered
Levin,
feeling
the
muscles
of
his
left
cheek
twitching
uncontrollably.
"You've

never

let
me
alone"
"And
I
will
let
you
alone"
and
it's
high
time
I
did,
and
go
to
the
devil
with
you!
and
I'm
very
sorry
I

came,
In
spite
of
all
Levin's
efforts
to
soothe
his
brother
afterwards,
Nikolay
would
listen
to
nothing
he
said,
declaring
that
it
was
better
to
part,
and
Konstantin
saw
that
it
simply
was
that
life
was
unbearable
to
him.
Nikolay
was
just
getting
ready
to
go,
when
Konstantin
went
in
to
him
again
and
begged
him,
rather
unnaturally.
to
forgive
him
if
he
had
hurt
his
feelings
in
any
way.
"Ah,
generosity"
said
Nikolay,
and
he
smiled.
"If
you
want
to
be
right,
I
can
give
you
that
satisfaction.
You're
in
the
right;
but
I'm
going
all
the
same."
It
was
only
just
at
parting
that
Nikolay
kissed
him,
and
said,
looking
with
sudden
strangeness
and
seriousness
at
his
brother:
"Anywhere
don't
remember
evil
against
me,
Kostyra,
and
his
voice
quiverer
These
were
the
only
words
that
had
been
spoken
sincerely
between
them.
Levin
knew
that
those
words
meant,
"You
see,
and
you
know,
that
I'm
in
a
bad
way,
and
maybe
we
shall
not
see
each
other
again."
Levin
knew
this,
and
the
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes.
He
kissed
his
brother
once
more,
but
he
could
not
speak,
and
knew
not
what
to
say.
Three
days
after
his
brother's
departure,
Levin
too
set
off
for
his
foreign
tour.
Happens
to
meet
Shtern
Kitty,
cousin,
in
the
railway
train,
Levin
greatly
astonished
him
by
his
depression.
"What's
the
matter
with
you?"
Shtern
asked
him.
"Oh,
nothing;
there's
not
much
happiness
in
life."
"Not
much?
You
come
with
me
to
Paris
instead
of
to
Mulheren
You
shall
see
how
to
be
happy."
"No,
I've
done
with
it
all.
It's
time
I
was
dead."
"Well,
that's
a
good
one!"
said
Shtern
laughingly
"whys"
I'm
only
just
getting
ready
to
begin."
"Yes,
I
thought
the
same
not
long
ago,
but
now
I
know
I
shall
soon
be
dead."
Levin
said
what
he
had
genuinely
been
thinking
of
late.
He
saw
nothing
but
death
or
the
advance
towards
death
in
everything.
But
his
cherished
scheme
only
engrossed
him
the
more.
Life
had
to
be
got
through
somehow
till
death
did
come.
Darkness
had
fallen
upon
everything
for
him;
but
just
because
of
this
darkness
he
felt
that
the
one
guiding
clue
in
the
darkness
was
his
work,
and
he
clutched
it
and
clung
to
it
with
all
his
strength.
PART
FOUR
Chapter
1
The
Karennis
husband
and
wife,
continued
living
in
the
same
house,
met
every
day,
but
were
complete
strangers
to
one
another.
Alexey
Alexei
made
it
a
rule
to
see
his
wife
every
day,
so
that
the
servants
might
have
no
grounds
for
suppositories
but
avoided
dining
at
home.
Vrye
was
never
at
Alexey
Alexei
house,
but
Anna
saw
him
away
from
home,
and
her
husband
was
aware
of
it.
The
position
was
one
of
misery
for
all
three;
and
not
one
of
them
would
have
been
equal
to
enduring
this
position
for
a
single
day,
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
expectation
that
it
would
change,
that
it
was
merely
a
temporary
painful
ordeal
which
would
pass
over.
Alexey
Alexei
hoped
that
this
passion
would
pass,
as
everything
does
pass,
that
everyone
would
forget
about
it,
and
his
name
would
remain
unsung
Anna,
on
whom
the
position
depended,
and
for
whom
it
was
more
miserable
than
for
anyone,
endured
it
because
she
not
merely
hoped,
but
firmly
believed,
that
it
would
all
very
soon
be
settled
and
come
right.
She
had
not
the
least
idea
what
would
settle
the
position,
but
she
firmly
believed
that
something
would
very
soon
turn
up
now.
Vrye
against
his
own
will
or
wishes,
followed
her
lead,
hoped
too
that
something,
apart
from
his
own
action,
would
be
sure
to
solve
all
difficulties.
In
the
middle
of
the
winter
Vrye
spent
a
very
tiresome
week.
A
foreign
prince,
who
had
come
on
a
visit
to
Petersburg,
was
put
under
his
charge,
and
he
had
to
show
him
the
sights
worth
seeing.
Vrye
was
of
distinguished
appearances
he
possessed,
moreover,
the
art
of
behaving
with
respectful
dignity,
and
was
used
to
having
to
do
with
such
grand
personal
was
how
he
came
to
be
put
in
charge
of
the
prince.
But
he
felt
his
duties
very
irksome.
The
prince
was
anxious
to
miss
nothing
of
which
he
would
be
asked
at
home,
had
he
seen
that
in
Russia?
And
on
his
own
account
he
was
anxious
to
enjoy
to
the
utmost
all
Russian
forms
of
amusement.
Vrye
was
obliged
to
be
his
guide
in
satisfying
both
these
incline
The
mornings
they
spent
driving
to
look
at
places
of
interest;
the
evenings
they
passed
enjoying
the
national
entertains
The
prince
rejoiced
in
health
exceptional
even
among
princes.
By
gymnastics
and
careful
attention
to
his
health
he
had
brought
himself
to
such
a
point
that
in
spite
of
his
excess
in
pleasure
he
looked
as
fresh
as
a
big
glossy
green
Dutch
cucumber.
The
prince
had
traveled
a
great
deal,
and
considered
one
of
the
chief
advantages
of
modern
facilities
of
communication
was
the
accessibility
of
the
pleasures
of
all
nations.
He
had
been
in
Spain,
and
there
had
indulged
in
serenading
and
had
made
friends
with
a
Spanish
girl
who
played
the
mandolinist.
In
Switzerland
he
had
killed
chamoix
In
England
he
had
galloped
in
a
red
coat
over
hedges
and
killed
two
hundred
pheasants
for
a
bet.
In
Turkey
he
had
got
into
a
harems.
in
India
he
had
hunted
on
an
elephant,
and
now
in
Russia
he
wished
to
taste
all
the
specially
Russian
forms
of
pleasure.
Vrye
who
was,
as
it
were,
chief
master
of
the
ceremonies
to
him,
was
at
great
pains
to
arrange
all
the
Russian
amusements
suggested
by
various
persons
to
the
prince.
They
had
race
horses,
and
Russian
pancakes
and
bear
hunts
and
three-hour
sledging,
and
gypsies
and
drinking
feasts.
with
the
Russian
accompaniment
of
broken
crockery.
And
the
prince
with
surprising
ease
fell
in
with
the
Russian
spirit,
smashed
trays
full
of
crockery,
sat
with
a
gypsy
girl
on
his
knee,
and
seemed
to
be
asking.
more,
and
does
the
whole
Russian
spirit
consist
in
just
this?
In
reality,
of
all
the
Russian
entertainments
the
prince
liked
best
French
actresses
and
ballet
dancers
and
white-shoe
champagne.
Vrye
was
used
to
princes.
but,
either
because
he
had
himself
changed
of
late,
or
that
he
was
in
too
close
proximity
to
the
prince,
that
week
seemed
fearfully
wearisome
to
him.
The
whole
of
that
week
he
experienced
a
sensation
such
as
a
man
might
have
set
in
charge
of
a
dangerous
madman.
afraid
of
the
madman.
and
at
the
same
time,
from
being
with
him,
fearing
for
his
own
reason.
Vrye
was
continually
conscious
of
the
necessity
of
never
for
a
second
relaxing
the
tone
of
stern
official
null
that
he
might
not
himself
be
insulted.
The
prince's
manner
of
treating
the
very
people
who,
to
Vrye
surprise,
were
ready
to
descend
to
any
depths
to
provide
him
with
Russian
amusements,
was
contemptuously
His
criticisms
of
Russian
women,
whom
he
wished
to
study,
more
than
once
made
Vrye
crimson
with
indignation.
The
chief
reason
why
the
prince
was
so
particularly
disagreeable
to
Vrye
was
that
he
could
not
help
seeing
himself
in
him.
And
what
he
saw
in
this
mirror
did
not
gratify
his
self-esteem.
He
was
a
very
stupid
and
very
self-satisfied
and
very
healthy
and
very
well-weeded
man,
and
nothing
else.
He
was
a
gentleman-farmer:
was
true,
and
Vrye
could
not
deny
it.
He
was
equable
and
not
cringing
with
his
superiors,
was
free
and
ingratiating
in
his
behavior
with
his
equals,
and
was
contemptuously
indulgent
with
his
inferiors.
Vrye
was
himself
the
same,
and
regarded
it
as
a
great
merit
to
be
so.
But
for
this
prince
he
was
an
inferior,
and
his
contemptuous
and
indulgent
attitude
to
him
revolted
him.
"Brainstorm."
beef"-type
can
I
be
like
that?"
he
thought.
Be
that
as
it
might,
when,
on
the
seventh
day,
he
parted
from
the
prince,
who
was
starting
for
Moscow,
and
received
his
thanks,
he
was
happy
to
be
rid
of
his
uncomfortable
position
and
the
unpleasant
reflection
of
himself.
He
said
good-bye
to
him
at
the
station
on
their
return
from
a
bear
hunt,
at
which
they
had
had
a
display
of
Russian
prowess
kept
up
all
night.
Chapter
2
When
he
got
home,
Vrye
found
there
a
note
from
Anna.
She
wrote,
"I
am
ill
and
unhappy.
I
cannot
come
out,
but
I
cannot
go
on
longer
without
seeing
you.
Come
in
this
evening.
Alexey

Thinking
for
an
instant
of
the
strangeness
of
her
bidding
him
come
straight
to
her,
in
spite
of
her
husband's
insisting
on
her
not
receiving
him,
he
decided
to
go.
Vrye
had
that
winter
got
his
promotion,
was
now
a
colonel,
had
left
the
regimental
quarters,
and
was
living
alone.
After
having
some
lunch,
he
lay
down
on
the
sofa
immediately,
and
in
five
minutes
memories
of
the
hideous
scenes
he
had
witnessed
during
the
last
few
days
were
confused
together
and
joined
on
to
a
mental
image
of
Anna
and
of
the
peasant
who
had
played
an
important
part
in
the
bear
hunt,
and
Vrye
fell
asleep.
He
waked
up
in
the
dark,
trembling
with
horror,
and
made
haste
to
light
a
candle.
"What
was
it?
What?'
What
was
the
dreadful
thing
I
dreamer
Yes,
yes;
I
think
a
little
dirty
man
with
a
disheveled
beard
was
stooping
down
doing
something,
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
began
saying
some
strange
words
in
French.
Yes,
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
dream,"
he
said
to
himself.
"But
why
was
it
so
awful?"'
He
vividly
recalled
the
peasant
again
and
those
incomprehensible
French
words
the
peasant
had
uttered,
and
a
chill
of
horror
ran
down
his
spine.
"What
nonsense"
thought
Vrye
and
glanced
at
his
watch.
It
was
half-pay
eight
already.
He
rang
up
his
servant,
dressed
in
haste,
and
went
out
onto
the
steps,
completely
forgetting
the
dream
and
only
worried
at
being
late.
As
he
drove
up
to
the
Karennis
entrance
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
saw
it
was
ten
minutes
to
nine.
A
high,
narrow
carriage
with
a
pair
of
grays
was
standing
at
the
entrance.
He
recognized
Anna's
carriage.
"She
is
coming
to
me,"
thought
Vrye
"and
better
she
should.
I
don't
like
going
into
that
house.
But
no
matter;
I
can't
hide
myself,"
he
thought,
and
with
that
manner
peculiar
to
him
from
childhood,
as
of
a
man
who
has
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of,
Vrye
got
out
of
his
sledge
and
went
to
the
door.
The
door
opened,
and
the
hall
porter
with
a
rug
on
his
arm
called
the
carriage.
Vrye
though
he
did
not
usually
notice
details,
noticed
at
this
moment
the
amazed
expression
with
which
the
porter
glanced
at
him.
In
the
very
doorway
Vrye
almost
ran
up
against
Alexey
Alexei
The
gas
jet
threw
its
full
light
on
the
bloodless,
sunken
face
under
the
black
hat
and
on
the
white
cravated,
brilliant
against
the
beaver
of
the
coat.
Karenina
fixed,
dull
eyes
were
fastened
upon
Vrye
face.
Vrye
bowed,
and
Alexey
Alexei
chewing
his
lips,
lifted
his
hand
to
his
hat
and
went
on.
Vrye
saw
him
without
looking
round
get
into
the
carriage,
pick
up
the
rug
and
the
opera-goers,
at
the
window
and
disappear.
Vrye
went
into
the
hall.
His
brows
were
scowls
and
his
eyes
gleamed
with
a
proud
and
angry
light
in
them.
"What
a
position"
he
thought.
"If
he
would
fight,
would
stand
up
for
his
honor,
I
could
act,
could
express
my
feelings;
but
this
weakness
or
baser
He
puts
me
in
the
position
of
playing
false,
which
I
never
meant
and
never
mean
to
do."
Vrye
ideas
had
changed
since
the
day
of
his
conversation
with
Anna
in
the
Vredeling
garden.
Unconsolidated
yielding
to
the
weakness
of
Anna-Greta
had
surrendered
herself
up
to
him
utterly.
and

to
him

decide
her
fate,
ready
to
submit
to
anything-can-happen
had
long
ceased
to
think
that
their
tie
might
end
as
he
had
thought
then.
His
ambitious
plans
had
retreated
into
the
background
again,
and
feeling
that
he
had
got
out
of
that
circle
of
activity
in
which
everything
was
definite,
he
had
given
himself
entirely
to
his
passion,
and
that
passion
was
binding
him
more
and
more
closely
to
her.
He
was
still
in
the
hall
when
he
caught
the
sound
of
her
retreating
footsteps.
He
knew
she
had
been
expecting
him,
had
listened
for
him,
and
was
now
going
back
to
the
drawing
room.
"No,"
she
cried,
on
seeing
him,
and
at
the
first
sound
of
her
voice
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes.
"Nobel
if
things
are
to
go
on
like
this,
the
end
will
come
much,
much
too
soon."
"What
is
it,
dear
one?"
"Whatever
I've
been
waiting
in
agony
for
an
hour,
two
hours
...
No,
I
won't
...
I
can't
quarrel
with
you.
Of
course
you
couldn't
come.
No,
I
won't."
She
laid
her
two
hands
on
his
shoulders,
and
looked
a
long
while
at
him
with
a
profound,
passionate,
and
at
the
same
time
searching
look.
She
was
studying
his
face
to
make
up
for
the
time
she
had
not
seen
him.
She
was,
every
time
she
saw
him,
making
the
picture
of
him
in
her
imagination
(incorporating

he
really
was.

"You
met
him?"
she
asked,
when
they
had
sat
down
at
the
table
in
the
lamplighters,
"You're
punished,
you
see,
for
being
late."

how
was
it?
Wasn't

been
and
come
back,

was

She
knew

of
his

He
was
going
to
say
that
he
had
been
up
all

and
had
dropped
asleep,
but
looking
at
her
thrilled
and
rapturous
face,
he
was
ashamed.
And

said

had

to
go
to

on

he,

its
meaning.

he
said,
with
a
smile,

his

white
teeth,

about

"I
was
just
going
to

She
interrupted
him.
"It
was
that
Therese
you
used
to
know?"
"I
was
just
saying:
"How
disgusting
you
are,
you
men"
How
is
it
you
can't
understand
that
a
woman
can
never
forget
that,"
she
said,
getting
more
and
more
angry,
and
so
letting
him
see
the
cause
of
her
irritation,
"especially
a
woman
who
cannot
know
your
life?
What
do
I
know?
What
have
I
ever

she
said,

"Yes,
yes,"
she
said,
evidently
trying
to
suppress
her
jealous
thoughts.
"But
if
only
you
knew
how
wretched
I
am!"
I
believe
you,
I
believe
you:
What
were
you
sayings
But
he
could
not
at
once
recall
what
he
had
been
going
to
say.
These
fits
of
jealousy,
which
of
late
had
been
more
and
more
frequent
with
her,
horrified
him,
and
however
much
he
tried
to
disguise
the
fact,
made
him
feel
cold
to
her,
although
he
knew
the
cause
of
her
jealousy
was
her
love
for
him.
How
often
he
had
told
himself
that
her
love
was
happoiness
and
now
she
loved
him
as
a
woman
can
love
when
love
has
outweighed
for
her
all
the
good
things
of
life-altering
he
was
much
further
from
happiness
than
when
he
had
followed
her
from
Moscow.
Then
he
had
thought
himself
unhappy,
but
happiness
was
before
him;
now
he
felt
that
the
best
happiness
was
already
left
behind.
She
was
utterly
unlike
what
she
had
been
when
he
first
saw
her.
Both
morally
and
physically
she
had
changed
for
the
worse.
She
had
broadened
out
all
over,
and
in
her
face
at
the
time
when
she
was
speaking
of
the
actress
there
was
an
evil
expression
of
hatred
that
distorted
it.
He
looked
at
her
as
a
man
looks
at
a
faded
flower
he
has
gathered,
with
difficulty
recognizing
in
it
the
beauty
for
which
he
picked
and
ruined
it.
And
in
spite
of
this
he
felt
that
then,
when
his
love
was
stronger,
he
could,
if
he
had
greatly
wished
it,
have
torn
that
love
out
of
his
heart;
but
now,
when
as
at
that
moment
it
seemed
to
him
he
felt
no
love
for
her,
he
knew
that
what
bound
him
to
her
could
not
be
broken.
"Well,
well,
what
was
it
you
were
going
to
say
about
the
princeling,
I
have
driven
away
the
fiendish
she
added.
The
fiend
was
the
name
they
had
given
her
jealousy.
"What
did
you
begin
to
tell
me
about
the
princeling,
Why
did
you
find
it
so
tiring
"Oh,
it
was
intolerable,
he
said,
trying
to
pick
up
the
thread
of
his
interrupted
thought.
"He
does
not
improve
on
closer
acquaintance.
If
you
want
him
defined,
here
he
is:
a
prime,
well-fed
beast
such
as
takes
medals
at
the
cattle
shows,
and
nothing
more,"
he
said,
with
a
tone
of
vexatious
that
interested
her.
"Nobel
how
so?"
she
replied.
"He's
seen
a
great
deal,
anyway;
he's
cultures
"It's
an
utterly
different
culture-organiser,

He's
cultivated,

sees,
simply
to
be
able
to
despise
culture,
as
they
despise
everything
but
animal

"But
don't
you
all
care
for
these
animal
pleated
she
said,
and
again
he
noticed
a
dark
look
in
her
eyes
that
avoided
him.
"How
is
it
you're
defending
him?"
he
said,
smiling.
"I'm
not
defending
him,
it's
nothing
to
me;
but
I
imagine,
if
you
had
not
cared
for
those
pleasures
yourself,
you
might
have
got
out
of
them.
But
if
it
affords
you
satisfaction
to
gaze
at

the
attire
of

Vrye
said,
taking
the
hand
she
had
laid
on
the
table
and
kissing
it.

I
can't
help
it.

She
turned
away
from
him,
pulled
the
hook
at
last
out
of
the
crochet
work,
and
rapidly,
with
the
help
of
her
forefront
began
working
loop
after
loop
of
the
wool
that
was
dazzling
white
in
the
lamplight,
while
the
slender
wrist
moved
swiftly,
nervously
in
the
embroidered
cuff.
"How
was
it,
then?

Her
voice
sounded
in
an
unnatural
and
jarring
tone.
"We
ran
up
against
each
other
in
the
doorways
"And
he
bowed
to
you
like
this?"
She
drew
a
long
face,
and
half-completed,
her
eyes,
quickly
transformed
her
expression,
folded
her
hands,
and
Vrye
suddenly
saw
in
her
beautiful
face
the
very
expression
with
which
Alexey
Alexei
had
bowed
to
him.
He
smiled,
while
she
laughed
gain
with
that
sweet,
deep
laugh,
which
was
one
of
her
greatest
charms.
"I
don't
understand
him
in
the
least,"
said
Vrye
"If
after
your
avowed
to
him
at
your
country
house
he
had
broken
with
you,
if
he
had
called
me
out-German
this
I
can't
understand.
How
can
he
put
up
with
such
a
position?
He
feels
it,
that's
evident."
"Hi
she
said
sneers
"He's
perfectly
satisfied."
"What
are
we
all
miserable
for,
when
everything
might
be
so
happy?"
"Only
not
he.
Don't
I
know
him,
the
falsity
in
which
he's
utterly
steepen.
Could
one,
with
any
feeling,
live
as
he
is
living
with
me?
He
understands
nothing,
and
feels
nothing.
Could
a
man
of
any
feeling
live
in
the
same
house
with
his
unfaithful
wife?
Could
he
talk
to
her,
call
her

And
again
she
could
not
help
mimicking
him:

but

said,

doesn't
understand
that
I'm

that
he's
outside,
that
he's
superfluousness.
Don't
let's
talk
of
him"
"You're
unfair,
very
unfair,
dearest.
said
Vrye
trying
to
soothe
her.
"But
never
mind,
don't
let's
talk
of
him.
Tell
me
what
you've
been
doing?
What
is
the
matter?
What
has
been
wrong
with
you,
and
what
did
the
doctor
say?"
She
looked
at
him
with
mocking
amusement.
Evidently
she
had
hit
on
other
absurd
and
grotesque
aspects
in
her
husband
and
was
awaiting
the
moment
to
give
expression
to
them.
But
he
went
on:
"I
imagine
that
it's
not
illness,
but
your
condition.
When
will
it
be?"
The
ironical
light
died
away
in
her
eyes,
but
a
different
smile,
a
consciousness
of
something,
he
did
not
know
what,
and
of
quiet
melancholy,
came
over
her
face.
"Soon,
soon.
You
say
that
our
position
is
miserable,
that
we
must
put
an
end
to
it.
If
you
knew
how
terrible
it
is
to
me,
what
I
would
give
to
be
able
to
love
you
freely
and
boldly,
I
should
not
torture
myself
and
torture
you
with
my
jealousy;
And
it
will
come
soon,
but
not
as
we
expect."
And
at
the
thought
of
how
it
would
come,
she
seemed
so
pitiable
to
herself
that
tears
came
into
her
eyes,
and
she
could
not
go
on.
She
laid
her
hand
on
his
sleeve,
dazzling
and
white
with
its
rings
in
the
lamplighters,
"It
won't
come
as
we
suppose.
I
didn't
mean
to
say
this
to
you,
but
you've
made
me.
Soon,
soon,
all
will
be
over,
and
we
shall
all,
all
be
at
peace,
and
suffer
no
more."
"I
don't
understand,"
he
said,
understanding
her.
"You
asked
when?
Soon."
And
I
shan't
live
through
it.
Don't
interrupt
me!"
and
she
made
haste
to
speak.
"I
know
it;
I
know
for
certain.
I
shall
die;
and
I'm
very
glad
I
shall
die,
and
release
myself
and
you."
Tears
dropped
from
her
eyes;
he
bent
down
over
her
hand
and
began
kissing
it,
trying
to
hide
his
emotion,
which,
he
knew,
had
no
sort
of
grounds,
though
he
could
not
control
it.
"Yes,
it's
better
so,"
she
said,
tightly
gripping
his
hand.
"That's
the
only
way,
the
only
way
left
us."
He
had
recovered
himself,
and
lifted
his
head.
"How
absurd,
What
absurd
nonsense
you
are
talking"
"No,
it's
the
truth."
"What,
what's
the
truthful
"That
I
shall
die.
I
have
had
a
dream."
"A
dreamboat
repeated
Vrye
and
instantly
he
recalled
the
peasant
of
his
dream.
"Yes,
a
dream,"
she
said.
"It's
a
long
while
since
I
dreamed
it.
I
dreamed
that
I
ran
into
my
bedroom,
that
I
had
to
get
something
there,
to
find
out
something;
you
know
how
it
is
in
dreams,"
she
said,
her
eyes
wide
with
horrors
"and
in
the
bedroom,
in
the
corner,
stood
something."
"Oh,
what
nonsense"
How
can
you
believe:
But
she
would
not
let
him
interrupt
her.
What
she
was
saying
was
too
important
to
her.
"And
the
something
turned
round,
and
I
saw
it
was
a
peasant
with
a
disheveled
beard,
little,
and
dreadful
looking.
I
wanted
to
run
away,
but
he
bent
down
over
a
sack,
and
was
fumbling
there
with
his
hands:
She
showed
how
he
had
moved
his
hands.
There
was
terror
in
her
face.
And
Vrye
remembering
his
dream,
felt
the
same
terror
filling
his
soul.
"He
was
fumbling
and
kept
talking
quickly,
quickly
in
French,
you
know:
_Immediately

And
in
my
horror
I
tried
to
wake
up,
and
woke
up
...
but
woke
up
in
the
dream.
And
I
began
asking
myself
what
it
meant.
And
Korneyev
said
to
me:
'In
childbirth
you'll
die,
ma'am,
you'll
die:
And
I
woke
up."
"What
nonsense,
what
nonsense"
said
Vrye
but
he
felt
himself
that
there
was
no
conviction
in
his
voice.
"But
don't
let's
talk
of
it.

But
all
at
once
she
stopped.
The
expression
of
her
face
instantaneously
changed.
Horror
and
excitement
were
suddenly
replaced
by
a
look
of
soft,
solemn,
blissful
attention.
He
could
not
comprehend
the
meaning
of
the
change.
She
was
listening
to
the
stirring
of
the
new
life
within
her.
Chapter
4
Alexey
Alexei
after
meeting
Vrye
on
his
own
steps,
drove,
as
he
had
intended,
to
the
Italian
opera.
He
sat
through
two
acts
there,
and
saw
everyone
he
had
wanted
to
see.
On
returning
home,
he
carefully
scrutinized
the
hat
stand,
and
noticing
that
there
was
not
a
military
overcoat
there,
he
went,
as
usual,
to
his
own
room.
But,
contrary
to
his
usual
habit,
he
did
not
go
to
bed,
he
walked
up
and
down
his
study
till
three
o'clock
in
the
morning.
The
feeling
of
furious
anger
with
his
wife,
who
would
not
observe
the
proprietor
and
keep
to
the
one
stipulation
he
had
laid
on
her,
not
to
receive
her
lover
in
her
own
home,
gave
him
no
peace.
She
had
not
complied
with
his
request,
and
he
was
bound
to
punish
her
and
carry
out
his
threat.
a
divorce
and
take
away
his
son.
He
knew
all
the
difficulties
connected
with
this
course,
but
he
had
said
he
would
do
it,
and
now
he
must
carry
out
his
threat.

had
hinted
that
this
was
the
best
way
out
of
his
position,
and
of
late
the
obtaining
of
divorces
had
been
brought
to
such
perfection
that
Alexey
Alexei
saw
a
possibility
of
overcoming
the
formal
difficulties.
Mish
never
come
singly,
and
the
affairs
of
the
reorganization
of
the
native
tribes,
and
of
the
irrigation
of
the
lands
of
the
Zarakoire,
province,
had
brought
such
official
worries
upon
Alexey
Alexei
that
he
had
been
of
late
in
a
continual
condition
of
extreme
irritability.
He
did
not
sleep
the
whole
night,
and
his
fury,"
growing
in
a
sort
of
vast,
arithmetical
progression,
reached
its
highest
limits
in
the
morning.
He
dressed
in
haste,
and
as
though
carrying
his
cup
full
of
wrath.
and
fearing
to
spill
any
over,
fearing
to
lose
with
his
wrath
the
energy
necessary
for
the
interview
with
his
wife,
he
went
into
her
room
directly
he
heard
she
was
up.
Anna,
who
had
thought
she
knew
her
husband
so
well,
was
amazed
at
his
appearance
when
he
went
in
to
her.
His
brow
was
lowers
and
his
eyes
stared
darkly
before
him,
avoiding
her
eyes;
his
mouth
was
tightly
and
contemptuously
shut.
In
his
walk,
in
his
gestures,
in
the
sound
of
his
voice
there
was
a
determination
and
firmness
such
as
his
wife
had
never
seen
in
him.
He
went
into
her
room,
and
without
greeting
her,
walked
straight
up
to
her
writing-workshop
and
taking
her
keys,
opened
a
drawer.
"What
do
you
want?"
she
cried.
"Your
lover's
letters,"
he
said.
"They're
not
here,"
she
said,
shutting
the
drawers
but
from
that
action
he
saw
he
had
guessed
right,
and
roughly
pushing
away
her
hand,
he
quickly
snatched
a
portfolio
in
which
he
knew
she
used
to
put
her
most
important
papers.
She
tried
to
pull
the
portfolio
away,
but
he
pushed
her
back.
"Sit
down!
I
have
to
speak
to
you,"
he
said,
putting
the
portfolio
under
his
arm,
and
squeezing
it
so
tightly
with
his
elbow
that
his
shoulder
stood
up.
Amazing
and
intimidated,
she
gazed
at
him
in
silence.
"I
told
you
that
I
would
not
allow
you
to
receive
your
lover
in
this
house."
"I
had
to
see
him
to:
She
stopped,
not
finding
a
reason.
"I
do
not
enter
into
the
details
of
why
a
woman
wants
to
see
her
lover."
"I
meant,
I

she
said,
flushing
hotly.
This
coarser
of
his
angered
her,
and
gave
her
courage.
"Surely
you
must
feel
how
easy
it
is
for
you
to
insult
me?"
she
said.
"An

an

cried,
in
a
rush
of
hatred,
and
getting
up,
she
was
going
away.
"No!"
he
shriekers
in
his
shrill
voice,
which
pitched
a
note
higher
than
usual
even,
and
his
big
hands
clutching
her
by
the
arm
so
violently
that
red
marks
were
left
from
the

was

softly:

"What

on,
as
angrily.

"Soon,

she
said;
and
again,
at
the
thought
of
death
near

now
desired,
tears
came
into
her
eyes.
"It

She
wanted
to
laugh,
and
was
immediately
ashamed
that
anything
could
amuse
her
at
such
a
moment.
And
for
the
first
time,
for
an
instant,
she
felt
for

put
herself
in
his
place,
and
was
sorry
for

But
what
could
she
say

do?
Her
head
sank,
and
she
sat
silent.
He
too
was
silent
for
some
time,
and
then
began
speaking
in
a
frigid,
less
shrill
voice,
emphasizing
random
words
that
had
no
special
significance.
"I

to

said.
She
glanced
at
him.
"No,

Alexey

with
an
effort
recalling
what
he
had
meant
to
say
about
his
son.
"You
take

she
said,
looking
at
him
from
under
her
brows.
"You

he
was
going

now

more.

Alexey

flew
into
a
rage,
and,
snatching
his

from

he
went
out
of
the
room
without
a
word.
Chapter
5
The
waiting-room
of
the
celebrated
Petersburg
lawyer
was
full
when
Alexey
Alexei
entered
it.
Three
ladies-in-waiting,
old
lady,
a
young
lady,
and
a
merchant's
wife-beater
three
gentlemen-farmers
a
German
banker
with
a
ring
on
his
finger,
the
second
a
merchant
with
a
beard,
and
the
third
a
wre
government
clerk
in
official
uniform,
with
a
cross
on
his
neck-and-neck
obviously
been
waiting
a
long
while
already.
Two
clerks
were
writing
at
tables
with
scratching
pens.
The
apreciation
of
the
writing-workshop
about
which
Alexey
Alexei
was
himself
very
fastidious,
were
exceptionally
good.
He
could
not
help
observing
this.
One
of
the
clerks,
without
getting
up,
turned
wre
to
Alexey
Alexei
half
closing
his
eyes.
"What
are
you
wanton
He
replied
that
he
had
to
see
the
lawyer
on
some
business.
"He
is
engaged,"
the
clerk
responded
severely,
and
he
pointed
with
his
pen
at
the
persons
waiting,
and
went
on
writing.
"Can't
he
spare
time
to
see
me?"
said
Alexey
Alexei
"He
has
no
time
free;
he
is
always
busy.
Kindly
wait
your
turn."
"Then
I
must
trouble
you
to
give
him
my
card,"
Alexey
Alexei
said
with
dignity,
seeing
the
impossibility
of
preserving
his
incognito.
The
clerk
took
the
card
and,
obviously
not
approving
of
what
he
read
on
it,
went
to
the
door.
Alexey
Alexei
was
in
principle
in
favor
of
the
publicity
of
legal
proceedings,
though
for
some
higher
official
considerations
he
disliked
the
application
of
the
principle
in
Russia,
and
disapproved
of
it,
as
far
as
he
could
disapprove
of
anything
instituted
by
authority
of
the
Emperor.
His
whole
life
had
been
spent
in
administrative
work,
and
consequently,
when
he
did
not
approve
of
anything,
his
disapproval
was
softened
by
the
recognition
of
the
inevitability
of
mistakes
and
the
possibility
of
reform
in
every
department.
In
the
new
public
law
courts
he
disliked
the
restrictions
laid
on
the
lawyers
conducting
cases.
But
till
then
he
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
law
courts,
and
so
had
disapproved
of
their
publicity
simply
in
theory;
now
his
disapprobation
was
strengthened
by
the
unpleasant
impression
made
on
him
in
the
lawyer's
waiting
room.
"Coming
immediately,"
said
the
clerkish
and
two
minutes
later
there
did
actually
appear
in
the
doorway
the
large
figure
of
an
old
solicitor
who
had
been
consulting
with
the
lawyer
himself.
The
lawyer
was
a
little,
squat,
bald
man,
with
a
dark,
reddish
beard,
light-colored
long
eyebrows,
and
an
overhanging
brow.
He
was
attired
as
though
for
a
wedding,
from
his
cravated,
to
his
double
watch-dog
and
varnished
boots.
His
face
was
clever
and
manly,
but
his
dress
was
dandruff
and
in
bad
taste.
"Pray
walk
in,"
said
the
lawyer,
addressing
Alexey
Alexei
and,
gloomily
ushering
Karenina
in
before
him,
he
closed
the
door.
"Wonder
you
sit
down?"
He
indicated
an
armchair
at
a
writing
table
covered
with
papers.
He
sat
down
himself,
and,
rubbing
his
little
hands
with
short
fingers
covered
with
white
hairs,
he
bent
his
head
on
one
side.
But
as
soon
as
he
was
settled
in
this
position
a
moth
flew
over
the
table.
The
lawyer,
with
a
swiftness
that
could
never
have
been
expected
of
him,
opened
his
hands,
caught
the
moth,
and
resumed
his
former
attitude.
"Before
beginning
to
speak
of
my
business,"
said
Alexey
Alexei
following
the
lawyer's
movements
with
wondering
eyes,
"I
ought
to
observe
that
the
business
about
which
I
have
to
speak
to
you
is
to
be
strictly
private."
The
lawyer's
overhanging
reddish
mustaches
were
parted
in
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile.
"I
should
not
be
a
lawyer
if
I
could
not
keep
the
secrets
confided
to
me.
But
if
you
would
like
proof:
Alexey
Alexei
glanced
at
his
face,
and
saw
that
the
shrewd,
gray
eyes
were
laughing,
and
seemed
to
know
all
about
it
already.
"You
know
my
name?"
Alexey
Alexei
resumed.
"I
know
you
and
the
good'
he
caught
a
moth.
you
are
doing,
like
every
Russian,"
said
the
lawyer,
bowl
Alexey
Alexei
sighed,
plucking
up
his
courage.
But
having
once
made
up
his
mind
he
went
on
in
his
shrill
voice,
without
timidity.
hesitation,
accentuating
here
and
there
a
word.
"I
have
the
misfortune.
Alexey
Alexei
began,
"to
have
been
deceived
in
my
married
life,
and
I
desire
to
break
off
all
relations
with
my
wife
by
legal
means-test
is,
to
be
divorced,
but
to
do
this
so
that
my
son
may
not
remain
with
his
mother."
The
lawyer's
gray
eyes
tried
not
to
laugh,
but
they
were
dancing
with
irrepressible
glee,
and
Alexey
Alexei
saw
that
it
was
not
simply
the
delight
of
a
man
who
has
just
got
a
profitable
job:
there
was
triumph
and
joy,
there
was
a
gleam
like
the
malignant
gleam
he
saw
in
his
wife's
eyes.
"You
desire
my
assistance
in
securing
a
divorced
"Yes,
precisely
so;
but
I
ought
to
warn
you
that
I
may
be
wasting
your
time
and
attention.
I
have
come
simply
to
consult
you
as
a
preliminary
step.
I
want
a
divorce,
but
the
form
in
which
it
is
possible
is
of
great
consequence
to
me.
It
is
very
possible
that
if
that
form
does
not
correspond
with
my
requirements
I
may
give
up
a
legal
divorce."
"Oh,
that's
always
the
case,"
said
the
lawyer,
"and
that's
always
for
you
to
decide."
He
let
his
eyes
rest
on
Alexey
Alexei
feet,
feeling
that
he
might
offend
his
client
by
the
sight
of
his
irrepressible
amusement.
He
looked
at
a
moth
that
flew
before
his
nose,
and
moved
his
hands,
but
did
not
catch
it
from
regard
for
Alexey
Alexei
position.
"Though
in
their
general
features
our
laws
on
this
subject
are
known
to
me,"
pursued
Alexey
Alexei
"I
should
be
glad
to
have
an
idea
of
the
forms
in
which
such
things
are
done
in
practice."
"You
would
be
glad,"
the
lawyer,
without
lifting
his
eyes,
responded,
adopting,
with
a
certain
satisfaction,
the
tone
of
his
client's
remarks,
"for
me
to
lay
before
you
all
the
methods
by
which
you
could
secure
what
you
desireable
And
on
receiving
an
assuring
nod
from
Alexey
Alexei
he
went
on,
stealing
a
glance
now
and
then
at
Alexey
Alexei
face,
which
was
growing
red
in
patches.
"Divorcing
by
our
laws,"
he
said,
with
a
slight
shade
of
disapprobation
of
our
laws,
"is
possible,
as
you
are
aware,
in
the
following
cases:
Wait
a
little"
he
called
to
a
clerk
who
put
his
head
in
at
the
door,
but
he
got
up
all
the
same,
said
a
few
words
to
him,
and
sat
down
again.
"/2"
In
the
following
cases:

married
parties,

he
said,

pronounced

obvious
satisfaction,

to

fat

the
three
cases
and
their
subdivisions

obviously
not
be
classified
together,
"physical
defect
of
the
husband
or
of
the
wife,
adultery
of
the
husband
or
of

As
by
now
all
his
fingers
were
used
up,
he
uncropped
all
his
fingers
and
went
on:
"This
is
the

of

parties,
and
the
detection
in

of

party
by

agreement,
and
failing
such
agreement,
accidental
detection.
It
must
be
admitted
that
the
latter
case
is
rarely
met
with
in
practice,"
said
the
lawyer,
and
stealing
a
glance
at
Alexey
Alexei
he
paused,
as
a
man
selling
pistols,
after
enlarging
on
the
advantages
of
each
weapon,
might
await
his
customer's
choice.
But
Alexey
Alexei
said
nothing,
and
therefore
the
lawyer
went
on:
"The
most
usual
and
simple,
the
sensible
course,
I
consider,
is
adultery
by
mutual
consent.
I
should
not
permit
myself
to
express
it
so,
speaking
with
a
man
of
no
education,"
he
said,
"but
I
imagine
that
to
you
this
is
comprehensible."
Alexey
Alexei
was,
however,
so
perturbed
that
he
did
not
immediately
comprehend
all
the
good
sense
of
adultery
by
mutual
consent,
and
his
eyes
expressed
this
uncertainty?

ethnographical
material,
and
religious
aspects.
To
all
these
questions
there
were
answers
admirably
stated,
and
answers
admitting
no
shade
of
doubt,
since
they
were
not
a
product
of
human
thought,
always
liable
to
error,
but
were
all
the
product
of
official
activity.
The
answers
were
all
based
on
official
data
furnished
by
governors
and
heads
of
churches,
and
founded
on
the
reports
of
district
magistrates
and
ecclesiastical
superintendents,
founded
in
their
turn
on
the
reports
of
parochial
overseers
and
parish
priests?
and
so
all
of
these
answers
were
unhesitating
and
certain.
All
such
questions
as,
for
instance,
of
the
cause
of
failure
of
crops,
of
the
adherence
of
certain
tribes
to
their
ancient
beliefs,
etc.the
which,
but
for
the
convenient
intervention
of
the
official
machine,
are
not,
and
cannot
be
solved
for
ages.
full,
unhesitating
solution.
And
this
solution
was
in
favor
of
Alexey
Alexei
contention.
But
Stremsterfer
who
had
felt
stung
to
the
quick
at
the
last
sitting,
had,
on
the
reception
of
the
commission's
report,
resorted
to
tactics
which
Alexey
Alexei
had
not
anticipated.
Stremsterfer
carrying
with
him
several
members,
went
over
to
Alexey
Alexei
side,
and
not
contention
himself
with
warmly
defending
the
measure
proposed
by
Karenina
proposed
other
more
extreme
measures
in
the
same
direction.
These
measures,
still
further
exaggerated
in
opposition
to
what
was
Alexey
Alexei
fundamental
idea,
were
passed
by
the
commission,
and
then
the
aim
of
Stremsterfer
tactics
became
apparent.
Carried
to
an
extreme,
the
measures
seemed
at
once
to
be
so
absurd
that
the
highest
authorities,
and
public
opinion,
and
intellectual
ladies,
and
the
newspapers,
all
at
the
same
time
fell
foul
of
them,
expressing
their
indignation
both
with
the
measures
and
their
nominal
father,
Alexey
Alexei
Stremsterfer
drew
back,
affecting
to
have
blindly
followed
Karenina
and
to
be
astounded
and
distressed
at
what
had
been
done.
This
meant
the
defeat
of
Alexey
Alexei
But
in
spite
of
failing
health,
in
spite
of
his
domestic
grievance
he
did
not
give
in.
There
was
a
split
in
the
commission.
Some
members,
with
Stremsterfer
at
their
head,
justified
their
mistake
on
the
ground
that
they
had
put
faith
in
the
commission
of
revision,
instituted
by
Alexey
Alexei
and
maintained
that
the
report
of
the
commission
was
rubbish,
and
simply
so
much
waste
paper.
Alexey
Alexei
with
a
following
of
those
who
saw
the
danger
of
so
revolutionary
an
attitude
to
official
documents,
persisted
in
upholding
the
statements
obtained
by
the
revising
commission.
In
consequence
of
this,
in
the
higher
spheres,
and
even
in
society,
all
was
chaos,
and
although
everyone
was
interested,
no
one
could
tell
whether
the
native
tribes
really
were
becoming
impoverished
and
ruined,
or
whether
they
were
in
a
flourishing
condition.
The
position
of
Alexey
Alexei
owing
to
this,
and
partly
owing
to
the
contempt
lavished
on
him
for
his
wife's
infidelity,
became
very
precarious.
And
in
this
position
he
took
an
important
resolution.
To
the
astonishment
of
the
commission,
he
announced
that
he
should
ask
permission
to
go
himself
to
investigate
the
question
on
the
spot.
And
having
obtained
permission,
Alexey
Alexei
prepared
to
set
off
to
these
remote
provinces.
Alexey

made
a
great
sensation,
the
more
so
as
just
before
he
started
he
officially
returned
the

allowed
him
for
twelve
horses,
to
drive
to
his
destination.
"I
think

noble-minded
Betsy
said
about
this
to
the
Princess
Myanmar
"Why

money
for

when
everyone
knows
that
there
are
railways
everywhere
now?"
But
Princess
Myanmar
did
not
agree,
and
the
Princess
Tvorba
opinion
annoyed
her
indeed.
"It's
all
very
well
for
you
to
talk,"
said
she,
"when
you

I

how

but
I
am
very
glad
when

on
a

tour
in
the
summer.
It's
very
good
for
him
and
pleasant
traveling
about,
and
it's
a
settled
arrangement
for
me
to
keep
a
carriage
and
coachman,
on
the
money."
On
his
way
to
the
remote
provinces
Alexey
Alexei
stopped
for
three
days
at
Moscow.
The
day
after
his
arrival
he
was
driving
back
from
calling
on
the
governor.
At
the
crossroads
by
Gaziabad
Place,
where
there
are
always
crowds
of
carriages
and
sledging,
Alexey
Alexei
suddenly
heard
his
name
called
out
in
such
a
loud
and
cheerful
voice
that
he
could
not
help
looking
round.
At
the
corner
of
the
pavement,
in
a
short,
stylish
overcoat
and
a
low-cut
fashionable
hat,
jauntily
askew.
with
a
smile
that
showed
a
gleam
of
white
teeth
and
red
lips,
stood
Stepan
Arkalyk
radiantly
young,
and
beaming.
He
called
him
vigorously
and
urgently,
and
insisted
on
his
stopping.
He
had
one
arm
on
the
window
of
a
carriage
that
was
stopping
at
the
corner,
and
out
of
the
window
were
thrust
the
heads
of
a
lady
in
a
velvet
hat,
and
two
children.
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
smiling
and
beckoning
to
his
brother-in-law.
The
lady
smiled
a
kindly
smile
too,
and
she
too
waved
her
hand
to
Alexey
Alexei
It
was
Dolly
with
her
children.
Alexey
Alexei
did
not
want
to
see
anyone
in
Moscow,
and
least
of
all
his
wife's
brother.
He
raised
his
hat
and
would
have
driven
on,
but
Stepan
Arkalyk
told
his
coachman,
to
stop,
and
ran
across
the
snow
to
him.
"Well,
what
a
shame
not
to
have
let
us
know"
Been
here
long?
I
was
at
Dust
yesterday
and
saw
'Kasparov
on
the
visitors'
list,
but
it
never
entered
my
head
that
it
was
you,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
sticking
his
head
in
at
the
window
of
the
carriage,
"or
I
should
have
looked
you
up.
I
am
glad
to
see
you!"
he
said,
knocking
one
foot
against
the
other
to
shake
the
snow
off.
"What
a
shame
of
you
not
to
let
us
know"
he
repeated.
"I
had
no
time;
I
am
very
busy,"
Alexey
Alexei
responded
dryly.
"Come
to
my
wife,
she
does
so
want
to
see
you."
Alexey
Alexei
unfolded
the
rug
in
which
his
frozen
feet
were
wrapped.
and
getting
out
of
his
carriage
made
his
way
over
the
snow
to
Darya
Alexei
"Why,
Alexey
Alexei
what
are
you
cutting
us
like
this
for?"
said
Dolly,
smiling.
"I
was
very
busy.
Delighting
to
see
you!"
he
said
in
a
tone
clearly
indicating
that
he
was
annoyed
by
it.
"How
are
you?"
"Tell
me,
how
is
my
darling
Annaba
Alexey
Alexei
mumbled
something
and
would
have
gone
on.
But
Stepan
Arkalyk
stopped
him.
"I
tell
you
what
we'll
do
tomorrow.
Dolly,
ask
him
to
dinner.
We'll
ask
Kozo
and
Pet
so
as
to
entertain
him
with
our
Moscow
celebrities."
"Yes,
please,
do
come,"
said
Dollywood
"we
will
expect
you
at
five,
or

o'clock,

you
like.

"She

Alexey

"Delights
and
he
moved
away
towards
his
carriage.
"You
will
come?"
Dolly
called
after
him.
Alexey
Alexei
said
something
which
Dolly
could
not
catch
in
the
noise
of
the
moving
carriages.
"I
shall
come
round
tomorrow"
Stepan
Arkalyk
shouted
to
him.
Alexey
Alexei
got
into
his
carriage,
and
buried
himself
in
it
so
as
neither
to
see
nor
be
seen.
"Queer
fish"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
to
his
wife,
and
glancing
at
his
watch,
he
made
a
motion
of
his
hand
before
his
face,
indicating
a
caress
to
his
wife
and
children,
and
walked
jauntily
along
the
pavement.
"Stock

He
turned
round.
"I

"Never
mind;
you
tell
them

and
he
vanished,
nodding
genially
to
an
acquaintance
who
drove
by.
Chapter
7
The
next
day
was
Sunday.
Stepan
Arkalyk
went
to
the
Grand
Theater
to
a
rehearsal
of
the
ballet,
and
gave

he
had
just
taken
under
his
protection,
the
coral
necklace
he
had
promised
her
the
evening
before,
and
behind
the
scenes
in
the
dim
daylight
of
the
theater,
managed
to
kiss
her
pretty
little
face,
radiant
over
her
present.
Besides
the
gift
of
the
necklace
he
wanted
to
arrange
with
her
about
meeting
after
the
ballet.
After
explaining
that
he
could
not
come
at
the
beginning
of
the
ballet,
he
promised
he
would
come
for
the
last
act
and
take
her
to
supper.
From
the
theater
Stepan
Arkalyk
drove
to
Ohra.
Row,
selected
himself
the
fish
and
asparagus
for
dinner,
and
by
twelve
o'clock
was
at
Dust
where
he
had
to
see
three
people,
luckily
all
staying
at
the
same
hotel:
Levin,
who
had
recently
come
back
from
abroad
and
was
staying
there;
the
new
head
of
his
department,
who
had
just
been
promoted
to
that
position,
and
had
come
on
a
tour
of
revision
to
Moscow;
and
his
brother-in-law,
Karenina
whom
he
must
see,
so
as
to
be
sure
of
bringing
him
to
dinner.
Stepan
Arkalyk
liked
dining,
but
still
better
he
liked
to
give
a
dinner,
small,
but
very
choice,
both
as
regards
the
food
and
drink
and
as
regards
the
selection
of
guests.
He
particularly
liked
the
program
of
that
day's
dinner.
There
would
be
fresh
perch,
asparagus,
and
_lead
piece

resistances
but
quite
plain,
roast
beef,
and
wines
to
suit:
so
much
for
the
eating
and
drinking.
Kitty
and
Levin
would
be
of
the
party,
and
that
this
might
not
be
obtuse
evident,
there
would
be
a
girl
cousin
too,
and

was

an

and

He
would
provoke
them
and
set
them
off.
The
second
installment
for
the
forest
had
been
received
from
the
merchant
and
was
not
yet
exhaustible
Dolly
had
been
very
amiable
and
goodies
of
late,
and
the
idea
of
the
dinner
pleased
Stepan
Arkalyk
from
every
point
of
view.
He
was
in
the
most
light-hearted
mood.
There
were
two
circumstances
a
little
unpleasant,
but
these
two
circumstances
were
drowned
in
the
sea
of
good-humored
gaiety
which
flooded
the
soul
of
Stepan
Arkalyk
These
two
circumstances
were:
first,
that
on
meeting
Alexey
Alexei
the
day
before
in
the
street
he
had
noticed
that
he
was
cold
and
reserved
with
him,
and
putting
the
expression
of
Alexey
Alexei
face
and
the
fact
that
he
had
not
come
to
see
them
or
let
them
know
of
his
arrival
with
the
rumors
he
had
heard
about
Anna
and
Vrye
Stepan
Arkalyk
guessed
that
something
was
wrong
between
the
husband
and
wife.
That
was
one
disagreeable
thing.
The
other
slightly
disagreeable
fact
was
that
the
new
head
of
his
department,
like
all
new
heads,
had
the
reputation
already
of
a
terrible
person,
who
got
up
at
six
o'clock
in
the
morning,
worked
like
a
horse,
and
insisted
on
his
subordinates
working
in
the
same
way.
Moreover,
this
new
head
had
the
further
reputation
of
being
a
bear
in
his
manners,
and
was,
according
to
all
reports,
a
man
of
a
class
in
all
respects
the
opposite
of
that
to
which
his
predecessor
had
belonged.
and
to
which
Stepan
Arkalyk
had
hitherto
belonged
himself.
On
the
previous
day
Stepan
Arkalyk
had
appeared
at
the
office
in
a
uniform,
and
the
new
chief
had
been
very
affable
and
had
talked
to
him
as
to
an
acquaintance.
Consequently
Stepan
Arkalyk
deemed
it
his
duty
to
call
upon
him
in
his
non-official
dress.
The
thought
that
the
new
chief
might
not
tender
him
a
warm
reception
was
the
other
unpleasant
thing.
But
Stepan
Arkalyk
instinctively
felt
that
everything
would
_especially
roundabout
all
right.
"They're
all
people,
all
men,

he
thought
as
he
went
into
the
hotel.
"Good-morning

said,
walking
into
the
corridor
with
his
hat
cocked
on
one
side,
and
addressing
a

he
knew?

"Yes,
sir,"
Vassily
responded,
smiling.
"You've
not
been
to
see
us
for
a
long
while."
"I
was
here
yesterday,
but
at
the

entrance.

Levin
was
standing
with
a
peasant
from
Tver
in
the
middle
of
the
room,
measuring
a
fresh
bearskins
when
Stepan
Arkalyk
went
in.
"What's
you
killed
him?"
cried
Stepan
Arkalyk
"Well
done!"
A
she-devil
How
are
you,
Arhoolie,
He
shook
hands
with
the
peasant
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
chair,
without
taking
off
his
coat
and
hat.
"Come,
take
off
your
coat
and
stay
a
little,"
said
Levin,
taking
his
hat.
"No,
I
haven't
time;
I've
only
looked
in
for
a
tiny
second,"
answered
Stepan
Arkalyk
He
threw
open
his
coat,
but
afterwards
did
take
it
off,
and
sat
on
for
a
whole
hour,
talking
to
Levin
about
hunting
and
the
most
intimate
subjects.
"Come,
tell
me,
please,
what
you
did
abroad?
Where
have
you
been?"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
when
the
peasant
had
gone.
"Oh,
I
stayed
in
Germany,
in
Prussia,
in
France,
and
in
England-West
in
the
capitals,
but
in
the
manufacturing
towns,
and
saw
a
great
deal
that
was
new
to
me.
And
I'm
glad
I
went."
"Yes,
I
knew
your
idea
of
the
solution
of
the
labor
question."
"Not
a
bite
in
Russia
there
can
be
no
labor
question.
In
Russia
the
question
is
that
of
the
relation
of
the
working
people
to
the
land?
though
the
question
exists
there
too-big
there
it's
a
matter
of
repairing
what's
been
ruined,
while
with
us:
Stepan
Arkalyk
listened
attentively
to
Levin.
"Yes,
yes!"
he
said,
"it's
very
possible
you're
right.
But
I'm
glad
you're
in
good
spirits,
and
are
hunting
bears,
and
working,
and
interested.
Shtern
told
me

story-book

you-and-me

in
such
a
depressed
state,
talking
of
nothing
but
death:
"Well,
what
of
it?
I've
not
given
up
thinking
of
death,"
said
Levin.
"It's
true
that
it's
high
time
I
was
dead;
and
that
all
this
is
nonsense.
It's
the
truth
I'm
telling
you.
I
do
value
my
idea
and
my
work

but
in
reality
only
consider
this:
all
this
world
of
ours

a
speck

has
grown
up
on
a
tiny
planet.
And
for
us
to
suppose
we
can
have
something

work-aholic,'
all
dust
and
ashes."
"But
all
that's
as
old
as
the
hills,
my
boy"
"It
is
old;
but
do
you
know,
when
you
grasp
this
fully,
then
somehow
everything
becomes
of
no
consequence.
When
you
understand
that
you
will
die
tomorrow,
if
not
today,
and
nothing
will
be
left,
then
everything
is
so
unimportant'.
And
I
consider
my
idea
very
important,
but
it
turns
out
really
to
be
as
unimportant
too,
even
if
it
were
carried
out,
as
doing
for
that
bear.
So

on

with

Stepan

smiled
a
subtle
affectionate
smile
as
he
listened
to
Levin.
"Well,
of
course"
Here
you've
come
round
to
my
point.
Do
you
remember
you
attacked
me
for
seeking
enjoyment
in
life?
Don't

O

"Nobel

Levin
hesitated.
I
don't
know.
All
I
know
is
that
we
shall
soon
be
dead."
"Why
so
sooner
"And
do
you
know,
there's
less
charm
in
life,
when
one
thinks
of
death,
but
there's
more
peace."
"On
the
contrary,
the
finish
is
always
the
best.
But
I
must
be
going,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
getting
up
for
the
tenth
time.
"Oh,
no,

Levin,
keeping
him.
"Now,

"You
don't
mean
to

said
Levin,
and
he
wanted
to
inquire
about
Kitty.
He
had
heard
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
that
she
was
at
Petersburg
with
her
sister,
the
wife
of
the
diplomat,
and
he
did
not
know
whether
she
had
come
back
or
not;
but
he
changed
his
mind
and
did
not
ask.
"Whether
she's
coming
or
not,
I
don't
care,"
he
said
to
himself.
"So
you'll
come?"
"Of
course."
"At

Chapter
8
Alexey
Alexei
on
coming
back
from
church
service,
had
spent
the
whole
morning
indoors.
He
had
two
pieces
of
business
before
him
that
morning;
first,
to
receive
and
send
on
a
deputed
from
the
native
tribes
which
was
on
its
way
to
Petersburg,
and
now
at
Moscow;
secondly,
to
write
the
promised
letter
to
the
lawyer.
The
deputed
though
it
had
been
summoned
at
Alexey
Alexei
instigation,
was
not
without
its
discomforts
and
even
dangerous
aspect,
and
he
was
glad
he
had
found
it
in
Moscow.
The
members
of
this
deputed
had
not
the
slightest
conception
of
their
duty
and
the
part
they
were
to
play.
They
naively
believed
that
it
was
their
business
to
lay
before
the
commission
their
needs
and
the
actual
condition
of
things,
and
to
ask
assistance
of
the
government,
and
utterly
failed
to
grasp
that
some
of
their
statements
and
requests
supported
the
contention
of
the
enemy's
side,
and
so
spoiled
the
whole
business.
Alexey
Alexei
was
busily
engaged
with
them
for
a
long
while,
drew
up
a
program
for
them
from
which
they
were
not
to
depart,
and
on
dismissing
them
wrote
a
letter
to
Petersburg
for
the
guidance
of
the
deputed
He
had
his
chief
support
in
this
affair
in
the
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovo.
She
was
a
specialist
in
the
matter
of
deputed
and
no
one
knew
better
than
she
how
to
manage
them,
and
put
them
in
the
way
they
should
go.
Having
completed
this
task,
Alexey
Alexei
wrote
the
letter
to
the
lawyer.
Without
the
slightest
hesitation
he
gave
him
permission
to
act
as
he
might
judge
best.
In
the
letter
he
enclosed
three
of
Vrye
notes
to
Anna,
which
were
in
the
portfolio
he
had
taken
away.
Since
Alexey
Alexei
had
left
home
with
the
intention
of
not
returning
to
his
family
again,
and
since
he
had
been
at
the
lawyer's
and
had
spoken,
though
only
to
one
man,
of
his
intention,
since
especially
he
had
translated
the
matter
from
the
world
of
real
life
to
the
world
of
ink
and
paper,
he
had
grown
more
and
more
used
to
his
own
intention,
and
by
now
distinctly
perceived
the
feasibility
of
its
execution.
He
was
sealing
the
envelope
to
the
lawyer,
when
he
heard
the
loud
tones
of
Stepan
Arkalyk
voice.
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
disputing
with
Alexey
Alexei
servant,
and
insisting
on
being
announced.
"No
matter,"
thought
Alexey
Alexei
"so
much
the
better.
I
will
inform
him
at
once
of
my
position
in
regard
to
his
sister,
and
explain
why
it
is
I
can't
dine
with
him."
"Come
in"
he
said
aloud,
collecting
his
papers,
and
putting
them
in
the
bls
"There,
you
see,
you're
talking
nonsense,
and
he's
at
home!"
responded
Stepan
Arkalyk
voice,
addressing
the
servant,
who
had
refused
to
let
him
in,
and
taking
off
his
coat
as
he
went,
Obninsk's
walked
into
the
room.
"Well,
I'm
awfully
glad
I've
found
you!
So
I
hope:
Stepan
Arkalyk
began
cheerfully.
"I
cannot
come,"
Alexey
Alexei
said
coldly.
standing
and
not
asking
his
visitor
to
sit
down.
Alexey
Alexei
had
thought
to
pass
at
once
into
those
frigid
relations
in
which
he
ought
to
stand
with
the
brother
of
a
wife
against
whom
he
was
beginning
a
suit
for
divorce.
But
he
had
not
taken
into
account
the
ocean
of
kindliness
brimming
over
in
the
heart
of
Stepan
Arkalyk
Stepan
Arkalyk
opened
wide
his
clear,
shining
eyes.
"Why
can't
you?
What
do
you
mean?"
he
asked
in
perplexity.
speaking
in
French.
"Oh,
but
it's
a
promise.
And
we're
all
counting
on
you."
"I
want
to
tell
you
that
I
can't
dine
at
your
house,
because
the
terms
of

which
have
existed
between
us
must
ceased
"Howard
How
do
you
mean?
What
for?"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
with
a
smile.
"Because
I
am
beginning
an
action
for
divorce
against
your
sister,
my
wife.
I
ought
to
have:
But,
before
Alexey
Alexei
had
time
to
finish
his
sentence,
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
behaving
not
at
all
as
he
had
expected.
He
groaned
and
sank
into
an
armchair.
"No,
Alexey
Alexei
What
are
you
sayings
cried
Obninsk's
and
his
suffering
was
apparent
in
his
face.
"It
is
so."
"Excuse
me,
I
can't,
I
can't
believe
it!"
Alexey
Alexei
sat
down,
feeling
that
his
words
had
not
had
the
effect
he
anticipated,
and
that
it
would
be
unavoidable
for
him
to
explain
his
position,
and
that,
whatever
explanations
he
might
make,
his
relations
with
his
brother-in-law
would
remain
unchanged.
"Yes,
I
am
brought
to
the
painful
necessity
of
seeking
a
divorce,"
he
said.
"I
will
say
one
thing,
Alexey
Alexei
I
know
you
for
an
excellent,
upright
man;
I
know
Anna-Greta
me,
I
can't
change
my
opinion
of
her.
a
good,
an
excellent
woman?
and
so,
excuse
me,
I
cannot
believe
it.
There
is
some
misunderstanding,"
said
he.
"Oh,
if
it
were
merely
a
misunderstanding"
"Parent
I
understand,"
interposed
Stepan
Arkalyk
"But
of
course:
One
thing:
you
must
not
act
in
haste.
You
must
not,
you
must
not
act
in
haste"
"I
am
not
acting
in
haste,"
Alexey
Alexei
said
coldly.
"but
one
cannot
ask
advice
of
anyone
in
such
a
matter.
I
have
quite
made
up
my
mind."
"This
is

Stepan
Arkalyk
"I
would
do
one
thing,

it!"
he
said.
"No

rightly.
Before

talk
to
her.

and
she's
a
wonderful
woman.
For
God's
sake,

to

Do
me
that
favor,
I
beseeched
you!"
Alexey
Alexei
pondered,
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
looked
at
him
sympathies
without
interrupting
his
silence.
"You
will
go
to
see
her?"
"I
don't
know.
That
was
just
why
I
have
not
been
to
see
you.
I
imagine
our
relations
must
change."
"Why
so?
I
don't
see
that.
Allow
me
to
believe
that
apart
from
our
connection
you
have
for
me,
at
least
in
part,
the
same
friendly
feeling
I
have
always
had
for
you
...
and
sincere
esteem,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
pressing
his
hand.
"Even
if
your
worst
suppositories
were
correct,
I
don't-drink-and-drive
never
would-be
on
myself
to
judge
either
side,
and
I
see
no
reason
why
our
relations
should
be
affected.
But
now,
do
this,
come
and
see
my
wife."
"Well,
we
look
at
the
matter
differently,"
said
Alexey
Alexei
coldly.
"However,
we
won't
discuss
it."
"Nobel
why
shouldn't
you
come
today
to
dine,
anyway?
My
wife's
expecting
you.
Please,
do
come.
And,
above
all,
talk
it
over
with
her.
She's
a
wonderful
woman.
For
God's
sake,
on
my
knees,
I
implore
you!"
"If
you
so
much
wish
it,
I
will
come,"
said
Alexey
Alexei
sighing.
And,
anxious
to
change
the
conversation,
he
inquired
about
what
interested
them
both.

head
of
Stepan
Arkalyk
department,
a
man
not
yet
old,
who
had
suddenly
been
promoted
to
so
high
a
position.
Alexey
Alexei
had
previously
felt
no
liking
for
Count
Anitec
and
had
always
differed
from
him
in
his
opinions.
But
now,
from

to

hatred
felt
by
one
who
has
suffered
a
defeat
in
the
service
for
one
who
has
received
a
promotion,
he
could
not
endure
him.
"Well,
have
you
seen
him?"
said
Alexey
Alexei
with
a
malignant
smile.
"Of
course;
he
was
at
our
sitting
yesterday.
He
seems
to
know
his

and
to
be
very
energetically
"Yes,
but
what
is
his
energy
directed
to?"
said
Alexey
Alexei
"Is
he
aiming
at
doing
anything,
or
simply
undoing
what's
been
done?
It's
the
great
misfortune
of

government-ANC

of
which
he's
a
worthy
representative."
"Really,
I
don't
know
what

one
could
find
with
him.
His
policy
I
don't
know,
but
one
thing-oriented

very
nice

answered
Stepan
Arkalyk
"I've
just
been
seeing
him,
and
he's
really

lunched
together,
and
I

No,

at

can't

will

The
way
in
which
Alexey
Alexei
saw
his
brother-in-law
out
was
very
different
from
the
manner
in
which
he
had
met
him.
"I've
promised,
and
I'll
come,"
he
answered
wearily.
"Believe
me,
I
appreciate
it,
and
I
hope
you
won't
regret
it,"
answered
Stepan
Arkalyk
smiling.
And,
putting
on
his
coat
as
he
went,
he
patted
the
footmen,
on
the
head,
chuckled,
and
went
out.
"At
five
o'clock,
and
not

please,"
he
shouted
once
more,
turning
at
the
door.
Chapter
9
It
was
past
five,
and
several
guests
had
already
arrived,
before
the
host
himself
got
home.
He
went
in
together
with
Sergey
Ivanovo.
Kozo
and
Pet
who
had
reached
the
street
door
at
the
same
moment.
These
were
the
two
leading
representatives
of
the
Moscow
intellectuals,
as
Obninsk's
had
called
them.
Both
were
men
respected
for
their
character
and
their
intelligence.
They
respected
each
other,
but
were
in
complete
and
hopeless
disagreement
upon
almost
every
subject,
not
because
they
belonged
to
opposite
parties,
but
precisely
because
they
were
of
the
same
party
(their
enemies
refused
to
see
any
distinction
between
their
views,
but,
in
that
party,
each
had
his
own
special
shade
of
opinion.
And
since
no
difference
is
less
easily
overcome
than
the
difference
of
opinion
about
semi-abstract
questions,
they
never
agreed
in
any
opinion,
and
had
long,
indeed,
been
accustomed
to
jeer
without
anger,
each
at
the
other's
incorrigible
aberrations.
They
were
just
going
in
at
the
door,
talking
of
the
weather,
when
Stepan
Arkalyk
overtook
them.
In
the
drawing
room
there
were
already
sitting
Prince
Alexander

Shtern
Turow
Kitty,
and

Stepan
Arkalyk
saw
immediately
that
things
were
not
going
well
in
the
drawing-room
without
him.
Darya
Alexei
in
her
best
gray
silk
gown,
obviously
worried
about
the
children,
who
were
to
have
their
dinner
by
themselves
in
the
nursery,
and
by
her
husband's
absence,
was
not
equal
to
the
task
of
making
the
party
mix
without
him.
All
were
sitting
like
so
many
priests'
wives
on
a
visit
(so
the
old
prince
expressed
it),
obviously
wondering
why
they
were
there,
and
pumping
up
remarks
simply
to
avoid
being
silent.
Turow

out
of

and
the
smile
with
which
his
thick
lips
greeted
Stepan
Arkalyk
said,
as
plainly
as
words:
"Well,
old
boy,
you
have
popped
me
down
in
a
learned
setellite
A
drinking
party
now,
or
the
_Chief
des
Fleurus,
would
be
more
in
my
line!'"
The
old
prince
sat
in
silence,
his
bright
little
eyes
watching
Karenina
from
one
side,
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
saw
that
he
had
already
formed
a
phrase
to
sum
up
that
politician
of
whom
guests
were
invited
to
partake
as
though
he
were
a
sturgeon.
Kitty
was
looking
at
the
door,
calling
up
all
her
energies
to
keep
her
from
blushing
at
the
entrance
of
Konstantin
Levin.
Young
Shtern
who
had
not
been
introduced
to
Karenina
was
trying
to
look
as
though
he
were
not
in
the
least
conscious
of
it.
Karenina
himself
had
followed
the
Petersburg
fashion
for
a
dinner
with
ladies
and
was
wearing
evening
dress
and
a
white
tie.
Stepan
Arkalyk
saw
by
his
face
that
he
had
come
simply
to
keep
his
promise,
and
was
performing
a
disagreeable
duty
in
being
present
at
this
gathering.
He
was
indeed
the
person
chiefly
responsible
for
the
chill
benzene
all
the
guests
before
Stepan
Arkalyk
came
in.
On
entering
the
drawing
room
Stepan
Arkalyk
apologized,
explaining
that
he
had
been
detained
by
that
prince,
who
was
always
the
scapegoat
for
all
his
absences
and
unpunished
and
in
one
moment
he
had
made
all
the
guests
acquainted
with
each
other,
and,
bringing
together
Alexey
Alexei
and
Sergey
Kozo
started
them
on
a
discussion
of
the
Russification
of
Poland,
into
which
they
immediately
plunged
with
Pet
Slash
Turow
on
the
shoulder,
he
whispered
something
comic
in
his
ear,
and
set
him
down
by
his
wife
and
the
old
prince.
Then
he
told
Kitty
she
was
looking
very
pretty
that
evening,
and
presented
Shtern
to
Karenina
In
a
moment
he
had
so
kneaded
together
the
social
dough
that
the
drawing
room
became
very
lively,
and
there
was
a
merry
buzz
of
voices.
Konstantin
Levin
was
the
only
person
who
had
not
arrived.
But
this
was
so
much
the
better,
as
going
into
the
dining
room,
Stepan
Arkalyk
found
to
his
horror
that
the
port
and
sherry
had
been
procured
from
Depreciation
and
not
from
Levy,
and,
directing
that
the
coachman,
should
be
sent
off
as
speedily
as
possible
to
Levy,
he
was
going
back
to
the
drawing
room.
In
the
dining
room
he
was
met
by
Konstantin
Levin.
"I'm
not
late?"
"You
can
never
help
being
late"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
taking
his
arm.
"Have
you

Who's

unable
to
help
blushing.

Kitty,
here.
Come

I'll
introduce
you
to

Stepan
Arkalyk
for
all
his
liberal
views,
was
well
aware
that
to
meet
Karenina
was
sure
to
be
felt
a
flattering
distinction,
and
so
treated
his
best
friends
to
this
honor.
But
at
that
instant
Konstantin
Levin
was
not
in
a
condition
to
feel
all
the
gratification
of
making
such
an
acquaintance.
He
had
not
seen
Kitty
since
that
memorable
evening
when
he
met
Vrye
not
counting,
that
is,
the
moment
when
he
had
had
a
glimpse
of
her
on
the
highs
He
had
known
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
that
he
would
see
her
here
today.
But
to
keep
his
thoughts
free,
he
had
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
he
did
not
know
it.
Now
when
he
heard
that
she
was
here,
he
was
suddenly
conscious
of
such
delight,
and
at
the
same
time
of
such
dread,
that
his
breath
failed
him
and
he
could
not
utter
what
he
wanted
to
say.
"What
is
she
like,
what
is
she
like?
Like
what
she
used
to
be,
or
like
what
she
was
in

What
if
Darya

told
the
truth?
Why
shouldn't
it
be
the
truthful

"Oh,

She
was
not
the

as
she
used
to
be,
nor
was
she

she
had
been

she
was
quite
different.
She
was

shy,

and
still
more
charming
from
it.
She
saw
him
the
very
instant
he
walked
into
the
room.
She
had
been
expecting
him.
She
was
delighted,
and
so
confused
at
her
own
delight
that
there
was
a
moment,
the
moment
when
he
went
up
to
her
sister
and
glanced
again
at
her,
when
she,
and
he,
and
Dolly,
who
saw
it
all,
thought
she
would
break
down
and
would
begin
to
cry.
She

turned
white,
cringe
again,
and
grew
faint,
waiting
with
quivering
lips
for
him
to
come
to
her.
He
went
up
to
her,
bowed,
and
held
out
his
hand
without
speaking.
Except
for
the
slight
quiver
of
her
lips
and
the
moisture
in
her
eyes
that
made
them
brighter,
her
smile
was
almost
calm
as
she
said:
"How
long
it
is
since
we've
seen
each
other!"
and
with
desperate
determination
she
pressed
his
hand
with
her
cold
hand.
"You've
not
seen
me,
but
I've
seen
you,"
said
Levin,
with
a
radiant
smile
of
happiness.
"I
saw
you
when
you
were
driving
from
the
railway
station
to
Erhac
"Whenever
she
asked,

"You
were

Levin,
feeling
as
if
he
would
sob
with
the
rapture
that
was
flooding
his
heart.
"And

by
the

and
led
him
away
to

He

"Very

"You

Stepan

asked
in

"We

said
Levin

"but

"Nonsense,"

said
Stepan
Arkalyk
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the

room.
The
men
went
into
the
dining-room
and
went
up
to
a
table,

with

The

stood
round

and

and
the

of

was
unequaled
in
his
skill
in
winding
up
the
most
heated
and
serious
argument
by
some
unexpected
pinch
of
Attic
salt
that
changed
the
disposition
of
his
opponent.
He
did
this
now.
Alexey
Alexei
had
been
maintaining
that
the
Russification
of
Poland
could
only
be
accomplished
as
a
result
of
larger
measures
which
ought
to
be
introduced
by
the
Russian
government.
Pet
insisted
that
one
country
can
only
absorb
another
when
it
is
the
more
densely
populated.
Kozo
admitted
both
points,
but
with
limitations.
As
they
were
going
out
of
the
drawing
room
to
conclude
the
argument,
Kozo
said,
smilingly
"So,
then,
for
the
Russification
of
our
foreign
populations
there
is
but
one
method-acting

he
said,
smiling
genially
at
their
host
and
holding
out
a
tiny
wine
glass
to
him.
Everyone
laughed,
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
with
particular
good
humor.
"Oh,
yes,
that's
the
best
method"
he
said,
munching
cheese
and
filling
the
wine-grape
with
a
special
sort
of
spirit.
The
conversation
dropped
at
the
jest.

asked

pinching
his

with
his
left

"Not

Quite

he
said,
with
a
slight
bow
moving
aside
for
the
ladies,
who
were
approaching
the
table.
"You
have
killed
a
bear,

Kitty,
trying
assiduously
to
catch
with
her
fork
a
perverse
mushroom
that
would
slip
away,
and
setting
the
lace
quivering
over
her
white
arm.
"Are
there

on
your
place?"
she
added,
turning
her
charming
little
head
to
him
and
smiling.
There

nothing

in
what
she
said,

There
was

he
said
with
a
smile.
"It
was
an

meeting."
And
he
began
telling
with
droll

how,
after
not
sleeping
all
night,
he
had,
wearing
an
old
fur-protest
full-skirted
coat,

into

compartment.
"The
conductor,
forgetting
the
proverb,
would
have
chucked
me
out
on

of

thereupon
I
began
expressing

he
said,
addressing
Karenina
and
forgetting
his
name,
"at

afterwards
you
took
my
part,
for

I
am
extremely
grateful."
"The

to

are
too
ill-defined,"
said
Alexey
Alexei
rubbing
the
tips
of
his
fingers
on
his
handkerchief.
"I
saw
you
were
in
uncertainty
about
me,"
said
Levin,
smiling
good-naturedness.

I
made

to
plunge
into
intellectual

smooth
over
the

while
he
kept
up
a
conversation
with

he
glanced

at
him.
"What

thought.

Levin
knew
she
was
listening
to
his
words
and
that
she
was
glad
to
listen
to
him.
And
this
was
the
only
thing
that
interested
him.
Not
in

room

but
in
the

there
existed
for
him
only

with

felt
himself
on

made
him

Stepan

put
Levin
and
Kitty

"Oh,
you

he
said
to

a
new
one.

"that

And
the

at

rare
exception,
can
occupy
such
positions,
it
seems
to
me
you
are
wrong
in
using
the
expression
'rights.'
It
would
be
more
correct
to
say
duties.
Every
man
will
agree
that
in
doing
the
duty
of
a
jus'
a
witness,
a
telegraph
clerk,
we
feel
we
are
performing
duties.
And
therefore
it
would
be
correct
to
say
that
women
are
seeking
duties,
and
quite
legitimation.
And
one
can
but
sympathize
with
this
desire
to
assist
in
the
general
labor
of
man."
"Quite
so,"
Alexey
Alexei
assenting
"The
question,
I
imagine,
is
simply
whether
they
are
fitted
for
such
duties."
"They
will
most
likely
be
perfectly
fitter
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
"when
education
has
become
general
among
them.
We
see
this:
"How
about
the
proverbial

the
prince,
who
had
a
long
while
been
intent
on
the
conversation,
his
little
comical

twinkling.
"I
can
say
it
before
my
daughter:
her
hair
is
long,
because
her

"Just
what
they
thought
of
the
nematocides,
before
their
emancipation,
said
Pet
angrily.
"What
seems
strange
to
me
is
that
women
should
seek
fresh
duties,"
said
Sergey
Ivanovo.
"while
we
see,
unhappily,
that
men
usually
try
to
avoid
them."
"Duty"

bound
up
with
rights-era
money,
honorable
those
are
what
women
are
seeking,"
said
Pet
"Just
as
though
I
should
seek
the
right
to
be
a
wet-weather
and
feel
injured
because
women
are
paid
for
the
work,
while
no

will
take

said
the
old
prince.
Turow
exploded
in
a
loud
roar
of
laughter
and
Sergey
Ivanovo.
regretted
that
he
had
not
made
this
comparison.
Even
Alexey
Alexei
smiled.
"Yes,
but

man

said
Pet
"while
a
woman:
"No,

was
an
Englishman

did
suckle

the

feeling
this
freedom

before
his
own
daughters.
"There

as

Sergey

"Yes,

of
Masha.

whom
he
had
had
in
his
mind
all
along,
in
sympathizing
with
Pet
and
supporting
him.
"If
the
story
of
such
a
girl
were
thoroughly
sifters,
you
would
find
she
had
abandoned

a

she
might

Darya
Alexei
broke
in
unexpectedly
in
a
tone
of
exasperation,
probably
suspecting
what
sort
of
girl
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
thinking
of.
"But
we
take
our
stand
on
principle
as
the

replied
Pet
in
his
mellow
bass.

Everyone
took
part
in
the
conversation
except
Kitty
and
Levin.
At
first,
when
they
were
talking
of
the
influence
that
one
people
has
on
another,
there
rose
to
Levin's
mind
what
he
had
to
say
on
the
subject.
But
these
ideas,
once
of
such
importance
in
his
eyes,
seemed
to
come
into
his
brain
as
in
a
dream,
and
had
now
not
the
slightest
interest
for
him.
It
even
struck
him
as
strange
that
they
should
be
so
eager
to
talk
of
what
was
of
no
use
to
anyone.
Kitty,
too,
should,
one
would
have
supposed,
have
been
interested
in
what
they
were
saying
of
the
rights
and
education
of
women.
How
often
she
had
mused
on
the
subject,
thinking
of
her
friend
abroad,
Varese
of
her
painful
state
of
dependence,
how
often
she
had
wondered
about
herself
what
would
become
of
her
if
she
did
not
marry,
and
how
often
she
had
argued
with
her
sister
about
it!
But
it
did
not
interest
her
at
all.
She
and
Levin
had
a
conversation
of
their
own,
yet
not
a
conversation,
but
some
sort
of
mysterious
communication,
which
brought
them
every
moment
nearer,
and
stirred
in
both
a
sense
of
glad
terror
before
the
unknown
into
which
they
were
entering.
At
first
Levin,
in
answer
to
Kitty,
question
how
he
could
have
seen
her
last
year
in
the
carriage,
told
her
how
he
had
been
coming
home
from
the
mowing
along
the
highs
and
had
met
her.
"It
was
very,
very
early
in
the
morning.
You
were
probably
only
just
awake.
Your
mother
was
asleep
in
the
corner.
It
was
an
exquisite
morning.
I
was
walking
along
wondering
who
it
could
be
in
a
four-inch
It
was
a
splendid
set
of
four
horses
with
bells,
and
in
a
second
you
flashed
by,
and
I
saw
you
at
the
window-dressed
were
sitting
like
this,
holding
the
strings
of
your
cap
in
both
hands,
and
thinking
awfully
deeply
about
something,"
he
said,
smiling.
"How
I
should
like
to
know
what
you
were
thinking
about
then!"
Something
important?"
"Wasn't
I
dreadfully
untie
she
wondered,
but
seeing
the
smile
of
ecstasy
these
reminiscences
called
up,
she
felt
that
the
impression
she
had
made
had
been
very
good.
She
blushed
and
laughed
with
delighted
"Really
I
don't
remember."
"How
nicely
Turow
laughs"
said
Levin,
admiring
his
moist
eyes
and
shaking
chest.
"Have
you
known
him
long?"
asked
Kitty.
"Oh,
everyone
knows
him!"
"And
I
see
you
think
he's
a
horrid
man?"
"Not
horrid.
but
nothing
in
him."
"Oh,
you're
wrong"
And
you
must
give
up
thinking
so
directly"
said
Kitty.
"I
used
to
have
a
very
poor
opinion
of
him
too,
but
he,
he's
an
awfully
nice
and
wonderfully
good-hearted
man.
He
has
a
heart
of
gold."
"How
could
you
find
out
what
sort
of
heart
he
hash
"We
are
great
friends.
I
know
him
very
well.
Last
winter,
soon
after
...
you
came
to
see
us,"
she
said,
with
a
guilty
and
at
the
same
time
confiding
smile,
"all
Dolly,
children
had
scarlet
fever,
and
he
happened
to
come
and
see
her.
And
only
fancy-food
she
said
in
a
whisper,
"he
felt
so
sorry
for
her
that
he
stayed
and
began
to
help
her
look
after
the
children.
Yes,
and
for
three
weeks
he
stopped
with
them,
and
looked
after
the
children
like
a
nurse."
"I
am
telling
Konstantin
Dmitrin
about
Turow
in
the
scarlet
fever-pitch
she
said,
bending
over
to
her
sister.
"Yes,
it
was
wonderful,
noble,
said
Dolly,
glancing
towards
Turow
who
had
become
aware
they
were
talking
of
him,
and
smiling
gently
to
him.
Levin
glanced
once
more
at
Turow
and
wondered
how
it
was
he
had
not
realized
all
this
man's
goodness
before.
"I'm
sorry,
I'm
sorry,
and
I'll
never
think
ill
of
people
again!"
he
said
gain
genuinely
expressing
what
he
felt
at
the
moment.
Chapter
12
Connected
with
the
conversation
that
had
sprung
up
on
the
rights
of
women
there
were
certain
questions
as
to
the
inequality
of
rights
in
marriage
improper
to
discuss
before
the
ladies.
Pet
had
several
times
during
dinner
touched
upon
these
questions,
but
Sergey
Ivanovo.
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
carefully
drew
him
off
them.
When
they
rose
from
the
table
and
the
ladies
had
gone
out,
Pet
did
not
follow
them,
but
addressing
Alexey
Alexei
began
to
expound
the
chief
ground
of
inequality.
The
inequality
in
marriage,
in
his
opinion,
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
infidelity
of
the
wife
and
the
infidelity
of
the
husband
are
punished
unequipped
both
by
the
law
and
by
public
opinion.
Stepan
Arkalyk
went
hurriedly
up
to
Alexey
Alexei
and
offered
him
a
cigar.
"No,
I
don't
smoke,"
Alexey
Alexei
answered
calmly,
and
as
though
purposely
wishing
to
show
that
he
was
not
afraid
of
the
subject,
he
turned
to
Pet
with
a
chilly
smile.
"I
imagine
that
such
a
view
has
a
foundation
in
the
very
nature
of
things,"
he
said,
and
would
have
gone
on
to
the
drawing
room.
But
at
this
point
Turow
broke
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
into
the
conversation,
addressing
Alexey
Alexei
"You
heard,
perhaps,
about
Prybas'
said
Turow
warmed
up
by
the
champagne
he
had
drunk,
and
long
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
break
the
silence
that
had
weighed
on
him.
"Vegetable
Prybas'
he
said,
with
a
good-natured
smile
on
his
damp,
red
lips,
addressing
himself
principally
to
the
most
important
guest,
Alexey
Alexei
"they
told
me
today
he
fought
a
duel
with
Kvochur
at
Tver.
and
has
killed
him."
Just
as
it
always
seems
that
one
bruises
oneself
on
a
sore
place,
so
Stepan
Arkalyk
felt
now
that
the
conversation
would
by
ill
luck
fall
every
moment
on
Alexey
Alexei
sore
spot.
He
would
again
have
got
his
brother-in-law
away,
but
Alexey
Alexei
himself
inquired,
with
curiosity:
"What
did
Prybas'
fight
about?"
"His
wife.
Actifed,
like
a
man,
he
did!
Called
him
out
and
shot
him!"
"Ah,
said
Alexey
Alexei
indiffierent
and
lifting
his
eyebrows,
he
went
into
the
drawing
room.
"How
glad
I
am
you
have
come,"
Dolly
said
with
a
frightened
smile,
meeting
him
in
the
outer
drawing
room.
"I
must
talk
to
you.
Let's
sit
here."
Alexey
Alexei
with
the
same
expression
of
indifference,
given
him
by
his
lifted
eyebrows,
sat
down
beside
Darya
Alexei
and
smiled
affecting
"It's
fortunate,"
said
he,
"especially
as
I
was
meaning
to
ask
you
to
excuse
me,
and
to
be
taking
leave.
I
have
to
start
tomorrow."
Darya
Alexei
was
firmly
convinced
of
Anna's
innocence,
and
she
felt
herself
growing
pale
and
her
lips
quivering
with
anger
at
this
frigid,
unfeeling.
man,
who
was
so
calmly
intending
to
ruin
her
innocent
friend.
"Alias
Alexei
she
said,
with
desperate
resolution
looking
him
in
the
face,
"I
asked
you
about
Anna,
you
made
me
no
answer.
How
is
she?"
"She
is,
I
believe,
quite
well,
Darya
Alexei
replied
Alexey
Alexei
not
looking
at
her.
"Alias
Alexei
forgive
me,
I
have
no
right
...
but
I
love
Anna
as
a
sister,
and
esteem
her;
I
beg,"
I
beseeched
you
to
tell
me
what
is
wrong
between
you?
what
fault
do
you
find
with
her?"
Alexey
Alexei
frowned,
and
almost
closing
his
eyes,
dropped
his
head.
"I
presume
that
your
husband
has
told
you
the
grounds
on
which
I
consider
it
necessary
to
change
my
attitude
to
Anna
Arkalyk
he
said,
not
looking
her
in
the
face,
but
eyeing
with
displeasure
Shtern
who
was
walking
across
the
drawing
room.
"I
don't
believe
it,
I
don't
believe
it,
I
can't
believe
it!"
Dolly
said,
clasping
her
bony
hands
before
her
with
a
vigorous
gesture.
She
rose
quickly,
and
laid
her
hand
on
Alexey

"We
shall
be
disturbed
here.
Come
this
way,
please."
Dolly,

and

with

don't,
I
don't

Dolly
said,
trying
to
catch
his

avoided
her.
"One

Darya
Alexei
said
he,
with
an
emphasis
on
the
word
"factual
"But
what
has
she
done?"
said
Darya
Alexei
"What
precisely
has
she
done?"
"She
has
forsaken
her
duty,
and
deceived
her

That's
what
she
has
done,"
said
he.
"No,
no,

No,
for
God's

are

said
Dolly,
putting
her

to
her

closing
her
eyes.
Alexey

smiled
coldly.

meaning
to

to

and
to
himself
the
firmness

his
conviction;
but
this
warm
defense,
though
it
could
not
shake
him,
reopened
his
wound.
He
began
to
speak
with
greater
heat.
"It
is
extremely
difficult
to
be
mistaken
when
a
wife
herself
informs
her
husband
of
the
fact-based

that
eight
years
of
her
life,
and

all
that's

and
that

to

he
said
angrily,
with
a

"Anna

I
cannot

"Das
Alexei
he
said,
now
looking
straight
into
Dolly,
kindly,
troubled
face,
and
feeling
that
his
tongue
was
being
loosened
in
spite
of
himself,
"I
would
give
a
great
deal
for
doubt
to
be
still
possible.
When
I
doubted,
I
was
miserable,
but
it
was
better
than
now.
When
I
doubted,
I
had
hope;
but
now
there
is
no
hope,
and
still
I
doubt
of
everything.
I
am
in
such
doubt
of
everything
that
I
even
hate
my
son,
and
sometimes
do
not
believe
he
is
my
son.
I
am
very
unhappy."
He
had
no
need
to
say
that.
Darya
Alexei
had
seen
that
as
soon
as
he
glanced
into
her
face;
and
she
felt
sorry
for
him,
and
her
faith
in
the
innocence
of
her
friend
began
to
tottered
"Oh,
this
is
awful,
awful!
But
can
it
be
true
that
you
are
resolved

am
resolved
on
extreme
measures.
There
is
nothing

for
me
to

"Nothing

to
do:
she
replied,
with
tears
in
her
eyes.
"Oh
no,
don't
say
nothing
else
to
do"
she
said.
"What
is
horrible
in
a

of
this
kind
is
that
one
cannot,
as
in
any
other-directed
loss,
in
death-and-life

trouble

but
that
one
must

said
he,
as
though
guessing
her
thought.

out

"I
understand,
I
quite
understand
that,"
said
Dolly,
and
her
head
sank.
She
was
silent
for
a
little,
thinking
of
herself,
of
her
own
grief
in
her
family,
and
all
at
once,
with
an
impulsive
movement,
she
raised
her
head
and
clasped
her
hands
with
an
imploring
gesture.
"But
wait
a
little"
You
are
a
Christian.
Think
of
her!"
What
will
become
of
her,
if
you
cast
her
off?"'
"I
have
thought,
Darya
Alexei
I
have
thought
a
great
deal,"
said
Alexey
Alexei
His
face
turned
red
in
patches,
and
his
dim
eyes
looked
straight
before
him.
Darya
Alexei
at
that
moment
pitied
him
with
all
her
heart.
"That
was
what
I
did
indeed
when
she
herself
made
known
to
me
my
humiliations
I
left
everything
as
of
old.
I
gave
her
a
chance
to
reform,
I
tried
to
save
her.
And
with
what
resultant
She
would
not
regard
the
slightest
request.
she
should
observe
decorum.
he
said,
getting
heated.
"One
may
save
anyone
who
does
not
want
to
be
ruing.
but
if
the
whole
nature
is
so
corrupt,
so

that
ruin

seems
to
be
her
salvation,
what's
to
be
done?"
"Anytime
only
not
divorce"
answered
Darya
Alexei
"But
what
is
anything?"
"No,
it
is
awful!
She
will
be
no
one's
wife,
she
will
be
lost"
"What
can
I
do?"
said
Alexey
Alexei
raising
his
shoulders
and
his
eyebrows.
The
recollection
of
his
wife's
last
act
had
so
incensed
him
that
he
had
become
frigid,
as
at
the
beginning
of
the
conversation.
"I
am
very
grateful
for
your
sympathy,
but
I
must
be
going,"
he
said,
getting
up.
"No,
wait
a
minute.
You
must
not
ruin
her.
Wait
a
little;
I
will
tell

All
the
hatred
of
that
day
when
he
had

on

divorce

sprung
up

in

He

13
When
they
rose
from
table,
Levin
would
have
liked
to
follow
Kitty
into
the
drawing
room;
but
he
was
afraid
she
might
dislike
this,
as
too
obviously
paying
her
attention.
He
remained
in
the
little
ring
of
men,
taking
part
in
the
general
conversation,
and
without
looking
at
Kitty,
he
was
aware
of
her
movements,
her
looks,
and
the
place
where
she
was
in
the
drawing
room.
He
did
at
once,
and
without
the
smallest
effort,
keep
the
promise
he
had
made
her.
to
think
well
of
all
men,
and
to
like
everyone
always.
The
conversation
fell
on
the
village
commune,
in
which
Pet
saw
a
sort
of
special
principle,
called
by
him
the
choral
principle.
Levin
did
not
agree
with
Pet
nor
with
his
brother,
who
had
a
special
attitude
of
his
own,
both
admitting
and
not
admitting
the
significance
of
the
Russian
commune.
But
he
talked
to
them,
simply
trying
to
reconcile
and
soften
their
differences.
He
was
not
in
the
least
interested
in
what
he
said
himself,
and
even
less
so
in
what
they
said;
all
he
wanted
was
that
they
and
everyone
should
be
happy
and
contented.
He
knew
now
the
one
thing
of
important
and
that
one
thing
was
at
first
there,
in
the
drawing
room,
and
then
began
moving
across
and
came
to
a
standstill
at
the
door.
Without
turning
round
he
felt
the
eyes
fixed
on
him,
and
the
smile,
and
he
could
not
help
turning
round.
She
was
standing
in
the
doorway
with
Shtern
looking
at
him.
"I
thought
you
were
going
towards
the
piano,"
said
he,
going
up
to
her.
"That's
something
I
miss
in
the
country-acoustic
"Nobel
we
only
came
to
fetch
you
and
thank
you,"
she
said,
rewarding
him
with
a
smile
that
was
like
a
gift,
"for
coming.
What
do
they
want
to
argue
for?
No
one
ever
convinces
anyone,
you
know."
null
that's
true,"
said
Levindale
"it
generally
happens
that
one
argues
warmly
simply
because
one
can't
make
out
what
one's
opponent
wants
to
prove."
Levin
had
often
noticed
in
discussions
between
the
most
intelligent
people
that
after
enormous
efforts,
and
an
enormous
expenditure
of
logical
subtleties
and
words,
the
dispute
finally
arrived
at
being
aware
that
what
they
had
so
long
been
struggling
to
prove
to
one
another
had
long
ago,
from
the
beginning
of
the
argument,
been
known
to
both,
but
that
they
liked
different
things,
and
would
not
define
what
they
liked
for
fear
of
its
being
attacked.
He
had
often
had
the
experience
of
suddenly
in
a
discussion
grasping
what
it
was
his
opponent
liked
and
at
once
liking
it
too,
and
immediately
he
found
himself
agreeing.
and
then
all
arguments
fell
away
as
useless.
Sometimes,
too,
he
had
experienced
the
opposite,
expressing
at
last
what
he
liked
himself,
which
he
was
devising
arguments
to
defend,
and,
chancre
to
express
it
well
and
genuinely,
he
had
found
his
opponent
at
once
agreeing
and
ceasing
to
dispute
his
position.
He
tried
to
say
this.
She
knitted
her
brow-beat,
trying
to
understand.
But
directly
he
began
to
illustrate
his
meaning,
she
understood
at
once.
"I
know:
one
must
find
out
what
he
is
arguing
for,
what
is
precious
to
him,
then
one
can:
She
had
completely
guessed
and
expressed
his
badly
expressed
idea.
Levin
smiled
joyless
he
was
struck
by
this
transition
from
the
confused,
verbose
discussion
with
Pet
and
his
brother
to
this
laconic.
clear,
almost
wordless
communication
of
the
most
complex
ideas.
Shtern
moved
away
from
them,
and
Kitty,
going
up
to
a
card
table,
sat
down,
and,
taking
up
the
chalk,
began
drawing
diverging
circles
over
the
new
green
cloth.
They
began
again
on
the
subject
that
had
been
started
at
dinner-dance
liberty
and
occupations
of
women.
Levin
was
of
the
opinion
of
Darya
Alexei
that
a
girl
who
did
not
marry
should
find
a
woman's
duties
in
a
family.
He
supported
this
view
by
the
fact
that
no
family
can
get
on
without
women
to
help;
that
in
every
family,
poor
or
rich,
there
are
and
must
be
nurses,
either
relations
or
hired.
"No,"
said
Kitty,
blushing.
but
looking
at
him
all
the
more
boldly
with
her
truthful
eyes;
"a

circumstances
that
she
cannot
live
in
the
family
without

while
she

At
the
hint
he
understood
her.
"Oh,
yes,"
he
said.
"Yes,
yes,
yes-no
right;
you're
right"
And
he
saw
all
that
Pet
had
been
maintaining
at
dinner
of
the
liberty
of
woman,
simply
from
getting
a
glimpse
of
the
terror
of
an
old
maid's
existence
and
its
humiliation
in
Kitty,
heart;
and
loving
her,
he
felt
that
terror
and
humiliation,
and
at
once
gave
up
his
arguments.
A
silence
followed.
She
was
still
drawing
with
the
chalk
on
the
table.
Her
eyes
were
shining
with
a
soft
light.
Under
the
influence
of
her
mood
he
felt
in
all
his
being
a
continually
growing
tension
of
happiness.
"Ah!
I've
scribbled
all
over
the
table"
she
said,
and,
laying
down
the
chalk,
she
made
a
movement
as
though
to
get
up.
"What's
shall
I
be
left
alone.
her?"
he
thought
with
horror,
and
he
took
the
chalk.
"Wait
a
minute,"
he
said,
sitting
down
to
the
table.
"I've
long
wanted
to
ask
you
one
thing."
He
looked
straight
into
her
caretaer
though
frightened
eyes.
"Please,
ask
it."
"Here,"
he
said;
and
he
wrote
the
initial
letters,
_were

i-stations,

These
letters
meant,
"When
you
told
me
it
could
never
be,
did
that
mean
never,
or
then?"
There
seemed
no
likelihood
that
she
could
make
out
this
complicated
sentence;
but
he
looked
at
her
as
though
his
life
depended
on
her
understanding
the
words.
She
glanced
at
him
seriously,
then
leaned
her
puckering
brow
on
her
hands
and
began
to
read.
Once
or
twice
she
stole
a
look
at
him,
as
though
asking
him,
"Is
it
what
I
think?"
"I
understand,"
she
said,
flushing
a
little.
"What

said,
pointing
to
the

that
stood
for

"It

she
said;
"but
that's
not

He
quickly
rubbed
out
what
he
had
written,
gave
her
the
chalk,
and
stood
up.
She
wrote,

was
completely
comforted
in
the
depression
caused
by
her
conversation
with
Alexey
Alexei
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
two
figures:
Kitty
with
the
chalk
in
her
hand,
with
a
shy
and
happy
smile
looking
upwards
at
Levin,
and
his
handsome
figure
bending
over
the
table
with
glowing
eyes
fastened
one
minute
on
the
table
and
the
next
on
her.
He
was
suddenly
radiantly
he
had
understood.
It
meant,
"Then
I
could
not
answer
differently."
He
glanced
at
her
questionnaire
timidly.
"Only
then?"
"Yes,"
her
smile
answered.
"And
n.a.
and
now?"
he
asked.
"Well,
read
this.
I'll
tell
you
what
I
should

like
so
much"
she
wrote
the
initial
letters,
i-stations,

This
meant,
"If
you
could
forget
and
forgive
what
happened."
He
snatched
the
chalk
with
nervous,
trembling
fingers,
and
breaking
it,
wrote
the
initial
letters
of
the
following
phrase,
"I
have
nothing
to
forget
and
to
forgive?
I
have
never
ceased
to
love
you."
She
glanced
at
him
with
a
smile
that
did
not
waver.
"I
understand,"
she
said
in
a
whisper.
He
sat
down
and
wrote
a
long
phrase.
She
understood
it
all,
and
without
asking
him,
"Is
it
this?"
took
the
chalk
and
at
once
answered.
For
a
long
while
he
could
not
understand
what
she
had
written,
and
often
looked
into
her
eyes.
He
was
stupefying
with
happiness.
He
could
not
supply
the
word
she
had
meant?
but
in
her
charming
eyes,
beaming
with
happiness,
he
saw
all
he
needed
to
know.
And
he
wrote
three
letters.
But
he
had
hardly
finished
writing
when
she
read
them
over
her
arm,
and
herself
finished
and
wrote
the
answer,
"Yes."
"You're

_security,
said
the
old
prince.
"But
we
must
really
be
getting
along
if
you
want
to
be
in
time
at
the
theater."
Levin
got
up
and
escorted
Kitty
to
the
door.
In
their
conversation
everything
had
been
said;
it
had
been
said
that
she
loved
him,
and
that
she
would
tell
her
father
and
mother
that
he
would
come
tomorrow
morning.
Chapter
14
When
Kitty
had
gone
and
Levin
was
left
alone,
he
felt
such
uneasiness
without
her,
and
such
an
impatient
longing
to
get
as
quickly,
as
quickly
as
possible,
to
tomorrow
morning,
when
he
would
see
her
again
and
be
plights
to
her
forever,
that
he
felt
afraid,
as
though
of
death,
of
those
fourteen
hours
that
he
had
to
get
through
without
her.
It
was
essential
for
him
to
be
with
someone
to
talk
to,
so
as
not
to
be
left
alone,
to
kill
time.
Stepan
Arkalyk
would
have
been
the
companion
most
congenial
to
him,
but
he
was
going
out,
he
said,
to
a
_subscribed
in
reality
to
the
ballet.
Levin
only
had
time
to
tell
him
he
was
happy,
and
that
he
loved
him,
and
would
never,
never
forget
what
he
had
done
for
him.
The
eyes
and
the
smile
of
Stepan
Arkalyk
showed
Levin
that
he

that
feeling

"Oh,
so
it's
not

yet?"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
pressing
Levin's
hand
with
emotion.
"N."
said
Levin.
Darya
Alexei
too,
as
she
said
good-bye
to
him,
gave
him
a
sort
of
congratulations
saying,
"How
glad
I
am
you
have
met
Kitty
again!"
One
must
value
old
friends."
Levin
did
not
like
these
words
of
Darya
Alexei
She
could
not
understand
how
lofty
and
beyond
her
it
all
was,
and
she
ought
not
to
have
dared
to
allude
to
it.
Levin
said
good-bye
to
them,
but,
not
to
be
left
alone,
he
attached
himself
to
his
brother.
"Where
are
you
going?"
"I'm
going
to
a
meeting."
"Well,
I'll
come
with
you.
May
I?"
"What
for?
Yes,
come
along,"
said
Sergey

"What
is
the

today?"
"With

Happiness

down

beginning.
"Don't

don't

it!"
shouted
Levin,
clutching
at
the
collar
of
his
fur
coat
with
both
hands,
and
muffling
him
up
in
it.

laughed
outright
a
merry
laugh,
which
was
rare
with
him.
"Well,
anyway,
I
may
say
that
I'm
very
glad
of
it."
"That
you
may
do
tomorrow,

and
nothing

Nothing,

said
Levin,
and
muffling
him
once
more
in
his
fur
coat,
he
added:
"I
do
like

so"
Well,
is
it
possible
for
me
to
be
present
at
the
meetings
"Of
course
it
is."
"What
is
your
discussion
about
today?"
asked
Levin,
never
ceasing
smiling.
They
arrived
at
the
meeting.
Levin
heard
the
secretary
hesitation
read
the
minutes
which
he
obviously
did
not
himself
understand;
but
Levin
saw
from
this
secretary's
face
what
a
good,
nice,
kind-hearted
person
he
was.
This
was
evident
from
his
confusion
and
embarrassment
in
reading
the
minutes.
Then
the
discussion
began.
They
were
disputing
about
the
misappropriation
of
certain
sums
and
the
laying
of
certain
pipes,
and

was
very
cutting
to
two
members,
and
said
something
at
great
length
with
an
air
of
triumph;
and
another
member,
scribbling
something
on
a
bit
of
paper,
began
timidly
at
first,
but
afterwards
answered
him
very
viciously
and
delighting
And
then
Svider.
(he
was
there
too)
said
something

very
handsomely
and

Levin
listened
to
them,
and
saw
clearly
that
these
missing
sums
and
these
pipes
were
not
anything
real,
and
that
they
were
not
at
all
angry,
but
were
all
the
nicest,
kindest
people,
and
everything
was
as
happy
and
charming
as
possible
among
them.
They
did
no
harm
to
anyone,
and
were
all
enjoying
it.
What
struck
Levin
was
that
he
could
see
through
them
all
today,
and
from
little,
almost
imperceptible
signs
knew
the
soul
of
each,
and
saw
distinctly
that
they
were
all
good
at
heart.
And
Levin
himself
in
particular
they
were
all
extremely
fond
of
that
day.
That
was
evident
from
the
way
they
spoke
to
him,
from
the

affectionate
way
even
those
he
did
not
know

at

as
he
always
did,
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
doing
anything
not
done
already
in
Europe,
and
now
this
did
not
in
the
least
annoy
Levin.
On
the

felt

that

avoided

his

The
ladies
of
the
Svider.
household
were
particularly
delightful.
It
seemed
to
Levin
that
they
knew
all
about
it
already
and
sympathized
with
him,
saying
nothing
merely
from
delicacy.
He
stayed
with
them
one
hour,
two,
three,
talking
of
all
sorts
of
subjects
but
the
one
thing
that
filled
his

and
did
not

that

was

that

was

Svider.
went
with
him
into
the
hall,
yawning
and
wondering
at
the
strange
humor
his
friend
was
in.
It
was
past
one
o'clock.
Levin
went
back
to
his
hotel,
and
was
dismayed
at
the
thought
that
all
alone
now
with
his
impatience
he
had
ten
hours
still
left
to
get
through.
The
servant,
whose
turn
it
was
to
be
up
all
night,
lighted
his
candles,
and
would
have
gone
away,
but
Levin
stopped
him.
This
servant,
Yegorov
whom
Levin
had
noticed
before,
struck
him
as
a
very
intelligent,
excellent,
and,
above
all,
good-hearted
man.
"Well,
Yegorov
it's
hard
work
not
sleeping,
isn't
it?"
"One's
got
to
put
up
with
it!
It's
part
of
our
work,
you
see.
In
a
gentleman's
house
it's
easiest
but
then
here
one
makes
more."
It
appeared
that
Yegor
had
a
family,
three
boys
and
a
daughter,
a
semtex
whom
he
wanted
to
marry
to
a
cashier
in
a
saddlery
shop.
Levin,
on
hearing
this,
informed
Yegor
that,
in
his
opinion,
in
marriage
the
great
thing
was
love,
and
that
with
love
one
would
always
be
happy,
for
happiness
rests
only
on
oneself.
Yegor
listened
attentively,
and
obviously
quite
took
in
Levin's
idea,
but
by
way
of
assent
to
it
he
enunciates
greatly
to
Levin's
surprise,
the
observation
that
when
he
had
lived
with
good
masters
he
had
always
been
satisfied
with
his
masters,
and
now
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
employer,
though
he
was
a
Frenchman.
"Wonderland
good-hearted
fellow"
thought
Levin.
"Well,
but
you
yourself,
Yegorov
when
you
got
married,
did
you
love
your
wife?"
"Ayatollah
and
why
not?"
responded
Yegorov
And
Levin
saw
that
Yegor
too
was
in
an
excited
state
and
intending
to
express
all
his
most
heartfelt
emotions.
"My
life,
too,
has
been
a
wonderful
one.
From
a
child
up:
he
was
beginning
with
flashing
eyes,
apparently
catching
Levin's
enthusiasm,
just
as
people
catch
yawning.
But
at
that
moment
a
ring
was
heard.
Yegor
departed,
and
Levin
was
left
alone.
He
had
eaten
scarcely
anything
at
dinner,
had
refused
tea
and
supper
at
Svider.
but
he
was
incapable
of
thinking
of
supper.
He
had
not
slept
the
previous
night,
but
was
incapable
of
thinking
of
sleep
either.
His
room
was
cold,
but
he
was
oppressed
by
heat.
He
opened
both
the
movable
panes
in
his
window
and
sat
down
to
the
table
opposite
the
open
panes.
Over
the
snow-covered
roofs
could
be
seen
a
decorated
cross
with
chains,
and
above
it
the
rising
triangle
of
Charles's
Wainer,
with
the
yellowish
light
of
Capelle
He
gazed
at
the
cross,
then
at
the
stars,
drank
in
the
fresh
freezing
air
that
flowed
evenly
into
the
room,
and
followed
as
though
in
a
dream
the
images
and
memories
that
rose
in
his
imagination.
At
four
o'clock
he
heard
steps
in
the
passage
and
peepers
out
at
the
door.
It
was
the
gambler
Myawaddy
whom
he
knew,
coming
from
the
club.
He
walked
gloomy
frowning
and
coughing.
"Poor,
unlucky
fellow"
thought
Levin,
and
tears
came
into
his
eyes
from
love
and
pity
for
this
man.
He
would
have
talked
with
him,
and
tried
to
comfort
him,
but
remembering
that
he
had
nothing
but
his
shirt
on,
he
changed
his
mind
and
sat
down
again
at
the
open
pane
to
bathe
in
the
cold
air
and
gaze
at
the
exquisite
lines
of
the
cross,
silent,
but
full
of
meaning
for
him,
and
the
mounting
lurid
yellow
star.
At
seven
o'clock
there
was
a
noise
of
people
polishing
the
floors,
and
bells
ringing
in
some
servants'
department,
and
Levin
felt
that
he
was
beginning
to
get
frozen.
He
closed
the
panel
washed,
dressed,
and
went
out
into
the
street.
Chapter
15
The
streets
were
still
empty.
Levin
went
to
the
house
of
the
Shtern
The
visitors'
doors
were
closed
and
everything
was
asleep.
He
walked
back,
went
into
his
room
again,
and
asked
for
coffee.
The
day
servant,
not
Yegor
this
time,
brought
it
to
him.
Levin
would
have
entered
into
conversation
with
him,
but
a
bell
rang
for
the
servant,
and
he
went
out.
Levin
tried
to
drink
coffee
and
put
some
roll
in
his
mouth,
but
his
mouth
was
quite
at
a
loss
what
to
do
with
the
roll.
Levin,
rejecting
the
roll,
put
on
his
coat
and
went
out
again
for
a
walk.
It
was
nine
o'clock
when
he
reached
the
Shtern
steps
the
second
time.
In
the
house
they
were
only
just
up,
and
the
cook
came
out
to
go
marketing.
He
had
to
get
through
at
least
two
hours
more.
All
that
night
and
morning
Levin
lived
perfectly
unconsciously,
and
felt
perfectly
lifted
out
of
the
conditions
of
material
life.
He
had
eaten
nothing
for
a
whole
day,
he
had
not
slept
for
two
nights,
had
spent
several
hours
undressed
in
the
frozen
air,
and
felt
not
simply
fresher
and
stronger
than
ever,
but
felt
utterly
independent
of
his
body;
he
moved
without
muscular
effort,
and
felt
as
if
he
could
do
anything.
He
was
convinced
he
could
fly
upwards
or
lift
the
corner
of
the
house,
if
need
be.
He
spent
the
remainder
of
the
time
in
the
street,
incessantly
looking
at
his
watch
and
gazing
about
him.
And
what
he
saw
then,
he
never
saw
again
after.
The
children
especially
going
to
school,
the
bluish
doves
flying
down
from
the
roofs
to
the
pavement,
and
the
little
loaves
covered
with
flour,
thrust
out
by
an
unseen
hand,
touched
him.
Those
loaves.
those
doves,
and
those
two
boys
were
not
earthly
creatures.
It
all
happened
at
the
same
time:
a
boy
ran
towards
a
dove
and
glanced
smiling
at
Levindale
the
dove,
with
a
whir
of
her
wings,
darted
away,
flashing
in
the
sun,
amid
grains
of
snow
that
quivered
in
the
air,
while
from
a
little
window
there
came
a
smell
of
fresh-baked
bread,
and
the
loaves
were
put
out.
All
of
this
together
was
so
extraordinarily
nice
that
Levin
laughed
and
cried
with
delight.
Going
a
long
way
round
by
Gaziabad
Place
and
Kit
he
went
back
again
to
the
hotel,
and
putting
his
watch
before
him,
he
sat
down
to
wait
for
twelve
o'clock.
In
the
next
room
they
were
talking
about
some
sort
of
machines,
and
swindling.
and
coughing
their
morning
coughs.
They
did
not
realize
that
the
hand
was
near
twenties
The
hand
reached
it.
Levin
went
out
onto
the
steps.
The
sledgehammer
clearly
knew
all
about
it.
They
crowded
round
Levin
with
happy
faces,
quarreling
among
themselves,
and
offering
their
services.
Trying
not
to
offend
the
other
sledge
drivers,
and
promising
to
drive
with
them
too,
Levin
took
one
and
told
him
to
drive
to
the
Shtern
The
sledgehammer
was
splendid
in
a
white
shirt-jacket
sticking
out
over
his
overcoat
and
into
his
strong,
full-blooded
red
neck.
The
sledge
was
high
and
comfortable,
and
altogether
such
a
one
as
Levin
never
drove
in
after,
and
the
horse
was
a
good
one,
and
tried
to
gallop
but
didn't
seem
to
move.
The
driver
knew
the
Shtern
house,
and
drew
up
at
the
entrance
with
a
curve
of
his
arm
and
a
null
especially
indicative
of
respect
for
his
fare.
The

hall.
certainly
knew
all
about
it.
This
was
evident
from
the
smile
in
his
eyes
and
the
way
he
said:
"Well,
it's
a
long
while
since
you've
been
to
see
us,
Konstantin
Demjanjuk
Not
only
he
knew
all
about
it,
but
he
was
unmistakably
delighted
and
making
efforts
to
conceal
his
joy.
Looking
into
his
kindly
old
eyes,
Levin
realized
even
something
new
in
his
happiness.
"Are
they
up?"
"Pray
walk
in!
Leave
it
here,"
said
he,
smiling,
as
Levin
would
have
come
back
to
take
his
hat.
That
meant
something.
"To
whom
shall
I
announce
your
honorable
asked
the
footmen,
The
footmen,
though
a
young
man,
and
one
of
the
new
school
of
footmen,
a
dandy,
was
a
very
kind-spirited
good
fellow,
and
he
too
knew
all
about
it.
"The
princess
...
the
prince
...
the
young
princesses
said
Levin.
The
first
person
he
saw
was
Mademoiselle
Linotype
She
walked
across
the
room,
and
her
ringlets
and
her
face
were
beaming.
He
had
only
just
spoken
to
her,
when
suddenly
he
heard
the
rustle
of
a
skirt
at
the
door,
and
Mademoiselle
Linotype
vanished
from
Levin's
eyes,
and
a
joyful
terror
came
over
him
at
the
nearness
of
his
happiness.
Mademoiselle
Linotype
was
in
great
haste,
and
leaving
him,
went
out
at
the
other
door.
Directly
she
had
gone
out,
swift,

was
best
in
himself,
what
he
had
so
long
sought
and
longed
for-hire
quickly,
so
quickly
approaching
him.
She
did
not
walk,
but
seemed,
by
some
unseen
force,
to
float
to
him.
He
saw
nothing
but
her
clear,
truthful
eyes,
frightened
by
the
same
bliss
of
love
that
flooded
his
heart.
Those
eyes
were
shining
nearer
and
nearer,
blinding
him
with
their
light
of
love.
She
stopped
still
close
to
him,
touching
him.
Her
hands
rose
and
dropped
onto
his
shoulders.
She
had
done
all
she
could.
had
run
up
to
him
and
given
herself
up
entirely,
shy
and
happy.
He
put
his
arms
round
her
and
pressed
his
lips
to
her
mouth
that
sought
his
kiss.
She
too
had
not
slept
all
night,
and
had
been
expecting
him
all
the
morning.
Her
mother
and
father
had
consented
without
demur,
and
were
happy
in
her
happiness.
She
had
been
waiting
for
him.
She
wanted
to
be
the
first
to
tell
him
her
happiness
and
his.
She
had
got
ready
to
see
him
alone,
and
had
been
delighted
at
the
idea,
and
had
been
shy
and
ashamed,
and
did
not
know
herself
what
she
was
doing.
She
had
heard
his
steps
and
voice,
and
had
waited
at
the
door
for
Mademoiselle
Linotype
to
go.
Mademoiselle
Linotype
had
gone
away.
Without
thinking,
without
asking
herself
how
and
what,
she
had
gone
up
to
him,
and
did
as
she
was
doing.
"Let
us
go
to
mammal
she
said,
taking
him
by
the
hand.
For
a
long
while
he
could
say
nothing,
not
so
much
because
he
was
afraid
of
desecrating
the
lofting
of
his
emotion
by
a
word,
as
that
every
time
he
tried
to
say
something,
instead
of
words
he
felt
that
tears
of
happiness
were
welling
up.
He
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it.
"Can
it
be
true?"
he
said
at
last
in
a
choked
voice.
"I
can't
believe
you
love
me,
dear,
She
smiled
at
that
"death
and
at
the
timidity
with
which
he
glanced
at
her.
"Yes!"
she
said
significantly,
deliberately.
"I
am
so
happy"
Not
letting
go
his
hands,
she
went
into
the
drawing
room.
The
princess,
seeing
them,
breathed
quickly,
and
immediately
began
to
cry
and
then
immediately
began
to
laugh,
and
with
a
vigorous
step
Levin
had
not
expected,
ran
up
to
him,
and
hugging
his
head,
kissed
him,
wetting
his
cheeks
with
her
tears.
"So

"You've

said
the
old
prince,
trying
to
seem
unmoving
but
Levin
noticed
that
his
eyes
were
wet
when
he
turned
to
him.
"I've
long,
always
wished
for
this!"'
said
the
prince,
taking
Levin
by
the
arm
and
drawing
him
towards
himself.

He
embraced
Kitty,
kissed
her
face,
her
hand,
her
face
again,
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
her.
And
there
came
over
Levin
a
new
feeling
of
love
for
this
man,
till
then
so
little
known
to
him,
when
he
saw
how
slowly
and
tenderly
Kitty
kissed
his
muscular
hand.
Chapter
16
The
princess
sat
in
her
armchair,
silent
and
smilingly
the
prince
sat
down
beside
her.
Kitty
stood
by
her
father's
chair,
still
holding
his
hand.
All
were
silent.
The
princess
was
the
first
to
put
everything
into
words,
and
to
translate
all
thoughts
and
feelings
into
practical
questions.
And
all
equally
felt
this
strange
and
painful
for
the
first
minute.
"When
is
it
to
be?
We
must
have
the
benediction
and
announcement.
And

"Here

said
the
old
prince,
pointing
to
Levin.

principal
person
in

"Whenever

Levin
blushing.
"Tongan

ask
me,

should

"Come,

"Well,

"He's
quite

"No,
why
so?"
"Well,

my
word"
said
the
mother,
smiling,
delighted
at
this
haste.
"How
about
the
trout
"Will
there
really
be
a
trout
and
all
that?"
Levin
thought
with
horror.
"But
can

and
the
benediction
and
all
that.
it
spoil
my
happoiness
Nothing
can
spoil
it!"
He
glanced
at
Kitty,
and
noticed
that
she
was
not
in
the
least,
not
in
the
very
least,
disturbed
by
the
idea
of
the
trout
"Then
it
must
be
all
right,"
he
thought.
"Oh,
I
know
nothing
about
it;
I
only
said
what
I
should
like,"
he
said
apologetically.
"We'll
talk
it
over,
then.
The
benediction
and
announcement
can
take
place
now.
That's
very
well."
The
princess
went
up
to
her
husband,
kissed
him,
and
would
have
gone
away,
but
he
kept
her,
embraced
her,
and,
tenderly
as
a
young
lover,
kissed
her
several
times,
smiling.
The
old
people
were
obviously
muddled
for
a
moment,
and
did
not
quite
know
whether
it
was
they
who
were
in
love
again
or
their
daughter.
When
the
prince
and
the
princess
had
gone,
Levin
went
up
to
his
betrothed
and
took
her
hand.
He
was
self-possessed
now
and
could
speak,
and
he
had
a
great
deal
he
wanted
to
tell
her.
But
he
said
not
at
all
what
he
had
to
say.
"How
I
knew
it
would
be
so"
I
never
hoped
for
it;
and
yet
in
my
heart
I
was
always
sure,"
he
said.
"I
believe
that
it
was
ordaining
"And
I!"
she
said.
"Even
when;
She
stopped
and
went
on
again,
looking
at
him
resolutely
with
her
truthful
eyes,
"Even
when
I
thrust
from
me
my
happiness.
I
always
loved
you
alone,
but
I
was
carried
away.
I
ought
to
tell
you:
Can
you
forgive
that?"
"Perhaps
it
was
for
the
best.
You
will
have
to
forgive
me
so
much.
I
ought
to
tell
you:
This
was
one
of
the
things
he
had
meant
to
speak
about.
He
had
resolved
from
the
first
to
tell
her
two
things.
he
was
not
chaste
as
she
was,
and
that
he
was
not
a
believer.
It
was
agonizingly
but
he
considered
he
ought
to
tell
her
both
these
facts.
"No,
not
now,
later"
he
said.
"Very
well,
later,
but
you
must
certainly
tell
me.
I'm
not
afraid
of
anything.
I
want
to
know
everything.
Now
it
is
settled."
He
added:
"Settlement
that
you'll
take
me
whatever
I
may
be-all
won't
give
me
up?
Yesh
"Yes,
yes."
Their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
Mademoiselle
Linotype
who
with
an
affected
but
tender
smile
came
to
congratulate
her
favorite
pupil.
Before
she
had
gone,
the
servants
came
in
with
their
congratulations.
Then
relations
arrived,
and
there
began
that
state
of
blissful
absurdity
from
which
Levin
did
not
emerge
till
the
day
after
his
wedding.
Levin
was
in
a
continual
state
of
awkwardness
and
discomfort,
but
the
intensity
of
his
happiness
went
on
all
the
while
increasing.
He
felt
continually
that
a
great
deal
was
being
expected
of
him-her
he
did
not
know;
and
he
did
everything
he
was
told,
and
it
all
gave
him
happiness.
He
had
thought
his
engagement
would
have
nothing
about
it
like
others,
that
the
ordinary
conditions
of
engaged
couples
would
spoil
his
special
happoiness
but
it
ended
in
his
doing
exactly
as
other
people
did,
and
his
happiness
being
only
increased
thereby
and
becoming
more
and
more
special,
more
and
more
unlike
anything
that
had
ever
happened.
"Now
we
shall
have

Mademoiselle

Levin
drove
off
to
buy
sweetmeats.
"Well,
I'm
very
glad,"
said
Svider.
"I
advise
you
to
get
the
bouquets
from
Fomon

And
he
drove
to

His
brother
offered
to

him

he
would
have
so
many

"Oh,

And
he
galloped
to
Foulds
And
at
the
confectioner,
and
at
Fomon
and
at
Foulds
he
saw
that
he
was
expected;
that
they
were
pleased
to
see
him,
and
prided
themselves
on
his
happiness,
just
as
every
one
whom
he
had
to
do
with
during
those
days.
What
was
extraordinary
was
that
everyone
not
only
liked
him,
but
even
people
previously
unsympathetic,
cold,
and
callous.
were
enthusiastic
over
him,
gave
way
to
him
in
everything,
treated
his
feeling
with
tenderness
and
delicacy,
and
shared
his
conviction
that
he
was
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
because
his
betrothed
was
beyond
perfection.
Kitty
too
felt
the
same
thing.
When
Countess
Nordstorm
ventured
to
hint
that
she
had
hoped
for
something
better,
Kitty
was
so
angry
and
proved
so
conclusively
that
nothing
in
the
world
could
be
better
than
Levin,
that
Countess
Nordstorm
had
to
admit
it,
and
in
Kitty,
presence
never
met
Levin
without
a
smile
of
ecstatic
admiration.
The
confession
he
had
promised
was
the
one
painful
incident
of
this
time.
He
consulted
the
old
prince,
and
with
his
sanction
gave
Kitty
his
diary,
in
which
there
was
written
the
confession
that
tortured
him.
He
had
written
this
diary
at
the
time
with
a
view
to
his
future
wife.
Two
things
caused
him
anguish:
his
lack
of
purity
and
his
lack
of
faith.
His
confession
of
unbelievable
passed
unnoticed.
She
was
religious,
had
never
doubted
the
truths
of
religion,
but
his
external
unbelievable
did
not
affect
her
in
the
least.
Through
love
she
knew
all
his
soul,
and
in
his
soul
she
saw
what
she
wanted,
and
that
such
a
state
of
soul
should
be
called
unbending
was
to
her
a
matter
of
no
account.
The
other
confession
set
her
weeping
bitterly.
Levin,
not
without
an
inner
struggle,
handed
her
his
diary.
He
knew
that
between
him
and
her
there
could
not
be,
and
should
not
be,
secrets,
and
so
he
had
decided
that
so
it
must
be.
But
he
had
not
realized
what
an
effect
it
would
have
on
her,
he
had
not
put
himself
in
her
place.
It
was
only
when
the
same
evening
he
came
to
their
house
before
the
theater,
went
into
her
room
and
saw
her
tear.

miserable
with

had

and

he
felt
the
abyss
that

past
from

purity,
and
was
appalled
at
what
he
had
done.
"Take
them,
take
these
dreadful
books"
she
said,
pushing
away
the
notebooks
lying
before
her
on
the
table.
"Why
did
you
give
them
me?
No,

was

she
added,

His
head
sank,
and
he
was
silent.
He
could
say
nothing.
"You
can't
forgive
me,"
he
whispered.
"Yes,
I
forgive
you;
but
it's
terrible,
But
his
happiness
was
so
immense
that
this
confession
did
not
shatter
it,
it
only
added
another
shade
to
it.
She
forgave
him;
but
from
that
time
more
than
ever
he
considered
himself
unworthy
of
her,
morally
bowed
down
lower
than
ever
before
her,
and
prized
more
highly
than
ever
his
undeserved
happiness.
Chapter
17
Unconsolidated
going
over
in
his
memory
the
conversations
that
had
taken
place
during
and
after
dinner,
Alexey
Alexei
returned
to
his
solitary
room.
Darya
Alexei
words
about
forgiveness
had
aroused
in
him
nothing
but
annoyance.
The
applicability
or
non-application
of
the
Christian
precept
to
his
own
case
was
too
difficult
a
question
to
be
discussed
lightly,
and
this
question
had
long
ago
been
answered
by
Alexey
Alexei
in
the
negative.
Of
all
that
had
been
said,
what
stuck
most
in
his
memory
was
the
phrase
of
stupid,
good-natured
Turow
like
a
man,
he
did!
Called
him
out
and
shot
him"
Everyone
had
apparently
shared
this
feeling,
though
from
politeness
they
had
not
expressed
it.
"But
the
matter
is
settled,
it's
useless
thinking
about
it,"
Alexey
Alexei
told
himself.
And
thinking
of
nothing
but
the
journey
before
him,
and
the
revision
work
he
had
to
do,
he
went
into
his
room
and
asked
the
porter
who
escorted
him
where
his
man
was.
The
porter
said
that
the
man
had
only
just
gone
out.
Alexey
Alexei
ordered
tea
to
be
sent
him,
sat
down
to
the
table,
and
taking
the
guidebook,
began
considering
the
route
of
his
journey.
"Two
telegrams.
said
his
manses
coming
into
the
room.
"I
beg
your
pardon,
your
excellent
I'd
only
just
that
minute
gone
out."
Alexey
Alexei
took
the
telegrams
and
opened
them.
The
first
telegram
was
the
announcement
of
Stremsterfer
appointment
to
the
very
post
Karenina
had
coveted.
Alexey
Alexei
flung
the
telegram
down,
and
flushing
a
little,
got
up
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room.
"`A
vulture

demented
he
said,
meaning
by
_received
the
persons
responsible
for
this
appointment.
He
was
not
so
much
annoyed
that
he
had
not
received
the
post,
that
he
had
been
conspicuously
passed
over;
but
it
was
incomprehensible,
amazing
to
him
that
they
did
not
see
that
the
wordy
phrase.
Stremsterfer
was
the
last
man
fit
for
it.
How
could
they
fail
to
see
how
they
were
ruining
themselves,
lowering
their
_received
by
this
appointment?
"Something
else
in
the
same
line,"
he
said
to
himself
bitterly,
opening
the
second
telegram.
The
telegram
was
from
his
wife.
Her
name,
written
in
blue
pencil,
"Anne
was
the
first
thing
that
caught
his
eye.
"I
am
dying;
I
beg,"
I
implore
you
to
come.
I
shall
die
easier
with
your
forgiveness,"
he
read.
He
smiled
contend
and
flung
down
the
telegram.
That
this
was
a
trick
and
a
fraud,
of
that,
he
thought
for
the
first
minute,
there
could
be
no
doubt.
"There
is
no
deceit
she
would
stick
at.
She
was
near
her
confinement.
Perhaps
it
is
the
confinement.
But
what
can
be

To
legitimize
the
child,
to
compromise
me,
and
prevent

he
thought.
"But
something

in
it:
I
am
dying:
He
read
the
telegram
again,
and
suddenly
the
plain
meaning
of
what
was
said
in
it
struck
him.
"And
if
it
is
true?"
he
said
to
himself.
"If
it
is
true
that
in
the
moment
of
agony
and
nearness
to
death
she
is
genuinely
penitent,
and
I,
taking
it
for
a
trick,
refuse
to
go?
That
would
not
only
be
cruel,
and
everyone
would
blame
me,
but
it
would
be
stupid
on
my
part."

Petersburg-based
he
said
to
his
servant.
Alexey
Alexei
decided
that
he
would
go
to
Petersburg
and
see
his
wife.
If
her
illness
was
a
trick,
he
would
say
nothing
and
go
away
again.
If
she
was
really
in
danger,
and
wished
to
see
him
before
her
death,
he
would
forgive
her
if
he
found
her
alive,
and
pay
her
the
last
duties
if
he
came
too
late.
All
the
way
he
thought
no
more
of
what
he
ought
to
do.
With
a
sense
of
weariness
and
unclear
from
the
night
spent
in
the
train,
in
the
early
fog
of
Petersburg
Alexey
Alexei
drove
through
the
deserted
Nevsky
and
stared
straight
before
him,
not
thinking
of
what
was
awaiting
him.
He
could
not
think
about
it,
because
in
picturing
what
would
happen,
he
could
not
drive
away
the
reflection
that
her
death
would
at
once
remove
all
the
difficulty
of
his
position.
Bakers.
closed
shops,
night-darkened
porters
sweeping
the
pavements
flashed
past
his
eyes,
and
he
watched
it
all,
trying
to
smother
the
thought
of
what
was
awaiting
him,
and
what
he
dared
not
hope
for,
and
yet
was
hoping
for.
He
drove
up
to
the
steps.
A
sledge
and
a
carriage
with
the
coachman,
asleep
stood
at
the
entrance.
As
he
went
into
the
entry,
Alexey
Alexei
as
it
were,
got
out
his
resolution
from
the
remotest
corner
of
his
brain,
and
mastered
it
thoroughly.
Its
meaning
ran:
"If
it's
a
trick,
then
calm
contempt
and
departure.
If
truth,
do
what
is
proper."
The
porter
opened
the
door
before
Alexey
Alexei
rang.
The
portering
Kaplan
looked
queer,
in
an
old
coat,
without
a
tie,
and
in
slippers.
"How
is
your
mistresses
"A
successful
confinement
yesterday."
Alexey
Alexei
stopped
short
and
turned
white.
He
felt
distinctly
now
how
intensely
he
had
longed
for
her
death.
"And
how
is
she?"
Korneyev
in
his
morning
apron
ran
downstairs.
"Very
ill,"
he
answered.
"There
was
a
consultation
yesterday,
and
the
doctor's
here
now."
"Take
my
things,"
said
Alexey
Alexei
and
feeling
some
relief
at
the
news
that
there
was
still
hope
of
her
death,
he
went
into
the
hall.
On
the
hattered
there
was
a
military
overcoat.
Alexey
Alexei
noticed
it
and
asked:
"Who
is
here?"
"The
doctor,
the
midwife,
and
Count
Vrye
Alexey
Alexei
went
into
the
inner
rooms.
In
the
drawing
room
there
was
no
one;
at
the
sound
of
his
steps
there
came
out
of
her
boudoir
the
midwife
in
a
cap
with
lilac
ribbons.
She
went
up
to
Alexey
Alexei
and
with
the
familiarity
given
by
the
approach
of
death
took
him
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
towards
the
bedroom.
"Thank
God
you've
come"
She
keeps
on
about
you
and
nothing
but
you,"
she
said.
"Make
haste
with
the
ice"
the
doctor's
peremptory
voice
said
from
the
bedroom.
Alexey
Alexei
went
into
her
boudoir.
At
the
table,
sitting

in
a
low
chair,

Alexey
Alexei
Seeing
the
husband,
he
was
so
overwhelmed
that
he
sat
down
again,
drawing
his
head
down
to
his
shoulders,
as
if
he
wanted
to
disappear;
but
he
made
an
effort
over
himself,
got
up
and
said:
"She
is
dying.
The
doctors
say
there
is
no
hope.

me

Alexey
Alexei
seeing
Vrye
tears,
felt
a
rush
of
that
nervous
emotion
always
produced
in
him
by
the
sight
of
other
people's
suffering,
and
turning
away
his
face,
he
moved
hurriedly
to
the
door,
without
hearing
the
rest
of
his
words.
From
the
bedroom
came
the
sound
of
Anna's
voice
saying
something.
Her
voice
was
lively,
eager,
with
exceedingly
distinct
intone
Alexey
Alexei
went
into
the
bedroom,
and
went
up
to
the
bed.
She
was
lying
turned
with
her
face
towards
him.
Her
cheeks
were
flushed
crimson-
her
eyes
glittering
her
little
white
hands
thrust
out
from
the
sleeves
of
her
dressing
gown
were
playing
with
the
quilt,
twisting
it
about.
It
seemed
as
though
she
were
not
only
well
and
blooming,
but
in
the
happiest
frame
of
mind.
She
was
talking
rapidly,
musically,
and
with
exceptionally
correct
articulation
and
expressive
intonation.
"For
Alexeyev
am
speaking
of
Alexey
Alexei
(what
a
strange
and
awful
thing
that
both
are
Alexeyev
isn't
it?,"
would
not
refuse
me.
I
should
forget,
he
would
forgive:
But
why
doesn't
he
come?
He's
so
good
he
doesn't
know
himself
how
good
he
is.
Ah,
my
God,
what
agony"
Give
me
some
water,

Oh,
that
will
be
bad
for
her,
my
little
girl"
Oh,
very
well
then,
give
her
to
a
nurse.
Yes,
I
agree,
it's
better
in
fact.
He'll
be
coming;
it
will
hurt
him
to
see
her.
Give
her
to
the
nurse."
"Anna

said
the
midwife,
trying
to
attract
her
attention
to
Alexey
Alexei
"Oh,
what
nonsense"
Anna
went
on,
not
seeing
her
husband.
"No,
give
her
to
me;
give
me
my
little
one!
He
has
not
come
yet.
You
say
he
won't
forgive
me,
because
you
don't
know
him.
No
one
knows
him.
I'm
the
only
one,
and
it
was
hard
for
me
even.
His
eyes
I
ought
to
know-all

can't

to

He
would
not
forget.
Sesa
must
be
moved
into
the
corner

and
Mariette
must
be
asked
to
sleep
with
him."
All
of
a
sudden
she
shrank
back,
was
silent?
and
in
terror,
as
though
expecting
a
blow,
as
though
to
defend
herself,
she
raised
her
hands
to
her
face.
She
had
seen
her
husband.
"No,
no!"
she
began.
"I
am
not
afraid
of
him;
I
am
afraid
of
death.

begin
directly
and

shall

Now
I

I

all,
I

it
all!"
Alexey
Alexei
wrinkled
face
wore
an
expression
of
agoraphobia
he
took
her
by
the
hand
and
tried
to
say
something,
but
he
could
not
utter
it;
his
lower
lip
quiverer
but
he
still
went
on
struggling
with
his
emotion,
and
only
now
and
then
glanced
at
her.
And
each
time
he
glanced
at
her,
he
saw
her
eyes
gazing
at
him
with
such
passionate
and
triumphant
tenderness
as
he
had
never
seen
in
them.
"Wait
a
minute,
you
don't

a
little,
stay"
She
stopped,
as
though
collecting
her
ideas.
"Yes,"
she
began;
"yes,
yes,
yes.
This
is
what
I
wanted
to
say.
Don't
be
surprised
at
me.
I'm
still
the
same:
But
there
is
another
woman
in
me,
I'm
afraid
of
her:
she
loved
that
man,
and
I
tried
to
hate
you,
and
could
not
forget
about
her
that
used
to
be.
I'm
not
that
woman.
Now
I'm
my
real
self,
all
myself.
I'm
dying
now,
I
know
I
shall
die,
ask
him.
Even
now
I
feel-good
here,
the
weights
on
my
feet,
on
my
hands,
on
my
fingers.
My
fingers.
how
huge
they
are!
But
this
will
soon
all
be
over:
Only
one
thing
I
want:
forgive
me,
forgive
me
quite.
I'm
terrible,
but
my
nurse
used
to
tell
me;
the
holy
martyr.
was
her
name?
She
was
worse.
And
I'll
go
to
Rome?
there's
a
wilderness,
and
there
I
shall
be
no
trouble
to
any
one,
only
I'll
take
Sesa
and
the
little
one:
No,
you
can't
forgive
me!
I
know,
it
can't
be
forgiven,
No,
no,
go
away,
you're
too
good!"
She
held
his
hand
in
one
burning
hand,
while
she
pushed
him
away
with
the
other.
The
nervous
agitation
of
Alexey
Alexei
kept
increasing,
and
had
by
now
reached
such
a
point
that
he
ceased
to
struggle
with
it.
He
suddenly
felt
that
what
he
had
regarded
as
nervous
agitation
was
on
the
contrary
a
blissful
spiritual
condition
that
gave
him
all
at
once
a
new
happiness
he
had
never
known.
He
did
not
think
that
the
Christian
law
that
he
had
been
all
his
life
trying
to
follow,
enjoined
on
him
to
forgive
and
love
his
enemies?
but
a
glad
feeling
of
love
and
forgiveness
for
his
enemies
filled
his
heart.
He
knelt
down,
and
laying
his
head
in
the
curve
of
her
arm,
which
burned
him
as
with
fire
through
the
sleeve,
he
sobbed
like
a
little
child.
She
put
her
arm
around
his
head,
moved
towards
him,
and
with
defiant
pride
lifted
up
her
eyes.
"That
is
he.
I
knew
him!
Now,
forgive
me,
everyone,
forgive
me"
They've
come
again;
why
don't
they
go
aways
Oh,
take
these
cloaks
off
me!"
The
doctor
unloosen
her
hands,
carefully
laying
her
on
the
pillow,
and
covered
her
up
to
the
shoulders.
She
lay
back
submissiveness
and
looked
before
her
with
beaming
eyes.
"Remember
one
thing,
that
I
needed
nothing
but
forgiveness,
and
I
want
nothing
more:
Why
doesn't
_in
come?"
she
said,
turning
to
the
door
towards
Vrye
"Do
come,
do
come"
Give
him
your
hand."
Vrye
came
to
the
side
of
the
bed,
and
seeing
Anna,
again
hid
his
face
in
his
hands.
"Under
your
face-cracking
at
him!
He's
a
saint,"
she
said.
"Oh!
uncover
your
face,
do
uncover
it!"
she
said
angrily.
"Alias
Alexei
do
uncover
his
face"
I
want
to
see
him."
Alexey
Alexei
took
Vrye
hands
and
drew
them
away
from
his
face,
which
was
awful
with
the
expression
of
agony
and
shame
upon
it.
"Give
him
your
hand.
Forgive
him."
Alexey
Alexei
gave
him
his
hand,
not
attempting
to
restrain
the
tears
that
streamed
from
his
eyes.
"Thank
God,
thank
God!"'
she
said,
"now
everything
is
ready.
Only
to
stretch
my
legs
a
little.
There,
that's
capital.
How
badly
these
flowers
are
done.
a
bit
like
a
violet-wrapped
she
said,
pointing
to
the
hangings.
"My
God,
my
God!
when
will
it
end?
Give
me
some
morphine.
Doctor,
give
me
some
morphine,
Oh,
my
God,
my
God!"'
And
she
tossed
about
on
the
bed.
The
doctors
said
that
it
was
puertorriquenos
fever,
and
that
it
was
ninety-two
chances
in
a
hundred
it
would
end
in
death.
The
whole
day
long
there
was
fever,
delirium,
and
unconsciousness.
At
midnight
the
patient
lay
without
consciousness,
and
almost
without
pulse.
The
end
was
expected
every
minute.
Vrye
had
gone
home,
but
in
the
morning
he
came
to
inquire,
and
Alexey
Alexei
meeting
him
in
the
hall,
said:
"Better
stay,
she
might
ask
for
you,"
and
himself
led
him
to
his
wife's
boudoir.
Towards
morning,
there
was
a
return
again
of
excitement,
rapid
thought
and
talk,
and
again
it
ended
in
unconsciousness.
On
the
third
day
it
was
the
same
thing,
and
the
doctors
said
there
was
hope.
That
day
Alexey
Alexei
went
into
the
boudoir
where
Vrye
was
sitting,
and
closing
the
door
sat
down
opposite
him.
"Alias
Alexei
said
Vrye
feeling
that
a
statement
of
the
position
was
coming,
"I
can't
speak,
I
can't
understand.
Spare
me!
However
hard
it
is
for
you,
believe
me,
it
is
more
terrible
for
me."
He
would
have
risen;
but
Alexey
Alexei
took
him
by
the
hand
and
said:
"I
beg
you
to
hear
me
out;
it
is
necessary.
I
must
explain
my
feelings,
the
feelings
that
have
guided
me
and
will
guide
me,
so
that
you
may
not
be
in
error
regarding
me.
You
know
I
had
resolved
on
a
divorce,
and
had
even
begun
to
take
proceedings.
I
won't
conceal
from
you
that
in
beginning
this
I
was
in
uncertainty,
I
was
in
misfeasance,
I
will
confess
that
I
was
pursued
by
a
desire
to
revenge
myself
on
you
and
on
her.
When
I
got
the
telegram.
I
came
here
with
the
same
feelings;
I
will
say
more,
I
longed
for
her
death.
Buta
He
paused,
pondering
whether
to
disclose
or
not
to
disclose
his
feeling
to
him.
"But
I
saw
her
and
forgave
her.
And
the
happiness
of
forgiveness
has
revealed
to
me
my
duty.
I
forgive
completely.
I
would
offer
the
other
cheek,
I
would
give
my
cloak
if
my
coat
be
taken.
I
pray
to
God
only
not
to
take
from
me
the
bliss
of
forgiveness"
Tears
stood
in
his
eyes,
and
the
luminous.
serene
look
in
them
impressed
Vrye
"This
is
my
position:
you
can
trample
me
in
the
mud,
make
me
the
laughing-stock
of
the
world,
I
will
not
abandon
her,
and
I
will
never
utter
a
word
of
reproach
to
you,"
Alexey
Alexei
went
on.
"My
duty
is
clearly
marked
for
me;
I
ought
to
be
with
her,
and
I
will
be.
If
she
wishes
to
see
you,
I
will
let
you
know,
but
now
I
suppose
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
go
away."
He
got
up,
and
sobs
cut
short
his
words.
Vrye
too
was
getting
up,
and
in
a
stoops
not
yet
erect
posture,
looked
up
at
him
from
under
his
brows.
He
did
not
understand
Alexey
Alexei
feeling,
but
he
felt
that
it
was
something
higher
and
even
unattainable
for
him
with
his
view
of
life.
Chapter
18
After
the
conversation
with
Alexey
Alexei
Vrye
went
out
onto
the
steps
of
the
Karennis
house
and
stood
still,
with
difficulty
remembering
where
he
was,
and
where
he
ought
to
walk
or
drive.
He
felt
disgraceful
humiliated,
guilty,
and
deprived
of
all
possibility
of
washing
away
his
humiliation.
He
felt
thrust
out
of
the
beaten
track
along
which
he
had
so
proudly
and
lightly
walked
till
then.
All
the
habits
and
rules
of
his
life
that
had
seemed
so
firm,
had
turned
out
suddenly
false
and
inapplicable.
The
betrayed
husband,
who
had
figured
till
that
time
as
a
pitiful
creature,
an
incidental
and
somewhat
ludicrous
obstacle
to
his
happiness,
had
suddenly
been
summoned
by
her
herself,
elevated
to
an
awe-inspiring
pinnacle?
and
on
the
pinnacle
that
husband
had
shown
himself,
not
malignant.
not
false,
not
ludicrous,
but
kind
and
straightforward
and
large.
Vrye
could
not
but
feel
this,
and
the
parts
were
suddenly
reversed.
Vrye
felt
his
elevation
and
his
own
abases
his
truth
and
his
own
falsehood.
He
felt
that
the
husband
was
magnanimous
even
in
his
sorrow,
while
he
had
been
base
and
petty
in
his
deceit.
But
this
sense
of
his
own
humiliation
before
the
man
he
had
unjustly
despised
made
up
only
a
small
part
of
his
misery.
He
felt
unuusal
wretched
now,
for
his
passion
for
Anna,
which
had
seemed
to
him
of
late
to
be
growing
cooler,
now
that
he
knew
he
had
lost
her
forever,
was
stronger
than
ever
it
had
been.
He
had
seen
all
of
her
in
her
illness,
had
come
to
know
her
very
soul,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
loved
her
till
then.
And
now
when
he
had
learned
to
know
her,
to
love
her
as
she
should
be
loved,
he
had
been
humiliated
before
her,
and
had
lost
her
forever,
leaving
with
her
nothing
of
himself
but
a
shameful
memory.
Most
terrible
of
all
had
been
his
ludicrous,
shameful
position
when
Alexey
Alexei
had
pulled
his
hands
away
from
his
humiliated
face.
He
stood
on
the
steps
of
the
Karennis
house
like
one
distraught,
and
did
not
know
what
to
do.
"A
sledgehammer
sir?"
asked
the
portering
"Yes,
a
sledgehammer
On
getting
home,
after
three
sleepless
nights,
Vrye
without
undrilled
lay
down
flat
on
the
sofa,
clasping
his
hands
and
laying
his
head
on
them.
His
head
was
heavy.
Images,
memories,
and
ideas
of
the
strangest
description
followed
one
another
with
extraordinary
rapidity
and
vividness.
First
it
was
the
medicine
he
had
poured
out
for
the
patient
and
spilt
over
the
spoon,
then
the
midwife,
white
hands,
then
the
queer,
posture
of
Alexey
Alexei
on
the
floor
beside
the
bed.
"To
sleep"
To
forget"
he
said
to
himself
with
the
serene
confidence
of
a
healthy
man
that
if
he
is
tired
and
sleepy,
he
will
go
to
sleep
at
once.
And
the
same
instant
his
head
did
begin
to
feel
drowsy
and
he
began
to
drop
off
into
forgetfulness."
The
waves
of
the
sea
of
unconsciousness
had
begun
to
meet
over
his
head,
when
all
at
once-300
was
as
though
a
violent
shock
of
electricity
had
passed
over
him.
He
started
so
that
he
leaped
up
on
the
springs
of
the
sofa,
and
leaning
on
his
arms
got
in
a
panic
onto
his
knees.
His
eyes
were
wide
open
as
though
he
had
never
been
asleep.
The
heaviness
in
his
head
and
the
weariness
in
his
limbs
that
he
had
felt
a
minute
before
had
suddenly
gone.
"You
may
trample
me
in
the
mud,"
he
heard
Alexey
Alexei
words
and
saw
him
standing
before
him,
and
saw
Anna's
face
with
its
burning
flush
and
glittering
eyes,
gazing
with
love
and
tenderness
not
at
him
but
at
Alexey
Alexei
he
saw
his
own,
as
he
fancier
foolish
and
ludicrous
figure
when
Alexey
Alexei
took
his
hands
away
from
his
face.
He
stretched
out
his
legs
again
and
flung
himself
on
the
sofa
in
the
same
position
and
shut
his
eyes.
"To
sleep"
To
forget"
he
repeated
to
himself.
But
with
his
eyes
shut
he
saw
more
distinctly
than
ever
Anna's
face
as
it
had
been
on
the
memorable
evening
before
the
races.
"That
is
not
and
will
not
be,
and
she
wants
to
wipe
it
out
of
her
memory.
But
I
cannot
live
without
it.
How
can
we
be
reconciles
how
can
we
be
reconciles
he
said
aloud,
and
unconsciously
began
to
repeat
these
words.
This
repetition
checked
the
rising
up
of
fresh
images
and
memories,
which
he
felt
were
thronging
in
his
brain.
But
repeating
words
did
not
check
his
imagination
for
long.
Again
in
extraordinarily
rapid
succession
his
best
moments
rose
before
his
mind,
and
then
his
recent
humiliation.
"Take
away
his
hands,"
Anna's
voice
says.
He
takes
away
his
hands
and
feels
the
shaming
and
idiotic
expression
of
his
face.
He
still
lay
down,
trying
to
sleep,
though
he
felt
there
was
not
the
smallest
hope
of
it,
and
kept
repeating
stray
words
from
some
chain
of
thought,
trying
by
this
to
check
the
rising
flood
of
fresh
images.
He
listened,
and
heard
in
a
strange,
mad
whisper
words
repeated:
"I
did
not
appreciate
it,
did
not
make
enough
of
it.
I
did
not
appreciate
it,
did
not
make
enough
of
it."
"What's
this?
Am
I
going
out
of
my
mind?"
he
said
to
himself.
"Peri
What
makes
men
go
out
of
their
minds?
what
makes
men
shoot
themselves?"
he
answered
himself,
and
opening
his
eyes,
he
saw
with
wonder
an
embroidered
cushion
beside
him,
worked
by
Varya,
his
brother's
wife.
He
touched
the
tassel
of
the
cushion,
and
tried
to
think
of
Varya,
of
when
he
had
seen
her
last.
But
to
think
of
anything
extraneous
was
an
agonizing
effort.
"No,
I
must
sleep"
He
moved
the
cushion
up,
and
pressed
his
head
into
it,
but
he
had
to
make
an
effort
to
keep
his
eyes
shut.
He
jumped
up
and
sat
down.
"That's
all
over
for
me,"
he
said
to
himself.
"I
must
think
what
to
do.
What
is
left?"
His
mind
rapidly
ran
through
his
life
apart
from
his
love
of
Anna.
"Ambitious
Sesa
Society?"
The
court?"
He
could
not
come
to
a
pause
anywhere.
All
of
it
had
had
meaning
before,
but
now
there
was
no
reality
in
it.
He
got
up
from
the
sofa,
took
off
his
coat,
undid
his
belt,
and
uncovering
his
hairy
chest
to
breathe
more
freely,
walked
up
and
down
the
room.
"This
is
how
people
go
mad,"
he
repeated,
"and
how
they
shoot
themselves
...
to
escape
humiliation,"
he
added
slowly.
He
went
to
the
door
and
closed
it,
then
with
fixed
eyes
and
clenched
teeth
he
went
up
to
the
table,
took
a
revolver,
looked
round
him,
turned
it
to
a
loaded
barrel,
and
sank
into
thought.
For
two
minutes,
his
head
bent
forward
with
an
expression
of
an
intense
effort
of
thought,
he
stood
with
the
revolver
in
his
hand,
motionless,
thinking.
"Of
course,"
he
said
to
himself,
as
though
a
logical,
continuous,
and
clear
chain
of
reasoning
had
brought
him
to
an
induce
conclusion.
In
reality
this
"of
course,"
that
seemed
convincing
to
him,
was
simply
the
result
of
exactly
the
same
circle
of
memories
and
images
through
which
he
had
passed
ten
times
already
during
the
last
hour-a-day
of
happiness
lost
forever.
There
was
the
same
conception
of
the
senselessness
of
everything
to
come
in
life,
the
same
consciousness
of
humiliation.
Even
the
sequence
of
these
images
and
emotions
was
the
same.
"Of
course,"
he
repeated,
when
for
the
third
time
his
thought
passed
again
round
the
same
spellbound
circle
of
memories
and
images,
and
pulling
the
revolver
to
the
left
side
of
his
chest,
and
clutching
it
vigorously
with
his
whole
hand,
as
it
were,
squeezing
it
in
his
fist,"
he
pulled
the
trigger.
He
did
not
hear
the
sound
of
the
shot,
but
a
violent
blow
on
his
chest
sent
him
reeling.
He
tried
to
clutch
at
the
edge
of
the
table,
dropped
the
revolver,
staggered.
and
sat
down
on
the
ground,
looking
about
him
in
astonishment.
He
did
not
recognize
his
room,
looking
up
from
the
ground,
at
the
bent
legs
of
the
table,
at
the
wastepaper
basket,
and
the
tiger-skin.
rug.
The
hurriedly
creaking
steps
of
his
servant
coming
through
the
drawing
room
brought
him
to
his
senses.
He
made
an
effort
at
thought,
and
was
aware
that
he
was
on
the
floor;
and
seeing
blood
on
the
tiger-skin.
rug
and
on
his
arm,
he
knew
he
had
shot
himself.

Chapter
19
The
mistake
made
by
Alexey
Alexei
in
that,
when
preparing
for
seeing
his
wife,
he
had
overlooked
the
possibility
that
her
repentance
might
be
sincere,
and
he
might
forgive
her,
and
she
might
not
die-cast
mistake
was
two
months
after
his
return
from
Moscow
brought
home
to
him
in
all
its
significance.
But
the
mistake
made
by
him
had
arisen
not
simply
from
his
having
overlooked
that
contingency,
but
also
from
the
fact
that
until
that
day
of
his
interview
with
his
dying
wife,
he
had
not
known
his
own
heart.
At
his
sick
wife's
bedside
he
had
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
given
way
to
that
feeling
of
sympathetic
suffering
always
roused
in
him
by
the
sufferings
of
others,
and
hitherto
looked
on
by
him
with
shame
as
a
harmful
weakness.
And
pity
for
her,
and
remorse
for
having
desired
her
death,
and
most
of
all,
the
joy
of
forgiveness,
made
him
at
once
conscious,
not
simply
of
the
relief
of
his
own
suffers
but
of
a
spiritual
peace
he
had
never
experienced
before.
He
suddenly
felt
that
the
very
thing
that
was
the
source
of
his
sufferings
had
become
the
source
of
his
spiritual
joy;
that
what
had
seemed
insoluble
while
he
was
judging,
blanc
and
hatless
had
become
clear
and
simple
when
he
forgave
and
loved.
He
forgave
his
wife
and
pitied
her
for
her
sufferings
and
her
remorse.
He
forgave
Vrye
and
pitied
him,
especially
after
reports
reached
him
of
his
despairing
action.
He
felt
more
for
his
son
than
before.
And
he
blamed
himself
now
for
having
taken
too
little
interest
in
him.
But
for
the
little
newborn
baby
he
felt
a
quite
peculiar
sentiment,
not
of
pity,
only,
but
of
tenderness.
At
first,
from
a
feeling
of
compassion
alone,
he
had
been
interested
in
the
delicate
little
creature,
who
was
not
his
child,
and
who
was
cast
on
one
side
during
her
mother's
illness,
and
would
certainly
have
died
if
he
had
not
troubled
about
her,
and
he
did
not
himself
observe
how
fond
he
became
of
her.
He
would
go
into
the
nursery
several
times
a
day,
and
sit
there
for
a
long
while,
so
that
the
nurses,
who
were
at
first
afraid
of
him,
got
quite
used
to
his
presence.
Sometimes
for
half
an
hour
at
a
stretch
he
would
sit
silently
gazing
at
the
saffron-robed
dowries
wrinkled
face
of
the
sleeping
baby,
watching
the
movements
of
the
frowning
brows,
and
the
fat
little
hands,
with
clenched
fingers,
that
rubbed
the
little
eyes
and
nose.
At
such
moments
particularly,
Alexey
Alexei
had
a
sense
of
perfect
peace
and
inward
harmony,
and
saw
nothing
extraordinary
in
his
position,
nothing
that
ought
to
be
changed.
But
as
time
went
on,
he
saw
more
and
more
distinctly
that
however
natural
the
position
now
seemed
to
him,
he
would
not
long
be
allowed
to
remain
in
it.
He
felt
that
besides
the
blessed
spiritual
force
controlling
his
soul,
there
was
another,
a
brutal
force,
as
powerful,
or
more
powerful,
which
controlled
his
life,
and
that
this
force
would
not
allow
him
that
humble
peace
he
longed
for.
He
felt
that
everyone
was
looking
at
him
with
inquiring
wonder,
that
he
was
not
understood,
and
that
something
was
expected
of
him.
Above
all,
he
felt
the
instability
and
null
of
his
relations
with
his
wife.
When
the
softening
effect
of
the
near
approach
of
death
had
passed
away,
Alexey
Alexei
began
to
notice
that
Anna
was
afraid
of
him,
ill
at
ease
with
him,
and
could
not
look
him
straight
in
the
face.
She
seemed
to
be
wanting,
and
not
daring,
to
tell
him
something;
and
as
though
foreseeing
their
present
relations
could
not
continue,
she
seemed
to
be
expecting
something
from
him.
Towards
the
end
of
February
it
happened
that
Anna's
baby
daughter,
who
had
been
named
Anna
too,
fell
ill.
Alexey
Alexei
was
in
the
nursery
in
the
morning,
and
leaving
orders
for
the
doctor
to
be
sent
for,
he
went
to
his
office.
On
finishing
his
work,
he
returned
home
at
four.
Going
into
the
hall
he
saw
a
handsome
groom,
in
a
braided
livery
and
a
bear
fur
cape,
holding
a
white
fur
cloak.
"Who
is
here?"
asked
Alexey
Alexei
"Princess
Elizaveta
Feders
Tvorba
the
groom
answered,
and
it
seemed
to
Alexey
Alexei
that
he
grinned.
During
all
this
difficult
time
Alexey
Alexei
had
noticed
that
his
worldly
acquaintances,
especially
women,
took
a
peculiar
interest
in
him
and
his
wife.
All
these
acquaintances
he
observed
with
difficulty
concealing
their
mirth
at
something;
the
same
mirth
that
he
had
perceived
in
the
lawyer's
eyes,
and
just
now
in
the
eyes
of
this
groom.
Everyone
seemed,
somehow,
hugely
delighted,
as
though
they
had
just
been
at
a
wedding.
When
they
met
him,
with
ill-educated.
enjoyment
they
inquired
after
his
wife's
health.
The
presence
of
Princess
Tverskaya
was
unpleasant
to
Alexey
Alexei
from
the
memories
associated
with
her,
and
also
because
he
disliked
her,
and
he
went
straight
to
the
nursery.

and
asked
what
the

had
said
of
the
baby.
"The
doctor
said
it
was
nothing
serious,
and
he
ordered
a
bath,
sir."
"But
she
is
still
in

said
Alexey

listening
to
the
baby's
screaming
in
the
next
room.
"I
think
it's

the
Englishwoman
said
firmly.
"What
makes
you
think
so?"
he
asked,
stopping
short.
"It's
just

it
was
at

gave

and

sir."
Alexey
Alexei
pondered,
and
after
standing
still
a
few
seconds
he
went
in
at
the
other
door.
The
baby
was
lying
with
its
head
thrown
back,
stiffening
itself
in
the
nurse's
arms,
and
would
not
take
the

breast

was

"Still

said
Alexey

"She's
very
restless,"
answered
the
nurse
in
a
whisper.
"Miss
Edwardes
says
that
perhaps
the
wet-weather
has
no
milk,"
he
said.
"I
think
so
too,
Alexey
Alexei
"Then
why
didn't
you
say
so?"
"Who's

to?

The
nurse
was
an

servant

And
in
her
simple
words
there
seemed
to
Alexey
Alexei
an
allusion
to
his
position.
The
baby
screamed
louder
than
ever,
struggling
and
sobbing;
The
nurse,
with
a
gesture
of
despair,
went
to
it,
took
it
from
the
wet-weather

and
began
walking

down,

at

Alexey

got
up,
and
walking
awkwardly

approached
the

For
a
minute
he
was
still,
and
with
the

despondent
face
gazed
at
the

but
all
at
once
a
smile,
that
moved
his

and
the
skin
of
his
forehead,
came
out
on
his
face,
and
he
went
as
softly
out
of

room.
In
the
dining
room
he
rang
the
bell,
and
told
the
servant
who
came
in
to
send
again
for
the
doctor.
He
felt
vexed
with
his
wife
for
not
being
anxious
about
this
exquisite
baby,
and
in
this
vexed
humor
he
had
no

go
to

But
his

might
wonder
why
he
did
not
go
to
her
as

and
so,
overcoming
his
disinclined
he
went
towards
the
bedroom.
As
he
walked
over
the
soft
rug
towards
the
door,
he
could
not
help
overhearing
a
conversation
he
did
not
want
to
hear.
"If
he
hadn't
been
going
away,
I
could
have
understood
your
answer
and
his
too.
But
your

ought
to

Betsy
was
saying.
"It's

answered

he
turned
back
again,
and
clearing
his
throat,
he
went
up
to
the

The

were
silent,

he
went

greeted

with

as

surprised.

Alexey
Alexei
took
leave
of
Betsy
in
the
drawing
room,
and
went
to
his
wife.
She
was
lying
down,
but
hearing
his
steps
she
sat
up
hastily
in
her
former
attitude,
and
looked
in
a
scared
way
at
him.
He
saw
she
had
been
crying.
"I
am
very
grateful
for
your
confidence
in
me."
He
repeated
gently
in
Russian
the
phrase
he
had
said
in
Betsy's
presence
in
French,
and
sat
down
beside
her.
When
he
spoke
to
her
in
Russian,
using

for
Count

to

Anna
suddenly
interrupted
him
with
an
irritation

could
not
succeed
in

"No

she
thought,

ruined
himself,

who
cannot
live
without
him.
No
sort
of
necessity"
she
compressed
her
lips,
and
dropped
her
burning
eyes
to
his
hands
with
their
swollen
veins.
They
were
rubbing
each
other.
"Let
us
never
speak
of
it,"
she
added
more
calmly.
"I
have
left
this
question
to
you
to
decide,
and
I
am
very
glad
to

Alexey
Alexei
was
beginning.
"That
my
wish
coincides
with
your
own,"
she
finished
quickly,
exasperated
at
his
talking
so
slowly
while
she
knew
beforehand
all
he
would
say.
"Yes,"
he

"and

She

"I
don't
believe
a
word
of
what's
said
about
her,"
said
Anna
quickly.
"I
know
she
really
cares
for
me."
Alexey
Alexei
sighed
and
said
nothing.
She
played
nervously
with
the
tassel
of
her
dressing-gowned
glancing
at
him
with
that
torturing
sensation
of
physical
repulsion
for
which
she
blamed
herself,
though
she
could
not
control
it.
Her
only
desire
now
was
to
be
rid
of
his
oppressive
presence.
"I
have
just
sent
for
the
doctor,"
said
Alexey
Alexei
"I
am
very
well;
what
do
I
want
the
doctor
for?"
"No,
the
little
one
cries,
and
they
say
the
nurse
hasn't
enough
milk."
"Why
didn't
you
let
me
nurse
her,
when
I
begged
to?
Anyway,
(Alexis
Alexei
knew
what
was
meant
by
that
"anywhere
"she's
a
baby,
and
they're
killing
her."
She
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
the
baby
to
be
brought
her.
"I
begged
to
nurse
her,
I
wasn't
allowed
to,
and
now
I'm
blamed
for
it."
"I
don't
blame:
"Yes,
you
do
blame
me!
My
God!
why
didn't
I
die!"
And
she
broke
into
sobs.
"Forgive
me,
I'm
nervous,
I'm
unjust.
she
said,
controlling
herself,
"but
do
go
away:
"No,
it
can't
go
on
like
this,"
Alexey
Alexei
said
to
himself
decidedly
as
he
left
his
wife's
room.
Never
had
the
impossibility
of
his
position
in
the
world's
eyes,
and
his
wife's
hatred
of
him,
and
altogether
the
might
of
that
mysterious
brutal
force
that
guided
his
life
against
his
spiritual
inclinations,
and
exacted
conformity
with
its
decrees
and
change
in
his
attitude
to
his
wife,
been
presented
to
him
with
such
distinguish
as
that
day.
He
saw
clearly
that
all
the
world
and
his
wife
expected
of
him
something,
but
what
exactly,
he
could
not
make
out.
He
felt
that
this
was
rousing
in
his
soul
a
feeling
of
anger
destructive
of
his
peace
of
mind
and
of
all
the
good
of
his
achievement.
He
believed
that
for
Anna
herself
it
would
be
better
to
break
off
all
relations
with
Vrye
but
if
they
all
thought
this
out
of
the
question,
he
was
even
ready
to
allow
these
relations
to
be
renewed,
so
long
as
the
children
were
not
disgraceful
and
he
was
not
deprived
of
them
nor
forced
to
change
his
position.
Bad
as
this
might
be,
it
was
anyway
better
than
a
rupture,
which
would
put
her
in
a
hopeless
and
shameful
position,
and
deprive
him
of
everything
he
cared
for.
But
he
felt
helplessly
he
knew
beforehand
that
every
one
was
against
him,
and
that
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
do
what
seemed
to
him
now
so
natural
and
right,
but
would
be
forced
to
do
what
was
wrong,
though
it
seemed
the
proper
thing
to
them.
Chapter
21
Before
Betsy
had
time
to
walk
out
of
the
drawing-rooms.
she
was
met
in
the
doorway
by
Stepan
Arkalyk
who
had
just
come
from
Yeliseyev,
where
a
consignment
of
fresh
oysters
had
been
received.
"Ah!
princess'
what
a
delightful
meeting"
he
began.
"I've
been
to
see
you."
"A
meeting
for
one
minute,
for
I'm
going,"
said
Betsy,
smiling
and
putting
on
her
glove.
"Don't
put
on
your
glove
yet,
princesses
let
me
kiss
your
hand.
There's
nothing
I'm
so
thankful
to
the
revival
of
the
old
fashions
for
as
the
kissing
the
hand."
He
kissed
Betsy's
hand.
"When
shall
we
see
each
otherairline
"You
don't
deserve
it,"
answered
Betsy,
smiling.
"Oh,
yes,
I
deserve
a
great
deal,
for
I've
become
a
most
serious
person.
I
don't
only
manage
my
own
affairs,
but
other
people's
too,"
he
said,
with
a
significant
expression.
"Oh,
I'm
so
glade
answered
Betsy,
at
once
understanding
that
he
was
speaking
of
Anna.
And
going
back
into
the
drawing
room,
they
stood
in
a
corner.
"He's
killing
her,"
said
Betsy
in
a
whisper
full
of
meaning.
"It's
impossible,
impossible;
"I'm
so
glad
you
think
so,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
shaking
his
head
with
a
serious
and
sympathetically
distressed
expression,
"that's
what
I've
come
to
Petersburg
for."
"The
whole
town's
talking
of
it,"
she
said.
"It's
an
impossible
position.
She
pines
and
pines
away.
He
doesn't
understand
that
she's
one
of
those
women
who
can't
trifle
with
their
feelings.
One
of
two
things:
either
let
him
take
her
away,
act
with
energy,
or
give
her
a
divorce.
This
is
stifling
her."
"Yes,
yes
...
just
so:
Obninsk's
said,
sighing.
"That's
what
I've
come
for.
At
least
not
solely
for
that
...
I've
been
made
a
_Keep
of
course,
one
has
to
say
thank
you.
But
the
chief
thing
was
having
to
settle
this."
"Well,
God
help
you!"
said
null
After
accompanying
Betsy
to
the
outside
hall,
once
more
kissing
her
hand
above
the
glove,
at
the
point
where
the
pulse
beats,
and
murmuring
to
her
such
unseemly
nonsense
that
she
did
not
know
whether
to
laugh
or
be
angry,
Stepan
Arkalyk
went
to
his
sister.
He
found
her
in
tears.
Although
he
happened
to
be
bubbling
over
with
good
spirits,
Stepan
Arkalyk
immediately
and
quite
naturally
fell
into
the
sympathetic,
poeticise,
emotional
tone
which
harmonized
with
her
mood.
He
asked
her
how
she
was,
and
how
she
had
spent
the
morning.
"Vested
very
miserably.
Today
and
this
morning
and
all
past
days
and
days
to
come,"
she
said.
"I
think
you're
giving
way
to
pessimism.
You
must
rouse
yourself,
you
must
look
life
in
the
face.
I
know
it's
hard,
but:
"I
have
heard
it
said
that
women
love
men
even
for
their
vices.
Anna
began
suddenly,
"but
I
hate
him
for
his
virtues.
I
can't
live
with
him.
Do
you
understand?
the
sight
of
him
has
a
physical
effect
on
me,
it
makes
me
beside
myself.
I
can't,
I
can't
live
with
him.
What
am
I
to
do?
I
have
been
unhappy,
and
used
to
think
one
couldn't
be
more
unhappy,
but
the
awful
state
of
things
I
am
going
through
now,
I
could
never
have
conceived.
Would
you
believe
it,
that
knowing
he's
a
good
man,
a
splendid
man,
that
I'm
not
worth
his
little
finger,
still
I
hate
him.
I
hate
him
for
his
generosity.
And
there's
nothing
left
for
me
but:
She
would
have
said
death,
but
Stepan
Arkalyk
would
not
let
her
finish.
"You
are
ill
and
overzealous
he
said;
"believe
me,
you're
exaggerating
dreading
There's
nothing
so
terrible
in
it."
And
Stepan
Arkalyk
smiled.
No
one
else
in
Stepan
Arkalyk
place,
having
to
do
with
such
despair,
would
have
ventured
to
smile
(the
smile
would
have
seemed
brutal,
but
in
his
smile
there
was
so
much
of
sweetness
and
almost
feminine
tenderness
that
his
smile
did
not
wound,
but
softened
and
soothing
His
gentle,
soothing
words
and
smiles
were
as
soothing
and
softening
as
almond
oil.
And
Anna
soon
felt
this.
"No,
Stivaletti
she
said,
"I'm
lost,
lost"
worse
than
lost"
I
can't
say
yet
that
all
is
over;
on
the
contrary,
I
feel
that
it's
not
over.
I'm
an
overstrained
string
that
must
snap.
But
it's
not
ended
yet
...
and
it
will
have
a
fearful
end."
"No
matter,
we
must
let
the
string
be
loosened,
little
by
little.
There's
no
position
from
which
there
is
no
way
of
escape."
"I
have
thought,
and
thought.
Only
one:
Again
he
knew
from
her
terrified
eyes
that
this
one
way
of
escape
in
her
thought
was
death,
and
he
would
not
let
her
say
it.
"Not
at
all,"
he
said.
"Listen
to
me.
You
can't
see
your
own
position
as
I
can.
Let
me
tell
you
candidly
my
opinion."
Again
he
smiled
discreetly
his
almondine.
smile.
"I'll
begin
from
the
beginning.
You
married
a
man
twenty
years
older
than
yourself.
You
married
him
without
love
and
not
knowing
what
love
was.
It
was
a
mistake,
let's
null
"A
fearful
mistake"
said
Anna.
"But
I
repeat,
it's
an
accomplished
fact.
Then
you
had,
let
us
say,
the
misfortune
to
love
a
man
not
your
husband.
That
was
a
misfortunes
but
that,
too,
is
an
accomplished
fact.
And
your
husband
knew
it
and
forgave
it."
He
stopped
at
each
sentence,
waiting
for
her
to
object,
but
she
made
no
answer.
"That's
so.
Now
the
question
is:
can
you
go
on
living
with
your
husbanded
Do
you
wish
it?
Does
he
wish
it?"
"I
know
nothing,
nothing."
"But
you
said
yourself
that
you
can't
endure
him."
"No,
I
didn't
say
so.
I
deny
it.
I
can't
tell,
I
don't
know
anything
about
it."
"Yes,
but
null
"You
can't
understand.
I
feel
I'm
lying
head
downwards
in
a
sort
of
pit,
but
I
ought
not
to
save
myself.
And
I
can't
.
.
...
"Never
mind,
we'll
slip
something
under
and
pull
you
out.
I
understand
you:
I
understand
that
you
can't
take
it
on
yourself
to
express
your
wishes,
your
feelings."
"There's
nothing,
nothing
I
wish
...
except
for
it
to
be
all
over."
"But
he
sees
this
and
knows
it.
And
do
you
suppose
it
weighs
on
him
any
less
than
on
you?
You're
wretched,
he's
wretched,
and
what
good
can
come
of
it?
while
divorce
would
solve
the
difficulty
completely."
With
some
effort
Stepan
Arkalyk
brought
out
his
central
idea,
and
looked
significantly
at
her.
She
said
nothing,
and
shook
her
cropped
head
in
dissent.
But
from
the
look
in
her
face,
that
suddenly
brightened
into
its
old
beauty,
he
saw
that
if
she
did
not
desire
this,
it
was
simply
because
it
seemed
to
her
unattainable
happiness.
"I'm
awfully
sorry
for
you!
And
how
happy
I
should
be
if
I
could
arrange
things"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
smiling
more
boldly.
"Don't
speak,
don't
say
a
word"
God
grant
only
that
I
may
speak
as
I
feel.
I'm
going
to
him."
Anna
looked
at
him
with
dreamy,
shining
eyes,
and
said
nothing.
Chapter
22
Stepan
Arkalyk
with
the
same
somewhat
solemn
expression
with
which
he
used
to
take
his
presidential
chair
at
his
board,
walked
into
Alexey
Alexei
room.
Alexey
Alexei
was
walking
about
his
room
with
his
hands
behind
his
back,
thinking
of
just
what
Stepan
Arkalyk
had
been
discussing
with
his
wife.
"I'm
not
interrupting
you?"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
on
the
sight
of
his
brother-in-law
becoming
suddenly
aware
of
a
sense
of
embarrassment
unusual
with
him.
To
conceal
this
embarrassment
he
took
out
a
cigarette
case
he
had
just
bought
that
opened
in
a
new
way,
and
sniffing
the
leather,
took
a
cigarette
out
of
it.
"No.
Do
you
want
anything?"
Alexey
Alexei
asked
without
eagerness."
"Yes,
I
wished
...
I
wanted
...
yes,
I
wanted
to
talk
to
you,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
with
surprise
aware
of
an
unaccustomed
timidity.
This
feeling
was
so
unexpected
and
so
strange
that
he
did
not
believe
it
was
the
voice
of
conscience
telling
him
that
what
he
was
meaning
to
do
was
wrong.
Stepan
Arkalyk
made
an
effort
and
struggled
with
the
timidity
that
had
come
over
him.
"I
hope
you
believe
in
my
love
for
my
sister
and
my
sincere
affection
and
respect
for
you,"
he
said,
redder
Alexey
Alexei
stood
still
and
said
nothing,
but
his
face
struck
Stepan
Arkalyk
by
its
expression
of
an
unresisting
sacrifice.
"I
intended
...
I
wanted
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
about
my
sister
and
your
mutual
position,"
he
said,
still
struggling
with
an
unaccustomed
constraint.
Alexey
Alexei
smiled
mournfully.
looked
at
his
brother-in-law,
and
without
answering
went
up
to
the
table,
took
from
it
an
unfinished
letter,
and
handed
it
to
his
brother-in-law.
"I
think
unceasingly
of
the
same
thing.
And
here
is
what
I
had
begun
writing,
thinking
I
could
say
it
better
by
letter,
and
that
my
presence
irritates
her,"
he
said,
as
he
gave
him
the
letter.
Stepan
Arkalyk
took
the
letter,
looked
with
incredulous
surprise
at
the
lustful
eyes
fixed
so
immume
on
him,
and
began
to
read.
"I
see
that
my
presence
is
irksome
to
you.
Painful
as
it
is
to
me
to
believe
it,
I
see
that
it
is
so,
and
cannot
be
otherwise.
I
don't
blame
you,
and
God
is
my
witness
that
on
seeing
you
at
the
time
of
your
illness
I
resolved
with
my
whole
heart
to
forget
all
that
had
passed
between
us
and
to
begin
a
new
life.
I
do
not
regret,
and
shall
never
regret,
what
I
have
done;
but
I
have
desired
one
thing-oriented
good,
the
good
of
your
soul-grabbing.
now
I
see
I
have
not
attained
that.
Tell
me
yourself
what
will
give
you
true
happiness
and
peace
to
your
soul.
I
put
myself
entirely
in
your
hands,
and
trust
to
your
feeling
of
what's
right."
Stepan
Arkalyk
handed
back
the
letter,
and
with
the
same
surprise
continued
looking
at
his
brother-in-law,
not
knowing
what
to
say.
This
silence
was
so
awkward
for
both
of
them
that
Stepan
Arkalyk
lips
began
twitching
nervously,
while
he
still
gazed
without
speaking
at
Karenina
face.
"That's
what
I
wanted
to
say
to
her,"
said
Alexey
Alexei
turning
away.
"Yes,
yes:
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
not
able
to
answer
for
the
tears
that
were
choking
him.
"Yes,
yes,
I
understand
you,"
he
brought
out
at
last.
"I
want
to
know
what
she
would
like,"
said
Alexey
Alexei
"I
am
afraid
she
does
not
understand
her
own
position.
She
is
not
a
judge,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
recovering
himself.
"She
is
crushed,
simply
crushed
by
your
generosity.
If
she
were
to
read
this
letter,
she
would
be
incapable
of
saying
anything,
she
would
only
hang
her
head
lower
than
ever."
"Yes,
but
what's
to
be
done
in
that
case?
how
explain,
how
find
out
her
wishful
"If
you
will
allow
me
to
give
my
opinion,
I
think
that
it
lies
with
you
to
point
out
directly
the
steps
you
consider
necessary
to
end
the
position."
"So
you
consider
it
must
be
endemic
Alexey
Alexei
interrupted
him.
"But
howdy
he
added,
with
a
gesture
of
his
hands
before
his
eyes
not
usual
with
him.
"I
see
no
possible
way
out
of
it."
"There
is
some
way
of
getting
out
of
every
position,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
standing
up
and
becoming
more
cheerful.
"There
was
a
time
when
you
thought
of
breaking
off:
If
you
are
convinced
now
that
you
cannot
make
each
other
happy:
"Happiness
may
be
variously
understood.
But
suppose
that
I
agree
to
everything,
that
I
want
nothing:
what
way
is
there
of
getting
out
of
our
position?"
"If
you
care
to
know
my
opinion,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
with
the
same
smile
of
softening,
almondine.
tenderness
with
which
he
had
been
talking
to
Anna.
His
kindly
smile
was
so
winning
that
Alexey
Alexei
feeling
his
own
weakness
and
unconsciously
swayed
by
it,
was
ready
to
believe
what
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
saying.
"She
will
never
speak
out
about
it.
But
one
thing
is
possible,
one
thing
she
might
desire,"
he
went
on,
"that
is
the
cessation
of
your
relations
and
all
memories
associated
with
them.
To
my
thinking,
in
your
position
what's
essential
is
the
formation
of
a
new
attitude
to
one
another.
And
that
can
only
rest
on
a
basis
of
freedom
on
both
sides."
"Divorcing
Alexey
Alexei
interrupted,
in
a
tone
of
avert
"Yes,
I
imagine
that
divorce-case
divorce,"
Stepan
Arkalyk
repeated,
redder
"That
is
from
every
point
of
view
the
most
rational
course
for
married
people
who
find
themselves
in
the
position
you
are
in.
What
can
be
done
if
married
people
find
that
life
is
impossible
for
them
together?
That
may
always
happen."
Alexey
Alexei
sighed
heavily
and
closed
his
eyes.
"There's
only
one
point
to
be
considered:
is
either
of
the
parties
desirous
of
forming
new
tieup,
If
not,
it
is
very
simple,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
feeling
more
and
more
free
from
constraint.
Alexey
Alexei
scowling
with
emotion,
muttered
something
to
himself,
and
made
no
answer.
All
that
seemed
so
simple
to
Stepan
Arkalyk
Alexey
Alexei
had
thought
over
thousands
of
times.
And,
so
far
from
being
simple,
it
all
seemed
to
him
utterly
impossible.
Divorce,"
the
details
of
which
he
knew
by
this
time,
seemed
to
him
now
out
of
the
question,
because
the
sense
of
his
own
dignity
and
respect
for
religion
forbade
his
taking
upon
himself
a
fictitious
charge
of
adultery,
and
still
more
suffering
his
wife,
pardoned
and
beloved
by
him,
to
be
caught
in
the
fact
and
put
to
public
shame.
Divorce
appeared
to
him
impossible
also
on
other
still
more
weighty
grounds.
What
would
become
of
his
son
in
case
of
a
divorced
To
leave
him
with
his
mother
was
out
of
the
question.
The
divorced
mother
would
have
her
own
illegitimate
family,
in
which
his
position
as
a
stepson
and
his
education
would
not
be
good.
Keep
him
with
him?
He
knew
that
would
be
an
act
of
vengeance
on
his
part,
and
that
he
did
not
want.
But
apart
from
this,
what
more
than
all
made
divorce
seem
impossible
to
Alexey
Alexei
was,
that
by
consenting
to
a
divorce
he
would
be
completely
ruining
Anna.
The
saying
of
Darya
Alexei
at
Moscow,
that
in
deciding
on
a
divorce
he
was
thinking
of
himself,
and
not
considering
that
by
this
he
would
be
ruining
her
irrevocably,
had
sunk
into
his
heart.
And
connecting
this
saying
with
his
forgiveness
of
her,
with
his
devotion
to
the
children,
he
understood
it
now
in
his
own
way.
To
consent
to
a
divorce,
to
give
her
her
freedom,
meant
in
his
thoughts
to
take
from
himself
the
last
tie
that
bound
him
to
life-altering
children
whom
he
loveless
and
to
take
from
her
the
last
prop
that
stayed
her
on
the
path
of
right,
to
thrust
her
down
to
her
ruin.
If
she
were
divorced,
he
knew
she
would
join
her
life
to
Vrye
and
their
tie
would
be
an
illegitimate
and
criminal
one,
since
a
wife,
by
the
interpretation
of
the
ecclesiastical
law,
could
not
marry
while
her
husband
was
living.
"She
will
join
him,
and
in
a
year
or
two
he
will
throw
her
over,
or
she
will
form
a
new
tie,"
thought
Alexey
Alexei
"And
I,
by
agreeing
to
an
unlawful
divorce,
shall
be
to
blame
for
her
ruin."
He
had
thought
it
all
over
hundreds
of
times,
and
was
convinced
that
a
divorce
was
not
at
all
simple,
as
Stepan
Arkalyk
had
said,
but
was
utterly
impossible.
He
did
not
believe
a
single
word
Stepan
Arkalyk
said
to
him;
to
every
word
he
had
a
thousand
objections
to
make,
but
he
listened
to
him,
feeling
that
his
words
were
the
expression
of
that
mighty
brutal
force
which
controlled
his
life
and
to
which
he
would
have
to
null
"The
only
question
is
on
what
terms
you
agree
to
give
her
a
divorce.
She
does
not
want
anything,
does
not
dare
ask
you
for
anything,
she
leaves
it
all
to
your
generosity?
"My
God,
my
God!
what
for?"
thought
Alexey
Alexei
remembering
the
details
of
divorce
proceedings
in
which
the
husband
took
the
blame
on
himself,
and
with
just
the
same
gesture
with
which
Vrye
had
done
the
same,
he
hid
his
face
for
shame
in
his
hands.
"You
are
distressed,
I
understand
that.
But
if
you
think
it
over:
"Why
shall
smock
thee
on
thy
right
cheek,
turn
to
him
the
other
also?
and
if
any
man
take
away
thy
coat,
let
him
have
thy
cloak
also,"
thought
Alexey
Alexei
"Yes,
yes!"
he
cried
in
a
shrill
voice.
"I
will
take
the
disgrace
on
myself,
I
will
give
up
even
my
son,
but
...
but
wouldn't
it
be
better
to
let
it
alone?
Still
you
may
do
as
you
like:
And
turning
away
so
that
his
brother-in-law
could
not
see
him,
he
sat
down
on
a
chair
at
the
window.
There
was
bitterness,
there
was
shame
in
his
heart,
but
with
bitterness
and
shame
he
felt
joy
and
emotion
at
the
height
of
his
own
meet
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
touched.
He
was
silent
for
a
space.
"Alias
Alexei
believe
me,
she
appreciates
your
generosity.
he
said.
"But
it
seems
it
was
the
will
of
God,"
he
added,
and
as
he
said
it
felt
how
foolish
a
remark
it
was,
and
with
difficulty
repressed
a
smile
at
his
own
foolishness.
Alexey
Alexei
would
have
made
some
reply,
but
tears
stopped
him.
"This
is
an
unhappy
fatality,
and
one
must
accept
it
as
such.
I
accept
the
calamity
as
an
accomplished
fact,
and
am
doing
my
best
to
help
both
her
and
you,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
When
he
went
out
of
his
brother-in-law's
room
he
was
touched,
but
that
did
not
prevent
him
from
being
glad
he
had
successfully
brought
the
matter
to
a
conclusion,
for
he
felt
certain
Alexey
Alexei
would
not
go
back
on
his
words.
To
this
satisfaction
was
added
the
fact
that
an
idea
had
just
struck
him
for
a
riddle
turning
on
his
successful
achievement,
that
when
the
affair
was
over
he
would
ask
his
wife
and
most
intimate
friends.
He
put
this
riddle
into
two
or
three
different
ways.
"But
I'll
work
it
out
better
than
that,"
he
said
to
himself
with
a
smile.
Chapter
23
Vrye
wound
had
been
a
dangerous
one,
though
it
did
not
touch
the
heart,
and
for
several
days
he
had
lain
between
life
and
death.
The
first
time
he
was
able
to
speak,
Varya,
his
brother's
wife,
was
alone
in
the
room.
"Vassar
he
said,
looking
sternly
at
her,
"I
shot
myself
by
accident.
And
please
never
speak
of
it,
and
tell
everyone
so.
Or
else
it's
too
ridiculous."
Without
answering
his
words,
Varya,
bent
over
him,
and
with
a
delighted
smile
gazed
into
his
face.
His
eyes
were
clear,
not
feverishly
but
their
expression
was
stern.
"Thank
God!"'
she
said.
"You're
not
in
pained
"A
little
here."
He
pointed
to
his
breast.
"Then
let
me
change
your
bandages."
In
silence,
stiffening
his
broad
jaws,
he
looked
at
her
while
she
bandaged
him
up.
When
she
had
finished
he
said:
"I'm
not
delirious.
Please
manage
that
there
may
be
no
talk
of
my
having
shot
myself
on
purpose."
"No
one
does
say
so.
Only
I
hope
you
won't
shoot
yourself
by
accident
any
more,"
she
said,
with
a
questioning
smile.
"Of
course
I
won't,
but
it
would
have
been
better:
And
he
smiled
gloomy
In
spite
of
these
words
and
this
smile,
which
so
frightened
Varya,
when
the
inflammation
was
over
and
he
began
to
recover,
he
felt
that
he
was
completely
free
from
one
part
of
his
misery.
By
his
action
he
had,
as
it
were,
washed
away
the
shame
and
humiliation
he
had
felt
before.
He
could
now
think
calmly
of
Alexey
Alexei
He
recognized
all
his
magnanimity,"
but
he
did
not
now
feel
himself
humiliated
by
it.
Besides,
he
got
back
again
into
the
beaten
track
of
his
life.
He
saw
the
possibility
of
looking
men
in
the
face
again
without
shame,
and
he
could
live
in
accordance
with
his
own
habits.
One
thing
he
could
not
pluck
out
of
his
heart,
though
he
never
ceased
struggling
with
it,
was
the
regret,
amounting
to
despair,
that
he
had
lost
her
forever.
That
now,
having
expiration
his
sin
against
the
husband,
he
was
bound
to
renounce
her,
and
never
in
future
to
stand
between
her
with
her
repentance
and
her
husband,
he
had
firmly
decided
in
his
heart;
but
he
could
not
tear
out
of
his
heart
his
regret
at
the
loss
of
her
love,
he
could
not
erase
from
his
memory
those
moments
of
happiness
that
he
had
so
little
prized
at
the
time,
and
that
haunted
him
in
all
their
charm.
Sesa
had
planned
his
appointment
at
Tashkent
and
Vrye
agreed
to
the
proposition
without
the
slightest
hesitation.
But
the
nearer
the
time
of
departure
came,
the
bitterest
was
the
sacrifice
he
was
making
to
what
he
thought
his
duty.
His
wound
had
healed,
and
he
was
driving
about
making
preparations
for
his
departure
for
Tashkent
"To
see
her
once
and
then
to
bury
myself,
to
die,"
he
thought,
and
as
he
was
paying
farewell
visits,
he
uttered
this
thought
to
null
Charged
with
this
commission,
Betsy
had
gone
to
Anna,
and
brought
him
back
a
negative
reply.
"So
much
the
better,"
thought
Vrye
when
he
received
the
news.
"It
was
a
weakness,
which
would
have
shattered
what
strength
I
have
left."
Next
day
Betsy
herself
came
to
him
in
the
morning,
and
announced
that
she
had
heard
through
Obninsk's
as
a
positive
fact
that
Alexey
Alexei
had
agreed
to
a
divorce,
and
that
therefore
Vrye
could
see
Anna.
Without
even
troubling
himself
to
see
Betsy
out
of
his
flat,
forgetting
all
his
resolutions,
without
asking
when
he
could
see
her,
where
her
husband
was,
Vrye
drove
straight
to
the
Karennis
He
ran
up
the
stairs
seeing
no
one
and
nothing,
and
with
a
rapid
step,
almost
breaking
into
a
run,
he
went
into
her
room.
And
without
considering,
without
noticing
whether
there
was
anyone
in
the
room
or
not,
he
flung
his
arms
round
her,
and
began
to
cover
her
face,
her
hands,
her
neck
with
kisses.
Anna
had
been
preparing
herself
for
this
meeting,
had
thought
what
she
would
say
to
him,
but
she
did
not
succeed
in
saying
anything
of
it;
his
passion
mastered
her.
She
tried
to
calm
him,
to
calm
herself,
but
it
was
too
late.
His
feeling
infected
her.
Her
lips
trembled
so
that
for
a
long
while
she
could
say
nothing.
"Yes,
you
have
conquered
me,
and
I
am
yours,"
she
said
at
last,
pressing
his
hands
to
her
bosom.
"So
it
had
to
be,"
he
said.
"So
long
as
we
live,
it
must
be
so.
I
know
it
now."
"That's
true,"
she
said,
getting
whiter
and
whiter,
and
embracing
his
head.
"Still
there
is
something
terrible
in
it
after
all
that
has
happened."
"It
will
all
pass,
it
will
all
pass;
we
shall
be
so
happy.
Our
love,
if
it
could
be
stronger,
will
be
strengthened
by
there
being
something
terrible
in
it,"
he
said,
lifting
his
head
and
parting
his
strong
teeth
in
a
smile.
And
she
could
not
but
respond
with
a
smile.
to
his
words,
but
to
the
love
in
his
eyes.
She
took
his
hand
and
stroked
her
chilled
cheeks
and
cropped
head
with
it.
"I
don't
know
you
with
this
short
hair.
You've
grown
so
pretty.
A
boy.
But
how
pale
you
are!"
"Yes,
I'm
very
weak,"
she
said,
smiling.
And
her
lips
began
trembling
again.
"We'll
go
to
Italy;
you
will
get
strong,"
he
said.
"Can
it
be
possible
we
could
be
like
husband
and
wife,
alone,
your
family
with
you?"
she
said,
looking
close
into
his
eyes.
"It
only
seems
strange
to
me
that
it
can
ever
have
been
otherwise."
"Stock
says
that
_in
has
agreed
to
everything,
but
I
can't
accept
_in
generosity.
she
said,
looking
dreamily:
past
Vrye
face.
"I
don't
want
a
divorce;
it's
all
the
same
to
me
now.
Only
I
don't
know
what
he
will
decide
about
Sesa
He
could
not
conceive
how
at
this
moment
of
their
meeting
she
could
remember
and
think
of
her
son,
of
divorce.
What
did
it
all
matter?
"Don't
speak
of
that,
don't
think
of
it,"
he
said,
turning
her
hand
in
his,
and
trying
to
draw
her
attention
to
him;
but
still
she
did
not
look
at
him.
"Oh,
why
didn't
I
die!
it
would
have
been
better,"
she
said,
and
silent
tears
flowed
down
both
her
cheeky
but
she
tried
to
smile,
so
as
not
to
wound
him.
To
decline
the
flattering
and
dangerous
appointment
at
Tashkent
would
have
been,
Vrye
had
till
then
considered,
disgraceful
and
impossible.
But
now,
without
an
instant,
consideration,
he
declined
it,
and
observing
dissatisfaction
in
the
most
exalted
quarters
at
this
step,
he
immediately
retired
from
the
army.
A
month
later
Alexey
Alexei
was
left
alone
with
his
son
in
his
house
at
Petersburg,
while
Anna
and
Vrye
had
gone
abroad,
not
having
obtained
a
divorce,
but
having
absolutely
declined
all
idea
of
one.
PART
FIVE
Chapter
1
Princess
Shtern
considered
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
the
wedding
to
take
place
before
Lent,
just
five
weeks
off,
since
not
half
the
trout
could
possibly
be
ready
by
that
time.
But
she
could
not
but
agree
with
Levin
that
to
fix
it
for
after
Lent
would
be
putting
it
off
too
late,
as
an
old
aunt
of
Prince
Shtern
was
seriously
ill
and
might
die,
and
then
the
mourning
would
delay
the
wedding
still
longer.
And
therefore,
deciding
to
divide
the
trout
into
two
parts-buying
larger
and
smaller
trout
princess
consented
to
have
the
wedding
before
Lent.
She
determined
that
she
would
get
the
smaller
part
of
the
trout
all
ready
now,
and
the
larger
part
should
be
made
later,
and
she
was
much
vexed
with
Levin
because
he
was
incapable
of
giving
her
a
serious
answer
to
the
question
whether
he
agreed
to
this
arrangement
or
not.
The
arrangement
was
the
more
suitable
as,
immediately
after
the
wedding,
the
young
people
were
to
go
to
the
country,
where
the
more
important
part
of
the
trout
would
not
be
wanted.
Levin
still
continued
in
the
same
delirious
condition
in
which
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
and
his
happiness
constituted
the
chief
and
sole
aim
of
all
existence,
and
that
he
need
not
now
think
or
care
about
anything,
that
everything
was
being
done
and
would
be
done
for
him
by
others.
He
had
not
even
plans
and
aims
for
the
future,
he
left
its
arrangement
to
others,
knowing
that
everything
would
be
delightful.
His
brother
Sergey

Stepan

the
princess

what
he
had
to
do.
All
he
did
was
to
agree
entirely
with
everything
suggested
to
him.
His
brother
raised
money
for
him,
the
princess
advised
him
to
leave
Moscow
after
the
wedding.
Stepan
Arkalyk
advised
him
to
go
abroad.
He
agreed
to
everything.
"Do
what
you
choose,
if
it
amuses
you.
I'm
happy,
and
my
happiness
can
be
no
greater
and
no
less
for
anything
you
do,"
he
thought.
When
he
told
Kitty
of
Stepan
Arkalyk
advice
that
they
should
go
abroad,
he
was
much
surprised
that
she
did
not
agree
to
this,
and
had
some
definite
requirements
of
her
own
in
regard
to
their
future.
She
knew
Levin
had
work
he
loved
in
the
country.
She
did
not,
as
he
saw,
understand
this
work,
she
did
not
even
care
to
understand
it.
But
that
did
not
prevent
her
from
regarding
it
as
a
matter
of
great
importance.
And
then
she
knew
their
home
would
be
in
the
country,
and
she
wanted
to
go,
not
abroad
where
she
was
not
going
to
live,
but
to
the
place
where
their
home
would
be.
This
definitely
expressed
purpose
astonished
Levin.
But
since
he
did
not
care
either
way,
he
immediately
asked
Stepan
Arkalyk
as
though
it
were
his
duty,
to
go
down
to
the
country
and
to
arrange
everything
there
to
the
best
of
his
ability
with
the
taste
of
which
he
had
so
much.
"But
I
say,"
Stepan
Arkalyk
said
to
him
one
day
after
he
had
come
back
from
the
country,
where
he
had
got
everything
ready
for
the
young
people's
arrival,
"have
you
a
certificate
of
having
been
at
confessional
"No.
But
what
of
it?"
"You
can't
be
married
without
it."
"`A
ailerons
ailerons
cried
Levin.
"Why,
I
believe
it's
nine
years
since
I've
taken
the
sacrament,"
I
never
thought
of
it."
"You're
a
pretty
fellow"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
laughing,
"and
you
call
me
a
Nihon
But
this
won't
do,
you
know.
You
must
take
the
sacramental
"Whenever
There
are
four
days
left
now."
Stepan
Arkalyk
arranged
this
also,
and
Levin
had
to
go
to
confession.
To
Levin,
as
to
any
unbeliever,
who
respects
the
beliefs
of
others,
it
was
exceedingly
disagreeable
to
be
present
at
and
take
part
in
church
ceremonies.
At
this
moment,
in
his
present
softened
state
of
feeling,
sensitive
to
everything,
this
inevitable
act
of
hypocrisy
was
not
merely
painful
to
Levin,
it
seemed
to
him
utterly
impossible.
Now,
in
the
heyday
of
his
highest
glory,
his
fullest
flower,
he
would
have
to
be
a
liar
or
a
scoffing
He
felt
incapable
of
being
either.
But
though
he
repeatedly
plied
Stepan
Arkalyk
with
questions
as
to
the
possibility
of
obtaining
a
certificate
without
actually
communicating,"
Stepan
Arkalyk
maintained
that
it
was
out
of
the
question.
"Besides,
what
is
it
to
you-and-me
days?
And
he's
an
awfully
nice
clever
old
fellow.
He'll
pull
the
tooth
out
for
you
so
gently,
you
won't
notice
it."
Standing
at
the
first
litany:
Levin
attempted
to
revive
in
himself
his
youthful
recollections
of
the
intense
religious
emotion
he
had
passed
through
between
the
ages
of
sixteen
and
seventeenth
But
he
was
at
once
convinced
that
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
him.
He
attempted
to
look
at
it
all
as
an
empty
custom,
having
no
sort
of
meaning,
like
the
custom
of
paying
calls.
But
he
felt
that
he
could
not
do
that
either.
Levin
found
himself,
like
the
majority
of
his
contemporaries,
in
the
vaguest
position
in
regard
to
religion.
Believe
he
could
not,
and
at
the
same
time
he
had
no
firm
conviction
that
it
was
all
wrong.
And
consequently,
not
being
able
to
believe
in
the
significance
of
what
he
was
doing
nor
to
regard
it
with
indifference
as
an
empty
formality,
during
the
whole
period
of
preparing
for
the
sacrament
he
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
discomfort
and
shame
at
doing
what
he
did
not
himself
understand,
and
what,
as
an
inner
voice
told
him,
was
therefore
false
and
wrong.
During
the
service
he
would
first
listen
to
the
prayers,
trying
to
attach
some
meaning
to
them
not
discordant
with
his
own
views;
then
feeling
that
he
could
not
understand
and
must
condemn
them,
he
tried
not
to
listen
to
them,
but
to
attend
to
the
thoughts,
observations,
and
memories
which
floated
through
his
brain
with
extreme
vividness,
during
this
idle
time
of
standing
in
church.
He
had
stood
through
the
litany:
the
evening
service
and
the
midnight
service,
and
the
next
day
he
got
up
earlier
than
usual,
and
without
having
tea
went
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
to
the
church
for
the
morning
service
and
the
confession.
There
was
no
one
in
the
church
but
a
beggar
soldier,
two
old
women,
and
the
church
officials.
A
young
deacon.
whose
long
back
showed
in
two
distinct
halves
through
his
thin
undercast
met
him,
and
at
once
going
to
a
little
table
at
the
wall
read
the
exhortation.
During
the
reading,
especially
at
the
frequent
and
rapid
repetition
of
the
same
words,
"Lord,
have
mercy
on
us!"
which
resounded
with
an
echo-planar
Levin
felt
that
thought
was
shut
and
sealed
up,
and
that
it
must
not
be
touched
or
stirred
now
or
confusion
would
be
the
resultant
and
so
standing
behind
the
deacon
he
went
on
thinking
of
his
own
affairs,
neither
listening
nor
examining
what
was
said.
"It's
wonderful
what
expression
there
is
in
her
hand,"
he
thought,
remembering
how
they
had
been
sitting
the
day
before
at
a
corner
table.
They
had
nothing
to
talk
about,
as
was
almost
always
the
case
at
this
time,
and
laying
her
hand
on
the
table
she
kept
opening
and
shutting
it,
and
laughed
herself
as
she
watched
her
action.
He
remembered
how
he
had
kissed
it
and
then
had
examined
the
lines
on
the
pink
palm.
"Have
mercy
on
us
again!"
thought
Levin,
crossing
himself,

looking
at

bowing
before
him.
"She
took
my
hand
then
and
examined
the
lines
'You've
got
a
splendid
hand,'
she
said."
And
he
looked
at
his
own
hand
and
the
short
hand
of
the
deacon.
"Yes,
now
it
will
soon
be
over,"
he
thought.
"No,
it
seems
to
be
beginning
again,"
he
thought,
listening
to
the
prayers.
"No,
it's
just
ending:
there

is

That's

at

end."
The

and
the

he
would
put

register,
and
his
new
boots
creaking
jauntily
over
the
flagwaving
of
the
empty
church,
he
went
to
the
altar.
A
moment
later
he

out

and
beckoned
to
Levin.
Thought,
till
then
locked
up,
began
to
stir
in
Levin's
head,
but
he
made
haste
to
drive
it
away.
"It
will
come
right
somehow,"
he
thought,
and
went
towards
the
altar.
He
went
up
the
steps,
and
turning
to
the
right
saw
the
priest.
The
priest,
a
little
old
man
with
a
scanty
grizzled
beard
and
weary,
good-natured
eyes,
was
standing
at
the
altar.

over
the
pages
of

With
a
slight
bow
to
Levin
he
began
immediately
reading
prayers
in
the
official
voice.
When
he
had
finished
them
he
bowed
down
to
the
ground
and
turned,
facing
Levin.
"Christ
is
present
here
unseen,
receiving
your
confession,"
he
said,
pointing
to
the
crucifix.
"Do
you
believe
in
all
the
doctrines

Holy
Apostolic
Churches
the
priest
went
on,
turning
his
eyes
away
from
Levin's
face
and
folding
his
hands
under
his
stole.
"I
have
doubted,
I
doubt
everything,"
said
Levin
in
a
voice
that
jarred
on
himself,
and
he
ceased
speaking.
The
priest
waited
a
few
seconds
to
see
if
he
would
not
say
more,
and
closing
his
eyes
he
said
quickly,
with
a
broad,

accent:
"Doubt

but

he
added,
without
the
slightest
interval,
as
though
anxious
not
to
waste
time.
"My
chief
sin
is

I
have
doubts

everything,
and
for
the
most
part
I
am
in

"Doubt

natural
to
the

the
priest
repeated
the
same
words.
"What

"I
doubt
of
everything.
I
sometimes
even
have
doubts
of

Levin
could
not
help
saying,
and
he
was
horrified
at
the
impropriety
of
what
he
was
saying.
But
Levin's
words
did
not,
it
seemed,
make
much
impression
on
the
priest.
"What
sort
of
doubt
can
there
be
of
the
existence
of
God?"
he
said

with
a
just

Levin
did
not

"What

the
priest
went
on
in
the
rapid
customary
jargon.

he
said,
looking
inquiry
at
Levin.
Levin
felt
that
it
would
be
improper
to
enter
upon
a
metaphysical
discussion
with
the
priest,
and
so
he
said
in
reply
merely
what
was
a
direct
answer
to
the
question.
"I
don't
know,"
he
said.
"You
don't
know"
Then
how
can
you
doubt
that
God
created
all?"
the
priest
said,
with
good-humored
perplexity.
"I
don't
understand
it
at
all,"
said
Levin,
blushing.
and
feeling
that
his
words
were
stupid,
and
that
they
could
not
be
anything
but
stupid
in
such
a
position.
"Pray
to
God
and
beseeched
Him.
Even
the
holy
fathers
had
doubts,
and
prayed
to
God
to
strengthen

and
we
must
resist

he
repeated

The

paused
for

as

he
resumed,
with
a
smile.
"An
excellent
young
lady."
"Yes,"
answered
Levin,
blushing
for
the
priest.
"What
does
he
want
to
ask
me
about
this
at
confession
for?"
he
thought.
And,
as
though
answering
his
thought,
the
priest
said
to
him:
"You
are
about
to
enter
into
holy
matrimony,
and
God
may
bless
you
with

Well,

he
said,
and
he
stopped,
putting
his
head
on
one
side
and
looking
at
Levin
with
his
kindly,
gentle
eyes.
Levin
made
no
answer
this
time,
not
because
he
did
not
want
to
enter
upon
a
discussion
with
the
priest,
but
because,
so
far,
no
one
had
ever
asked
him
such
questions,
and
when
his
babes
did
ask
him
those
questions,
it
would
be
time
enough
to
think
about
answering
them.
"You
are
entering
upon
a
time
of
life,"
pursued
the
priest,
"when
you
must
choose
your
path
and
keep
to
it.
Pray
to
God
that
He
may
in
His
mercy
aid
you
and
have
mercy

you!"
he
concluded.
"Our
Lord
and
God,
Jesus
Christ,

abundance
and
riches
of
His
lovingly
forgives
this
child/worker
and,
finishing
the
prayer
of
absolution,
the
priest
blessed
him
and
dismissed
him.
On
getting
home
that
day,
Levin
had
a
delightful
sense
of
relief
at
the
awkward
position
being
over
and
having
been
got
through
without
his
having
to
tell
a
lie.
Apart
from
this,
there
remained
a
vague
memory
that
what
the
kind,
nice
old
fellow
had
said
had
not
been
at
all
so
stupid
as
he
had
fancied
at
first,
and
that
there
was
something
in
it
that
must
be
cleared
up.
"Of
course,
not
now,"
thought
Levin,
"but
some
day
later
on."
Levin
felt
more
than
ever
now
that
there
was
something
not
clear
and
not
clean
in
his
soul,
and
that,
in
regard
to
religion,
he
was
in
the
same
position
which
he
perceived
so
clearly
and
disliked
in
others,
and
for
which
he
blamed
his
friend
Svider.
Levin
spent
that
evening
with
his
betrothed
at
Dolly,
and
was
in
very
high
spirits.
To
explain
to
Stepan
Arkalyk
the
state
of
excitement
in
which
he
found
himself,
he
said
that
he
was
happy
like
a
dog
being
trained
to
jump
through
a
hoop,
who,
having
at
last
caught
the
idea,
and
done
what
was
required
of
him,
whines
and
wags
its
tail,
and
jumps
up
to
the
table
and
the
windows
in
its
delight.

said
Tchoupitoulas
"Well,
you
must
go
and
get
them
without

"Ah,

said
Sergey
Ivanovo.
"And

may

good-bye

Levin
smiled.
The
picture
of
his
wife
not
letting
him
go
was
so
pleasant
that
he
was
ready
to
renounce
the
delights
of
looking
upon
bears
forever.
"Still,
it's
a
pity
they
should
get
those
two

without

remember

said
Tchoupitoulas
Levin
had
not
the
heart
to
disillusion
him
of
the
notion
that
there
could
be
something
delightful
apart
from
her,
and
so
said
nothing.
"There's
some
sense
in
this
custom
of
saying
good-bye
to
bachelor
life,"
said
Sergey
Ivanovo.
"However
happy
you
may
be,
you
must
regret
your

"And
confess
there
is
a

said
Katawazi
and
he
broke
into
loud
laughter.
"Oh,

"Well,
now,
on
my
honor,"
said
Levin,
smiling,
"I
can't
find
in
my
heart
that
feeling
of
regret
for
my
freedom."
"Yes,
there's
such
a
chaos
in
your
heart
just
now
that
you
can't
find
anything

said
Katawazi
"Wait

you

"Nobel

Soon
after
dinner
the
guests
went
away
to
be
in
time
to
be
dressed
for
the
wedding.
When
he
was
left
alone,
and
recalled
the
conversation
of
these
bachelor
friends,
Levin
asked
himself:
had
he
in
his
heart
that
regret
for
his
freedom
of
which
they
had
spokes
He
smiled
at
the
question.
"Freedom!
What
is
freedom
for?
Happiness
is
only
in
loving
and
wishing
her
wishes,
thinking
her
thoughts,
that
is
to
say,
not

"But

some
voice
suddenly
whispered
to
him.
The
smile
died
away
from
his
face,
and
he
grew
thoughtful.
And
suddenly
a
strange
feeling
came
upon
him.
There
came
over
him
a
dread
and
doubt.
of
everything.
"What
if
she
does
not
love
me?
What
if
she's
marrying
me
simply
to
be
married?"
What
if
she
doesn't
see
herself
what
she's
doing?"
he
asked
himself.
"She
may
come
to
her
senses,
and
only
when
she
is
being
married
realize
that
she
does
not
and
cannot
love
me."
And
strange,
most
evil
thoughts
of
her
began
to
come
to
him.
He
was
jealous
of
Vrye
as
he
had
been
a
year
ago,
as
though
the
evening
he
had
seen
her
with
Vrye
had
been
yesterday.
He
suspected
she
had
not
told
him
everything.
He
jumped
up
quickly.
"No,
this
can't
go
on!"
he
said
to
himself
in
despair.
"I'll
go
to
her;
I'll
ask
her;
I'll
say
for
the
last
time:
we
are
free,
and
hadn't

so?
Anything?"
better
than
endless
misery,
disgrace,
unfamiliar
With
despair
in
his
heart
and
bitter
anger
against
all
men,
against
himself,
against
her,
he
went
out
of
the
hotel
and
drove
to
her
house.
He
found
her
in
one
of
the
back
rooms.
She
was
sitting
on
a
chest
and
making
some
arrangements
with
her
maid,
sorting
over
heaps
of
dresses
of
different
colors,
spread
on
the
backs
of
chairs
and
on
the
floor.
"Ah,

cried,
seeing
him,
and
beaming
with
delight.

"I

"Oh!

he
said
gloomy
looking
at
the
maid.
"You

I'll
call
you
presently,"
said
Kitty.
"Kotch"
what's
the
matter?"
she
asked,
definitely
adopting
this
familiar
name
as
soon
as
the
maid
had
gone
out.
She
noticed
his
strange
face,
agitated
and
gloomy,
and
a
panic
came
over
her.
"Kitty"
I'm
in
torture.
I
can't
suffer
alone,"
he
said
with
despair
in
his
voice,
standing
before
her
and
looking
imploringly
into
her
eyes.
He
saw
already
from
her
loving,
truthful
face,
that
nothing
could
come
of
what
he
had
meant
to
say,
but
yet
he
wanted
her
to
reassure
him
herself.
"I've
come
to
say
that
there's

can
all
be

and

"Whatever

"What

said,

answered,

"Yes,

"You're

she
cried,
turning
crimson
with

But
his

was
so

that
she
restrained

arm-flailing,
she
sat
down
beside
him.
"What

"I

What
can

"My

she
said,
and
burst
into
tears.
"Oh!
what
have
I
done?"
he
cried,
and
kneeling
before
her,
he
fell
to
kissing
her
hands.
When
the
princess
came
into
the
room
five
minutes
later,
she
found
them
completely
reconciled.
Kitty
had
not
simply
assured
him
that
she
loved
him,
but
had
gone
so
far-and-away
answer
to
his
question,
what
she
loved
him
for-hire
to
explain
what
for.
She
told
him
that
she
loved
him
because
she
understood
him
completely,
because
she
knew
what
he
would
like,
and
because
everything
he
liked
was
good.
And
this
seemed
to
him
perfectly
clear.
When
the
princess
came
to
them,
they
were
sitting
side
by
side
on
the
chest,
sorting
the
dresses
and
disputing
over
Kitty,
wanting
to

the
brown
dress

but

a

and

her:

worked

out."
Hearing
why
he
had
come,
the
princess
was
half

half
seriously
angry
with
him,
and
sent
him
home

Stepan

he
blessed

"Yes,"

Chapter
3
A
crowd
of
people,
principally
women,
was
thronging
round
the
church
lighted
up
for
the
wedding.
Those
who
had
not
succeeded
in
getting
into
the
main
entrance
were
crowding
about
the
windows,
pushing,
wrangling,
and
peeping
through
the
gratis
More
than
twenty
carriages
had
already
been
drawn
up
in
ranks
along
the
street
by
the
police.
A
police
officer,
regardless
of
the
frost,
stood
at
the
entrance,
gorgeous
in
his
uniform.
More
carriages
were
continually
driving
up,
and
ladies
wearing
flowers
and
carrying
their
trains,
and
men
taking
off
their
helmets
or
black
hats
kept
walking
into
the
church.
Inside
the
church
both

were
already
lighted,
and
all
the
candles
before
the
holy
pictures.

the

and

the
pictures,
and
the

the
lustful
and

and
the
stones
of
the
floor,
and
the
rugs,
and
the
banners
above
in
the
choir,
and
the
steps
of
the
altar,
and
the
old
blackened
books,
and
the
cassolette
and
surplus
were
flooded
with
light.
On
the
right
side
of
the
warm

in
the
crowd

and
white
ties,
uniforms
and
broaden
velvet,
satin,
hair
and
flowers,
bare
shoulders
and
arms
and
long
gloves,
there
was
discreet
but
lively
conversation
that
echoed
strangely
in
the
high
cupolas
Every
time
there
was
heard
the
creak
of
the
opened
door
the
conversation
in
the
crowd
died
away,
and
everybody
looked
round
expecting
to
see
the
bride
and
bridegroom
come
in.
But
the
door
had
opened
more
than
ten
times,
and
each
time
it
was
either
a
belated
guest
or
guests,
who
joined
the
circle
of
the
invited
on
the
right,
or
a
spectator,
who
had
eluded
or
softened
the
police
officer,
and
went
to
join
the
crowd
of
outsiders
on
the
left.
Both
the
guests
and
the
outside
public
had
by
now
passed
through
all
the
phases
of
anticipation.
At
first
they
imagined
that
the
bride
and
bridegroom
would
arrive
immediately,
and
attached
no
importance
at
all
to
their
being
late.
Then
they
began
to
look
more
and
more
often
towards
the
door,
and
to
talk
of
whether
anything
could
have
happened.
Then
the
long
delay
began
to
be
positively
discomforts
and
relations
and
guests
tried
to
look
as
if
they
were
not

of

were

as
though
to
remind
them
of
the
value
of
his

coughed
impatiently,
making
the

quiver
in
their
frames.
In
the
choir
the
bored
choristers
could
be
heard
trying
their
voices
and
blowing
their
noses.
The
priest
was
continually
sending
first
the
beads
and
then
the
deacon
to
find
out
whether
the
bridegroom
had
not
come,
more
and
more
often
he
went
himself,
in
a

and
an
embroidered
sash,
to

expecting
to
see
the
bridegrooms
At
last
one
of
the
ladies,
glancing
at
her
watch,
said,
"It
really
is
strange,

and
all
the
guests
became
uneasy
and
began
loudly
expressing
their
wonder
and
dissatisfaction.
One
of

men
went
to
find
out
what
had
happened.
Kitty
meanwhile
had
long
ago
been
quite
ready,
and
in
her
white
dress
and
long
veil
and
wreath
of
orange
blossoms
she
was
standing
in
the
drawing-room
of
the
Shtern
house
with
her
sister,
Madame
Lvovna.
who
was
her
bride
She
was
looking
out
of
the
window,
and
had
been
for
over
half
an
hour
anxiously
expecting
to
hear
from
the
best
man
that
her
bridegroom
was
at
the
church.
Levin
meanwhile,
in
his
trousers,
but
without
his
coat
and
waistcoats
was
walking
to
and
fro
in
his
room
at
the
hotel,
continually
putting
his
head
out
of
the
door
and
looking
up
and
down
the
corridor.
But
in
the
corridor
there
was
no
sign
of
the
person
he
was
looking
for
and
he
came
back
in
despair,
and
frantically
waving
his
hands
addressed
Stepan
Arkalyk
who
was
smoking
serenely.
"Was
ever
a
man
in
such
a
fearful
fool's
position?"
he
said.
"Yes,
it
is
stupid,"
Stepan
Arkalyk
assenting
smiling
soothingly.
"But
don't
worry,
it'll
be
brought
directly."
"No,
what
is
to
be
done!"
said
Levin,
with
smothered
fury.
"And
these
fools
of
open
waistcoats.
Out
of
the
question"
he
said,
looking
at
the
crumpled
front
of
his
shirt.
"And
what
if
the
things
have
been
taken
on
to
the
railway
station"
he
roared
in
desperation.
"Then
you
must
put
on
mine."
"I
ought
to
have
done
so
long
ago,
if
at
all."
"It's

point
was
that
when

asked
for
his
evening

Kouzmine
his
old
servant,
had
brought
him
the
coat,
waistcoats
and
everything
that
was
wanted.
"But
the

cried
Levin.
"You've
got
a
shirt
on,"
Kouzmine
answered,
with
a
placid
smile.
Kouzmine
had
not
thought
of
leaving
out
a
clean
shirt,
and
on
receiving
instructions
to
pack
up
everything
and
send
it

the
young
people
were

impossibly
wide
and
short.
They
sent
finally
to
the
Shtern
to
unpack,
the
things.
The
bridegroom
was
expected
at
the
church
while
he
was
pacing
up
and
down
his
room
like
a
wild
beast
in
a
cage,
peeping
out
into
the
corridor,
and
with
horror
and
despair
recalling
what
absurd
things
he
had
said
to
Kitty
and
what
she
might
be
thinking
now.
At
last
the
guilty
Kouzmine
flew
panting
into
the
room
with
the
shirt.
"Only
just
in
time.
They
were
just
lifting
it
into
the
van,"
said
Kouzmine
Three
minutes
later
Levin
ran
full
speed
into
the
corridor,
not
looking
at
his
watch
for
fear
of
aggravating
his
suffers
"You
won't
help
matters
like
this,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
with
a
smile,
hurrying
with
more
deliberation
after
him.
"It
will
come
round,
it
will
come
round
...
I
tell
you."

"They've

"Which
one?"
"Rather
young,

"Why,
my
dear
soul,
she
looks
more
dead
than
alive!"
were
the
comments
in
the
crowd,
when
Levin,
meeting
his
bride
in
the
entrance,
walked
with
her
into
the
church.
Stepan
Arkalyk
told
his
wife
the
cause
of
the
delay,
and
the
guests
were
whispering
it
with
smiles
to
one
another.
Levin
saw
nothing
and
no
one;
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
his
bride.
Everyone
said
she
had
lost
her
looks
dreadfully
of
late,
and
was
not
nearly
so
pretty
on
her
wedding
day
as
usual;
but
Levin
did
not
think
so.
He
looked
at
her
hair
done
up
high,
with
the
long
white
veil
and
white
flowers
and
the
high,
stand-up-and-fight
scalloped
collar,
that
in
such
a
maidens
fashion
hid
her
long
neck
at
the
sides
and
only
showed
it
in
front,
her
strikingly
slender
figure,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
looked
better
than
ever-attentive
because
these
flowers,
this
veil,
this
gown
from
Paris
added
anything
to
her
beauty;
but
because,
in
spite
of
the
elaborate
sumptuousness
of
her
attire,
the
expression
of
her
sweet
face,
of
her
eyes,
of
her
lips
was
still
her
own
characteristic
expression
of
guileless
truthfulness.
"I
was
beginning
to
think
you
meant
to
run
away,"
she
said,
and
smiled
to
him.
"It's
so
stupid,
what
happened
to
me,
I'm
ashamed
to
speak
of
it!"
he
said,
reddening,
and
he
was
obliged
to
turn
to
Sergey
Ivanovo.
who
came
up
to
him.
"This
is
a
pretty
story
of
yours
about
the
shirt"
said
Sergey
Ivanovo.
shaking
his
head
and
smiling.
"Yes,
yes!"
answered
Levin,
without
an
idea
of
what
they
were
talking
about.
"Now,
Kostyra,
you
have
to
decide,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
with
an
air
of
mock
dismay,
"a
weighty
question.
You
are
at
this
moment
just
in
the
humor
to
appreciate
all
its
gravity.
They
ask
me,
are
they

candles

It's

he
added,
relaxing
his
lips
into
a
smile.
"I
have
decided,
but
I
was
afraid
you
might
not
agree."
Levin
saw
it
was
a
joke,
but
he
could
not
smile.
"Well,
how's
it
to
be
thence
or

that's
the
question."
"Yes,
yes,
unlikable
"Oh,
I'm
very
glade
The
question's

said
Stepan
Arkalyk
smiling.
"How
silly
men
are,
though,
in
this
position,"
he
said
to
Tchoupitoulas
when
Levin,
after
looking
absently
at
him,
had
moved
back
to
his
bride.
"Klansas
mind
you're
the
first
to
step
on
the
carpet,'
said
Countess
Nordstorm
coming
up.
"You're
a
nice
person"
she
said
to
Levin.
"Aren't
you
frightened,
eight
said
Maryam
Dmitrin
an
old
aunt.
"Are
you
colder
You're
pale.
Stop
a
minute,
stoop
down,"
said
Kitty,
sister,
Madame
Lvovna.
and
with
her
plump,
handsome
arms
she
smilingly
set
straight
the
flowers
on
her
head.
Dolly
came
up,
tried
to
say
something,
but
could
not
speak,
cried,
and
then
laughed
unnaturally.
Kitty
looked
at
all
of
them
with
the
same
absent
eyes
as
Levin.
Meanwhile
the
officiating
clergy
had
got
into
their
vestments,
and
the
priest
and
deacon
came
out
to
the
lectern,
which
stood
in
the
forepeak,
of
the
church.
The
priest
turned
to
Levin
saying
something.
Levin
did
not
hear
what
the
priest
said.
"Take
the
bride's
hand
and
lead
her
up,"
the
best
man
said
to
Levin.
It
was
a
long
while
before
Levin
could
make
out
what
was
expected
of
him.
For
a
long
time
they
tried
to
set
him
right
and
made
him
begin
again.
he
kept
taking
Kitty
by
the
wrong
arm
or
with
the
wrong
arm-and-arm
he
understood
at
last
that
what
he
had
to
do
was,
without
changing
his
position,
to
take
her
right
hand
in
his
right
hand.
When
at
last
he
had
taken
the
bride's
hand
in
the
correct
way,
the
priest
walked
a
few
paces
in
front
of
them
and
stopped
at
the
lectern.
The
crowd
of
friends
and
relations
moved
after
them,
with
a
buzz
of
talk
and
a
rustle
of
skirts.
Someone
stooped
down
and
pulled
out
the
bride's
train.
The
church
became
so
still
that
the
drops
of
wax
could
be
heard
falling
from
the
candles.
The
little
old
priest
in
his
ecclesiastical
cap,
with
his
long
silvery-white
locks
of
hair
parted
behind
his
ears,
was
fumbling
with
something
at
the
lectern,
putting
out
his
little
old
hands
from
under
the
heavy
silver
vestments
with
the
gold
cross
on
the
back
of
it.
Stepan
Arkalyk
approached
him
cautiously,
whispered
something,
and
making
a
sign
to
Levin,
walked
back
again.
The
priest
lighted
two
candles,
wreathed
with
flowers,
and
holding
them
sideways
so
that
the
wax
dropped
slowly
from
them
he
turned,
facing
the
bridal
pair.
The
priest
was
the
same
old
man
that
had
confessed
Levin.
He
looked
with
weary
and
melancholy
eyes
at
the
bride
and
bridegrooms
sighed,
and
putting
his
right
hand
out
from
his
vestments
blessed
the
bridegroom
with
it,
and
also
with
a
shade
of
solicitous
tenderness
laid
the
crossed
fingers
on
the
bowed
head
of
Kitty.
Then
he
gave
them
the
candles,
and
taking
the
censor
moved
slowly
away
from
them.
"Can
it
be
true?"
thought
Levin,
and
he
looked
round
at
his
bride.
Looking
down
at
her
he
saw
her
face
in
profile,
and
from
the
scarcely
perceptible
quiver
of
her
lips
and
eyelashes,
he
knew
she
was
aware
of
his
eyes
upon
her.
She
did
not
look
round,
but
the
high
scalloped
collar,
that
reached
her
little
pink
ear,
trembled
faintly.
He
saw
that
a
sigh
was
held
back
in
her
throat,
and
the
little
hand
in
the
long
glove
shook
as
it
held
the
candle.
All
the
fuss
of
the
shirt,
of
being
late,
all
the
talk
of
friends
and
relations,
their
annoyance,
his
ludicrous
position-evening
suddenly
passed
away
and
he
was
filled
with
joy
and
dread.
The
handsome,
stately
head-disk
wearing
a
silver
robe
and
his
curly
locks
standing
out
at
each
side
of
his
head,
stepped
smartly
forward,
and
lifting
his
stole
on
two
fingers,
stood
opposite
the
priest.
"Blessed
be
the
name
of
the
Lord,"
the
solemn
syllables
rang
out
slowly
one
after
another,
setting
the
air
quivering
with
waves
of
sound.
"Blessed
is
the
name
of
our
God,
from
the
beginning,
is
now,
and
ever
shall
be,"
the
little
old
priest
answered
in
a
submissiveness
piping
voice,
still
fingering
something
at
the
lectern.
And
the
full
chorus
of
the
unseen
choir
rose
up,
filling
the
whole
church,
from
the
windows
to
the
vaulted
roof,
with
broad
waves
of
melody.
It
grew
stronger,
rested
for
an
instant,
and
slowly
died
away.
They
prayed,
as
they
always
do,
for
peace
from
on
high
and
for
salvation,
for
the
Holy
Synod,
and
for
the
Tsarandoy
they
prayed,
too,
for
the
servants
of
God,
Konstantin
and
Ekaterinburg.
now

their

love
made
perfect,
peace
and
help,
O
Lord,
we
beseeched
Thee,"
the
whole
church
seemed
to
breathe
with
the
voice
of
the
head
deacon.
Levin
heard
the
words,
and
they
impressed
him.
"How
did
they
guess
that
it
is
help,
just
help
that
one
war
he
thought,
recalling
all
his
fears
and
doubts
of
late.
"What
do
I
know?
what
can
I
do
in
this
fearful
business,"
he
thought,
"without
help?
Yes,
it
is
help
I
want
now."
When
the
deacon
had
finished
the
prayer
for
the
Imperial
family,
the
priest
turned
to
the
bridal
pair
with
a
book:
"Eternal
God,
that
joing
together
in
love
them
that
were
separate,"
he
read
in
a
gentle,
piping
voice:
"who
hastaken
ordained
the
union
of
holy
wedlock
that
cannot
be
set
asunder,"
Thou

and
Rebecca

to
Thy

Covenants

and
Ekaterinburg.
leading
them
in
the
path
of
all
good
works.
For
gracious
and
merciful

Though

the
Father,
the
Son,
and
the
Holy
Ghost,
now
and
ever

"Amen"
the
unseen
choir
sent
rolling
again
upon
the
air.
"'Maytag'
together
in
love
them
that
were
separate.'
What
deep
meaning
in
those
words,
and
how
they
correspond
with
what
one
feels
at
this
moment,"
thought
Levin.
"Is
she
feeling
the
same
as
I?"
And
looking
round,
he
met
her
eyes,
and
from
their
expression
he
concluded
that
she
was
understanding
it
just
as
he
was.
But
this
was
a
mistake?
she
almost
completely
missed
the
meaning
of
the
words
of
the
service;
she
had
not
heard
them,
in
fact.
She
could
not
listen
to
them
and
take
them
in,
so
strong
was
the
one
feeling
that
filled
her
breast
and
grew
stronger
and
stronger.
That
feeling
was
joy
at
the
completion
of
the
process
that
for
the
last
month
and
a
half
had
been
going
on
in
her
soul,
and
had
during
those
six
weeks
been
a
joy
and
a
torture
to
her.
On
the
day
when
in
the
drawing
room
of
the
house
in
Arbaz
Street
she
had
gone
up
to
him
in
her
brown
dress,
and
given
herself
to
him
without
a
word-by-word,
that
day,
at
that
hour,
there
took
place
in
her
heart
a
complete
severance
from
all
her
old
life,
and
a
quite
different,
new,
utterly
strange
life
had
begun
for
her,
while
the
old
life
was
actually
going
on
as
before.
Those
six
weeks
had
for
her
been
a
time
of
the
utmost
bliss
and
the
utmost
misery.
All
her
life,
all
her
desires
and
hopes
were
concentrated
on
this
one
man,
still
uncomprehending
by
her,
to
whom
she
was
bound
by
a
feeling
of
alternate
attraction
and
repulsion,
even
less
comprehending
than
the
man
himself,
and
all
the
while
she
was
going
on
living
in
the
outward
conditions
of
her
old
life.
Living
the
old
life,
she
was
horrified
at
herself,
at
her
utter
insurmountable
callousness
to
all
her
own
past,
to
things,
to
habits,
to
the
people
she
had
loved,
who
loved
her.
her
mother,
who
was
wounded
by
her
indifference,
to
her
kind,
tender
father,
till
then
dearer
than
all
the
world.
At
one
moment
she
was
horrified
at
this
indifference,
at
another
she
rejoiced
at
what
had
brought
her
to
this
indifference.
She
could
not
frame
a
thought,
not
a
wish
apart
from
life
with
this
man;
but
this
new
life
was
not
yet,
and
she
could
not
even
picture
it
clearly
to
herself.
There
was
only
anticipation,
the
dread
and
joy
of
the
new
and
the
unknown.
And
now
behold.
and
uncertainty
and
remorse
at
the
abandonment
of
the
old
life-altering
was
ending,
and
the
new
was
beginning.
This
new
life
could
not
but
have
terrors
for
her
inexperienced
but,
terrible
or
not,
the
change
had
been
wrought
six
weeks
before
in
her
soul,
and
this
was
merely
the
final
sanction
of
what
had
long
been
completed
in
her
heart.
Turning
again
to
the
lectern,
the
priest
with
some
difficulty
took
Kitty,
little
ring,
and
asking
Levin
for
his
hand,
put
it
on
the
first
joint
of
his
finger.
"The
servant
of
God,
Konstantin,
plights
his
troth,
to
the
servant
of
God,
Ekaterinburg.
And
putting
his
big
ring
on
Kitty,
touchingly
weak,
pink
little
finger,
the
priest
said
the
same
thing.
And
the
bridal
pair
tried
several
times
to
understand
what
they
had
to
do,
and
each
time
made
some
mistake
and
were
corrected
by
the
priest
in
a
whisper.
At
last,
having
duly
performed
the
ceremony,
having
signed
the
rings
with
the
cross,
the
priest
handed
Kitty
the
big
ring,
and
Levin
the
little
one.
Again
they
were
puzzled,
and
passed
the
rings
from
hand
to
hand,
still
without
doing
what
was
expected.
Dolly,
Tchoupitoulas
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
stepped
forward
to
set
them
right.
There
was
an
interval
of
hesitation,
whispering,
and
smiley
but
the
expression
of
solemn
emotion
on
the
faces
of
the
betrothed
pair
did
not
change:
on
the
contrary,
in
their
perplexity
over
their
hands
they
looked
more
grave
and
deeply
moved
than
before,
and
the
smile
with
which
Stepan
Arkalyk
whispered
to
them
that
now
they
would
each
put
on
their
own
ring
died
away
on
his
lips.
He
had
a
feeling
that
any
smile
would
jar
on
them.
"Thou
who
die
from
the
beginning

and

the
priest
read
after
the
exchange
of

Levin
felt
more
and
more
that
all
his
ideas
of
marriage,
all
his
dreams
of
how
he
would
order
his
life,
were
mere

that
it
was
something
he
had
not

hitherto,
and
now
understood
less
than

though

was

performed

The

in

rose
higher
and
higher,
tears

would
not
be
checked
came
into
his
eyes.

In

in

there
was
an
incessant

talk
in
the
circle

gaily
dressed
women
and
girls,
and
men
in
white
ties,
frocks
and

The
talk
was

while
the

were
absorbed
in
watching

detail
of

always

them.
In

and
how
different
it
all
was
now.
"They

anyone's

than
ten
times,
he'll
never
be
married.
I
wanted
to

said
Count
Sinicize
to
the
pretty
Princess
Tchegodar
who
had
designs
on
him.
Princess
Tchegodar
only
answered
with
a
smile.
She
looked
at
Kitty,
thinking
how
and
when
she
would

with

how
she
would

of

the

"She

be
of
the

jests
assuring
her
that
the
custom
of
going
away
after
the
wedding
was
becoming
common
because
newly
married
people
always
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
themselves.
"Your
brother
may
feel
proud
of
himself.
She's
a
marvel
of
sweetness.
I
believe
you're
envious.'
"Oh,
I've

over
that,
Darya

he
answered,
and
a
melancholy
and
serious
expression
suddenly
came
over
his
face.
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
telling
his
sister-in-law
his
joke
about
divorce.
"The
wreath
wants

she
answered,
not
hearing
him.
"What
a
pity
she's
lost
her

so,"
Countess
Nordstorm
said
to
Madame
Lvovna.
"Still
he's
not

he?"
"Oh,

Madame

It's
so
difficult,
too,
to
look
well
in
such
a
position,
not
to
be
ridiculous.
And
he's
not
ridiculous,
and
not
affected;
one
can
see
he's
moved."
"You

I
supposed

"Well,

Madame

she
heard
them,
but
she
did
not
answer.
She
was
deeply
moved.
The
tears
stood
in
her
eyes,
and
she
could
not
have
spoken
without
crying.
She
was
rejoicing
over
Kitty
and
Levindale
going
back
in
thought
to
her
own
wedding,
she
glanced
at
the
radiant
figure
of
Stepan
Arkalyk
forgot
all
the
present,
and
remembered
only
her
own
innocent
love.
She
recalled
not
herself
only,
but
all
her
women-in-medicine
and
acquaintances.
She
thought
of
them
on
the
one
day
of
their
triumph,
when
they
had
stood
like
Kitty
under
the
wedding
crown,
with
love
and
hope
and
dread
in
their
hearts,
renouncing
the
past,
and
stepping
forward
into
the
mysterious
future.
Among
the
brides
that
came
back
to
her
memory,
she
thought
too
of
her
darling
Anna,
of
whose
proposed
divorce
she
had
just
been
hearing.
And
she
had
stood
just
as
innocent
in
orange
flowers
and
bridal
veil.
And
now?
"It's
terribly
strange,"
she
said
to
herself.
It
was
not
merely
the
sisters,
the
women-in-medicine
and
female
relations
of
the
bride
who
were
following
every
detail
of
the
ceremony.
Women
who
were
quite
strangers,
mere
spectators,
were
watching
it
excitedly.

their

in

often

the

Chapter
6
When
the
ceremony
of
plights
troth,
was
over,
the
beads
spread
before
the
lectern
in
the
middle
of
the
church
a
piece
of
pink
silken
stuff,
the
choir
sang
a
complicated
and
elaborate
psalms
in
which
the
bass
and
tenor
sang
responses
to
one
another,
and
the
priest
turning
round
pointed
the
bridal
pair
to
the
pink
silk
rug.
Though
both
had
often
heard
a
great
deal
about
the
saying
that
the
one
who
steps
first
on
the
rug
will
be
the
head
of
the
house,
neither
Levin
nor
Kitty
were
capable
of
recollection
it,
as
they
took
the
few
steps
towards
it.
They
did
not
hear
the
loud
remarks
and
disputes
that
followed,
some
maintaining
he
had
stepped
on
first,
and
others
that
both
had
stepped
on
together.
After
the
customary
questions,
whether
they
desired
to
enter
upon
matrimony,
and
whether
they
were
pledged
to
anyone
else,
and
their
answers,
which
sounded
strange
to
themselves,
a
new
ceremony
began.
Kitty
listened
to
the
words
of
the
prayer,
trying
to
make
out
their
meaning,
but
she
could
not.
The
feeling
of
triumph
and
radiant
happiness
flooded
her
soul
more
and
more
as
the
ceremony
went
on,
and
deprived
her
of
all
power
of
attention.
They

they
prayed
that

and
Zippy
and
that
they

"That's

thought
Kitty,
catching
the
words,
"all
that's
just
as
it
should
be,"
and
a
smile
of
happiness,
unconsciously
reflected
in
everyone
who
looked
at
her,
beamed
on
her
radiant
face.

she
whispered.
smiling.
Levin
looked
round
at
her,
and
was
struck
by
the
joyful
radiance
on
her
face,
and
unconsciously
her
feeling
infected
him.
He
too,
like
her
felt
glad
and
happy.
They
enjoyed
hearing
the
epistle
read,
and
the
roll
of
the
head
deacon.

the
last
verse,

with
such
impatience

the

They
enjoyed
drinking
out
of
the
shallow
cup
of
warm
red
wine
and
water,
and
they
were
still
more
pleased
when
the
priest,
flinging
back
his
stole
and
taking
both
their
hands
in
his,
led
them
round
the
lectern
to
the
accompaniment
of
bass
voices
chanting
"Glory
to
God."
Shtern
and
Tchoupitoulas
supporting
the
crowns
and
stumbling
over
the
bride's
train,
smiling
too
and
seeming
delighted
at
something,
were
at
one
moment
left
behind,
at
the
next
treading
on
the
bridal
pair
as
the
priest
came
to
a
halt.
The
spark
of
joy
kindled
in
Kitty
seemed
to
have
infected
everyone
in
the
church.
It
seemed
to
Levin
that
the
priest
and
the
deacon
too
wanted
to
smile
just
as
he
did.
Taking
the
crowns
off
their
heads
the
priest
read
the
last
prayer
and
congratulated
the
young
people.
Levin
looked
at
Kitty,
and
he
had
never
before
seen
her
look
as
she
did.
She
was
charming
with
the
new
radiance
of
happiness
in
her
face.
Levin
longed
to
say
something
to
her,
but
he
did
not
know
whether
it
was
all
over.
The
priest
got
him
out
of
his
difficulty.
He
smiled
his
kindly
smile
and
said
gently,
"Kiss
your
wife,
and
you
kiss
your
husband,"
and
took
the
candles
out
of
their
hands.
Levin
kissed
her
smiling
lips
with
timid
care,
gave
her
his
arm,
and
with
a
new
strange
sense
of
closeness,
walked
out
of
the
church.
He
did
not
believe,
he
could
not
believe,
that
it
was
true.
It
was
only
when
their
wondering
and
timid
eyes
met
that
he
believed
in
it,
because
he
felt
that
they
were
one.
After
supper,
the
same
night,
the
young
people
left
for
the
country.
Chapter
7
Vrye
and
Anna
had
been
traveling
for
three
months
together
in
Europe.
They
had
visited
Venice,
Rome,
and
Naples,
and
had
just
arrived
at
a
small
Italian
town
where
they
meant
to
stay
some
time.
A
handsome
head
waiter,
with
thick
pomades
hair
parted
from
the
neck
upwards,
an
evening
coat,
a
broad
white
camcorder
shirt
front,
and
a
bunch
of
trinkets
hanging
above
his
rounded
stomach,
stood
with
his
hands
in
the
full
curve
of
his
pockets,
looking
contemptuously
from
under
his
eyelids
while
he
gave
some
frigid
reply
to
a
gentleman
who
had
stopped
him.
Catching
the
sound
of
footsteps
coming
from
the
other
side
of
the
entry
towards
the
staircase,
the
head
waiter
turned
round,
and
seeing
the
Russian
count,
who
had
taken
their
best
rooms,
he
took
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
null
and
with
a
bow
informed
him
that
a
courier
had
been,
and
that
the
business
about
the
palazzo
had
been
arranged.
The
steward
was
prepared
to
sign
the
agreement.
"Ah!
I'm
glad
to
hear
it,"
said
Vrye
"Is
madame
at
home
or
not?"
"Madame
has
been
out
for
a
walk
but
has
returned
now,"
answered
the
waiter.
Vrye
took
off
his
soft,
wide-brimmed
hat
and
passed
his
handkerchief
over
his
heated
brow
and
hair,
which
had
grown
half
over
his
ears,
and
was
brushed
back
covering
the
bald
patch
on
his
head.
And
glancing
casually
at
the
gentleman,
who
still
stood
there
gazing
intently
at
him,
he
would
have
gone
on.
"This
gentleman
is
a
Russian,
and
was
inquiring
after
you,"
said
the
head
waiter.
With
mingled
feelings
of
annoyance
at
never
being
able
to
get
away
from
acquaintances
anywhere,
and
longing
to
find
some
sort
of
diversion
from
the
monotony
of
his
life,
Vrye
looked
once
more
at
the
gentleman,
who
had
retreated
and
stood
still
again,
and
at
the
same
moment
a
light
came
into
the
eyes
of
both.
"Golf
"Vue
It
really
was
Goler
a
comrade
of
Vrye
in
the
Corps
of
Pages.
In
the
corps
Goler
had
belonged
to
the
liberal
party;
he
left
the
corps
without
entering
the
army,
and
had
never
taken
office
under
the
government.
Vrye
and
he
had
gone
completely
different
ways
on
leaving
the
corps,
and
had
only
met
once
since.
At
that
meeting
Vrye
perceived
that
Goler
had
taken
up
a
sort
of
lofty,
intellectually
liberal
line,
and
was
consequently
disposed
to
look
down
upon
Vrye
interests
and
calling
in
life.
Hence
Vrye
had
met
him
with
the
chilling
and
haughty
manner
he
so
well
knew
how
to
assume,
the
meaning
of
which
was:
"You
may
like
or
dislike
my
way
of
life,
that's
a
matter
of
the
most
perfect
indifference
to
me;
you
will
have
to
treat
me
with
respect
if
you
want
to
know
me."
Goler
had
been
contemptuously
indifferent
to
the
tone
taken
by
Vrye
This
second
meeting
might
have
been
expected,
one
would
have
supposed,
to
estranged
them
still
more.
But
now
they
beamed
and
exclaimed
with
delight
on
recognizing
one
another.
Vrye
would
never
have
expected
to
be
so
pleased
to
see
Goler
but
probably
he
was
not
himself
aware
how
bored
he
was.
He
forgot
the
disagreeable
impression
of
their
last
meeting,
and
with
a
face
of
frank
delight
held
out
his
hand
to
his
old
comrade;
The
same
expression
of
delight
replaced
the
look
of
uneasiness
on
Goler
face.
"How
glad
I
am
to
meet
you!"
said
Vrye
showing
his
strong
white
teeth
in
a
friendly
smile.
"I
heard
the
name
Vrye
but
I
didn't
know
which
one.
I'm
very,
very
glade
"Let's
go
in.
Come,
tell
me
what
you're
doing."
"I've
been
living
here
for
two
years.
I'm
working."
"Ah,
said
Vrye
with
sympatisch.
"let's
go
in."
And
with
the
habit
common
with
Russians,
instead
of
saying
in
Russian
what
he
wanted
to
keep
from
the
servants,
he
began
to
speak
in
French.
"Do
you
know
Madame
Karennis
We
are
traveling
together.
I
am
going
to
see
her
now,"
he
said
in
French,
carefully
scrutinizing
Goler
face.
"Ah!
I
did
not
know"
(though
he
did
know).
Goler
answered
carelessly.
"Have
you
been
here
long?"
he
added.
"Four
days,"
Vrye
answered,
once
more
scrutinizing
his
friend's
face
intently.
"Yes,
he's
a
decent
fellow,
and
will
look
at
the
thing
properly,"
Vrye
said
to
himself,
catching
the
significance
of
Goler
face
and
the
change
of
subject.
"I
can
introduce
him
to
Anna,
he
looks
at
it
properly."
During
those
three
months
that
Vrye
had
spent
abroad
with
Anna,
he
had
always
on
meeting
new
people
asked
himself
how
the
new
person
would
look
at
his
relations
with
Anna,
and
for
the
most
part,
in
men,
he
had
met
with
the
"proper"
way
of
looking
at
it.
But
if
he
had
been
asked,
and
those
who
looked
at
it
"properly"
had
been
asked,
exactly
how
they
did
look
at
it,
both
he
and
they
would
have
been
greatly
puzzled
to
answer.
In
reality,
those
who
in
Vrye
opinion
had
the
"proper"
view
had
no
sort
of
view
at
all,
but
behaved
in
general
as
well-bred
persons
do
behave
in
regard
to
all
the
complex
and
insoluble
problems
with
which
life
is
encompassed
on
all
sides;
they
behaved
with
propriety,
avoiding
allusions
and
unpleasant
questions.
They
assumed
an
air
of
fully
comprehending
the
import
and
force
of
the
situation,
of
accepting
and
even
approving
of
it,
but
of
considering
it
superfluous
and
uncalled
for
to
put
all
this
into
words.
Vrye
at
once
divinely
that
Goler
was
of
this
class,
and
therefore
was
doubly
pleased
to
see
him.
And
in
fact,
Goler
manner
to
Madame
Karennis
when
he
was
taken
to
call
on
her,
was
all
that
Vrye
could
have
desired.
Obviously
without
the
slightest
effort
he
steered
clear
of
all
subjects
which
might
lead
to
embarrassment.
He
had
never
met
Anna
before,
and
was
struck
by
her
beauty,
and
still
more
by
the
frankness
with
which
she
accepted
her
position.
She
blushed
when
Vrye
brought
in
Goler
and
he
was
extremely
charmed
by
this
childish
blush
overstaffed
her
candid
and
handsome
face.
But
what
he
liked
particularly
was
the
way
in
which
at
once,
as
though
on
purpose
that
there
might
be
no
misunderstanding
with
an
outsider,
she
called
Vrye
simply

and
said
they
were
moving
into
a
house
they
had
just
taken,
what
was
here
called
a
palazzo.
Goler
liked
this
direct
and
simple
attitude
to
her
own
position.
Looking
at
Anna's
manner
of
simple-living
spirited
gaiety.
and
knowing
Alexey
Alexei
and
Vrye
Goler
fancied
that
he
understood
her
perfectly.
He
fancied
that
he
understood
what
she
was
utterly
unable
to
understand:
how
it
was
that,
having
made
her
husband
wretched,
having
abandoned
him
and
her
son
and
lost
her
good
name,
she
yet
felt
full
of
spirits,
gaiety.
and
happiness.
"It's
in
the
guide-posts
said
Goler
referring
to
the
palazzo
Vrye
had
taken.
"There's
a
first-rate
Tintoretto,
there.
One
of
his
latest
period."
"I
tell
you
what?
it's
a
lovely
day,
let's
go
and
have
another
look
at
it,"
said
Vrye
addressing
Anna.
"I
shall
be
very
glad
to;
I'll
go
and
put
on
my
hat.
Would
you
say
it's
hot?"
she
said,
stopping
short
in
the
doorway
and
looking
inquiry
at
Vrye
And
again
a
vivid
flush
overstaffed
her
face.
Vrye
saw
from
her
eyes
that
she
did
not
know
on
what
terms
he
cared
to
be
with
Goler
and
so
was
afraid
of
not
behaving
as
he
would
wish.
He
looked
a
long,
tender
look
at
her.
"No,
not
very-low
he
said.
And
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
understood
everything,
most
of
all,
that
he
was
pleased
with
her;
and
smiling
to
him,
she
walked
with
her
rapid
step
out
at
the
door.
The
friends
glanced
at
one
another,
and
a
look
of
hesitation
came
into
both
faces,
as
though
Goler
unmistakably
admiring
her,
would
have
liked
to
say
something
about
her,
and
could
not
find
the
right
thing
to
say,
while
Vrye
desired
and
dreaded
his
doing
so.
"Well
then,"
Vrye
began
to
start
a
conversation
of
some
sort;
"so
you're
settled
here?
You're
still
at
the
same
work,
then?"
he
went
on,
recalling
that
he
had
been
told
Goler
was
writing
something.
"Yes,
I'm
writing
the
second
part
of
the
_Two-thirds

said
Goler

with
pleasure
at
the

be
exact,

C
and
he
launched
into
a
long
and
heated
explanation
of
his
views.
Vrye
at
the
first
moment
felt
embarrassed
at
not
even
knowing
of
the
first
part
of
the
_Two-thirds
Elemeta,
of
which
the
author
spoke
as
something
well
known.
But
as
Goler
began
to
lay
down
his
opinions
and
Vrye
was
able
to
follow
them
even
without
knowing
the
_Two-thirds
Elemeta,
he
listened
to
him
with
some
interest,
for
Goler
spoke
well.
But
Vrye
was
startled
and
annoyed
by
the
nervous
irascibility,
with
which
Goler
talked
of
the
subject
that
engrossed
him.
As
he
went
on
talking,
his
eyes
glittered
more
and
more
angry
he
was
more
and
more
hurried
in
his
replies
to
imaginary
opponents,
and
his
face
grew
more
and
more
excited
and
worried.
Remembering
Goler
a
thin,
lively,
good-natured
and
well-bred
boy,
always
at
the
head
of
the
class,
Vrye
could
not
make
out
the
reason
of
his
irritability,
and
he
did
not
like
it.
What
he
particularly
disliked
was
that
Goler
a
man
belonging
to
a
good
set,
should
put
himself
on
a
level
with
some
scribbling
fellows,
with
whom
he
was
irritated
and
angry.
Was
it
worth
it?
Vrye
disliked
it,
yet
he
felt
that
Goler
was
unhappy,
and
was
sorry
for
him.
Unhappy
almost
mental
derbies
was
visible
on
his
mobile,
rather
handsome
face,
while
without
even
noticing
Anna's
coming
in,
he
went
on
hurriedly
and
hotly
expressing
his
views.
When
Anna
came
in
in
her
hat
and
cape,
and
her
lovely
hand
rapidly
swinging
her
parasol.
and
stood
beside
him,
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
relief
that
Vrye
broke
away
from
the
plaintive
eyes
of
Goler
which
fastened
persistently
upon
him,
and
with
a
fresh
rush
of
love
looked
at
his
charming
companion,
full
of
life
and
happiness.
Goler
recovered
himself
with
an
effort,
and
at
first
was
dejected
and
gloomy,
but
Anna,
disposed
to
feel
friendly
with
everyone
as
she
was
at
that
time,
soon
revived
his
spirits
by
her
direct
and
lively
manner.
After
trying
various
subjects
of
conversation,
she
got
him
upon
painting,
of
which
he
talked
very
well,
and
she
listened
to
him
attentively.
They
walked
to
the
house
they
had
taken,
and
looked
over
it.
"I
am
very
glad
of
one
thing,"
said
Anna
to
Goler
when
they
were
on
their
way
back,
"Alias
will
have
a
capital
_briefly
You
must
certainly
take

she
said
to
Vrye
in
Russian,
using
the
affectionately
familiar
form
as
though
she
saw
that
Goler
would
become
intimate
with
them
in
their
isolation,
and
that
there
was
no
need
of
reserve
before
him.
"Do
you

said
Goler
turning
round
quickly
to
Vrye
"Yes,
I
used
to
study
long
ago,
and
now
I
have
begun
to
do
a
little,"
said
Vrye
redder
"He
has
great
talent,"
said
Anna
with
a
delighted
smile.
"I'm
no
judge,
of
course.
But
good
judges
have
said
the
same."
Chapter
8
Anna,
in
that
first
period
of
her
emancipation
and
rapid
return
to
health,
felt
herself
unparliamentary
happy
and
full
of
the
joy
of
life.
The
thought
of
her
husband's
unhappiness
did
not
poison
her
happiness.
On
one
side
that
memory
was
too
awful
to
be
thought
of.
On
the
other
side
her
husband's
unhappiness
had
given
her
too
much
happiness
to
be
regretted.
The
memory
of
all
that
had
happened
after
her
illness:
her
reconciliation
with
her
husband,
its
breakdown,
the
news
of
Vrye
wound,
his
visit,
the
preparations
for
divorce,
the
departure
from
her
husband's
house,
the
parting
from
her
son-in
that
seemed
to
her
like
a
delirious
dream,
from
which
she
had
waked
up
alone
with
Vrye
abroad.
The
thought
of
the
harm
caused
to
her
husband
aroused
in
her
a
feeling
like
repulsion,
and
akin
to
what
a
drowning
man
might
feel
who
has
shaken
off
another
man
clinging
to
him.
That
man
did
drown.
It
was
an
evil
action,
of
course,
but
it
was
the
sole
means
of
escape,
and
better
not
to
brood
over
these
fearful
facts.
One
console
reflection
upon
her
conduct
had
occurred
to
her
at
the
first
moment
of
the
final
rupture,
and
when
now
she
recalled
all
the
past,
she
remembered
that
one
reflection.
"I
have
inevitably
made
that
man
wretchedly
she
thought;
"but
I
don't
want
to
profit
by
his
misery.
I
too
am
suffering,
and
shall
suffer;
I
am
losing
what
I
prized
above
everything-proof
am
losing
my
good
name
and
my
son.
I
have
done
wrong,
and
so
I
don't
want
happiness,
I
don't
want
a
divorce,
and
shall
suffer
from
my
shame
and
the
separation
from
my
child."
But,
however
sincerely
Anna
had
meant
to
suffer,
she
was
not
suffering.
Shame
there
was
not.
With
the
tact
of
which
both
had
such
a
large
share,
they
had
succeeded
in
avoiding
Russian
ladies
abroad,
and
so
had
never
placed
themselves
in
a
false
position,
and
everywhere
they
had
met
people
who
pretended
that
they
perfectly
understood
their
position,
far
better
indeed
than
they
did
themselves.
Separation
from
the
son
she
loved.
that
did
not
cause
her
anguish
in
these
early
days.
The
baby
girl-chasing
child-abuse
so
sweet,
and
had
so
won
Anna's
heart,
since
she
was
all
that
was
left
her,
that
Anna
rarely
thought
of
her
son.
The
desire
for
life,
waxing
stronger
with
recovered
health,
was
so
intense,
and
the
conditions
of
life
were
so
new
and
pleasant,
that
Anna
felt
unparliamentary
happy.
The
more
she
got
to
know
Vrye
the
more
she
loved
him.
She
loved
him
for
himself,
and
for
his
love
for
her.
Her
complete
ownership
of
him
was
a
continual
joy
to
her.
His
presence
was
always
sweet
to
her.
All
the
traits
of
his
character,
which
she
learned
to
know
better
and
better,
were
unuusal
dear
to
her.
His
appearance,
changed
by
his
civilian
dress,
was
as
fascinating
to
her
as
though
she
were
some
young
girl
in
love.
In
everything
he
said,
thought,
and
did,
she
saw
something
particularly
noble
and
elevated.
Her
adoration
of
him
alarmed
her
indeed;
she
sought
and
could
not
find
in
him
anything
not
fine.
She
dared
not
show
him
her
sense
of
her
own
insignificance
beside
him.
It
seemed
to
her
that,
knowing
this,
he
might
sooner
cease
to
love
her;
and
she
dreaded
nothing
now
so
much
as
losing
his
love,
though
she
had
no
grounds
for
fearing
it.
But
she
could
not
help
being
grateful
to
him
for
his
attitude
to
her,
and
showing
that
she
appreciated
it.
He,
who
had
in
her
opinion
such
a
marked
aptitude
for
a
political
career,
in
which
he
would
have
been
certain
to
play
a
leading
part-Moslem
had
sacrificed
his
ambition
for
her
sake,
and
never
betrayed
the
slightest
regret.
He
was
more
lovingly
respectful
to
her
than
ever,
and
the
constant
care
that
she
should
not
feel
the
awkwardness
of
her
position
never
deserted
him
for
a
single
instant.
He,
so
manly
a
man,
never
opposed
her,
had
indeed,
with
her,
no
will
of
his
own,
and
was
anxious,
it
seemed,
for
nothing
but
to
anticipate
her
wishes.
And
she
could
not
but
appreciate
this,
even
though
the
very
intensity
of
his
solicitude
for
her,
the
atmosphere
of
care
with
which
he
surrounded
her,
sometimes
weighed
upon
her.
Vrye
meanwhile,
in
spite
of
the
complete
realization
of
what
he
had
so
long
desired,
was
not
perfectly
happy.
He
soon
felt
that
the
realization
of
his
desires
gave
him
no
more
than
a
grain
of
sand
out
of
the
mountain
of
happiness
he
had
expected.
It
showed
him
the
mistake
men
make
in
picturing
to
themselves
happiness
as
the
realization
of
their
desires.
For
a
time
after
joining
his
life
to
hers,
and
putting
on
civilian
dress,
he
had
felt
all
the
delight
of
freedom
in
general
of
which
he
had
known
nothing
before,
and
of
freedom
in
his
love-affair
he
was
content,
but
not
for
long.
He
was
soon
aware
that
there
was
springing
up
in
his
heart
a
desire
for
desires.
Without
conscious
intention
he
began
to
clutch
at
every
passing
caprice.
taking
it
for
a
desire
and
an
object.
Sixteen
hours
of
the
day
must
be
occupied
in
some
way,
since
they
were
living
abroad
in
complete
freedom,
outside
the
conditions
of
social
life
which
filled
up
time
in
Petersburg.
As
for
the
amusements
of
bachelor
existence,
which
had
provided
Vrye
with
entertainment
on
previous
tours
abroad,
they
could
not
be
thought
of,
since
the
sole
attempt
of
the
sort
had
led
to
a
sudden
attack
of
depression
in
Anna,
quite
out
of
proportion
with
the

and

out
of
the
question
owing
to
the
irregularity
of
their
position.
The
inspection
of
objects
of
interest,
apart
from
the
fact
that
everything
had
been
seen
already,
had
not
for
Vrye
a
Russian
and
a
sensible
man,
the
immense
significance
Englishmen
are
able
to
attach
to
that
pursuit.
And
just
as
the
hungry
stomach
eagerly
accepts
every
object
it
can
get,
hoping
to
find
nourishment
in
it,
Vrye
quite
unconsciously
clutched
first
at
politics,
then
at
new
books,
and
then
at
pictures.
As
he
had
from
a
child
a
taste
for
painting,
and
as,
not
knowing
what
to
spend
his
money
on,
he
had
begun
collecting
engravings,
he
came
to
a
stop
at
painting,
began
to
take
interest
in
it,
and
concentrated
upon
it
the
unoccupied
mass
of
desires
which
demanded
satisfaction.
He
had
a
ready
appreciation
of
art,
and
probably,
with
a
taste
for
imitating
art,
he
supposed
himself
to
have
the
real
thing
essential
for
an
artist,
and
after
hesitating
for
some
time
which
style
of
painting
to
select.

or

set
to
work
to
paint.
He
appreciated
all
kinds,
and
could
have
felt
inspired
by
any
one
of
them;
but
he
had
no
conception
of
the
possibility
of
knowing
nothing
at
all
of
any
school
of
painting,
and
of
being
inspired
directly
by
what
is
within
the
soul,
without
caring
whether
what
is
painted
will
belong
to
any
recognized
school.
Since
he
knew
nothing
of
this,
and
drew
his
inspiration,
not
directly
from
life,
but
indirectly
from
life
embodied
in
art,
his
inspiration
came
very
quickly
and
easily,
and
as
quickly
and
easily
came
his
success
in
painting
something
very
similar
to
the
sort
of
painting
he
was
trying
to
imitate.
More
than
any
other
style
he
liked
the
French-Algerian
and

in
that
style
he
began
to
paint
Anna's
portrait
in
Italian
costume,
and
the
portrait
seemed
to
him,
and
to
everyone
who
saw
it,
extremely
successful.

palazzo
did
much,
by
its
very
appearance
after
they
had
moved
into
it,
to
confirm
in
Vrye
the
agreeable
illusion
that
he
was
not
so
much
a
Russian
country
gentleman,
a
retired
army
officer,
as
an
enlightened
amateur
and
patron
of
the
arts,
himself
a
modest
artist
who
had
renounced
the
world,
his
connections,
and
his
ambition
for
the
sake
of
the
woman
he
loved.
The
pose
chosen
by
Vrye
with
their
removal
into
the
palazzo
was
completely
successful,
and
having,
through
Goler
made
acquaintance
with
a
few
interesting
people,
for
a
time
he
was
satisfied.
He
painted
studies
from
nature
under
the
guidance
of
an
Italian
professor
of
painting,
and
studied
mediaeval
Italian
life.
Mediagenic
Italian
life
so
fascinated
Vrye
that
he
even
wore
a
hat
and
flung
a
cloak
over
his
shoulder
in
the
mediaeval
style,
which,
indeed,
was
extremely
becoming
to
him.
"Here
we
live,
and
know
nothing
of
what's
going
on,"
Vrye
said
to
Goler
as
he
came
to
see
him
one
morning.
"Have
you
seen
Mihailov,
picture?'
he
said,
handing
him
a
Russian
gazette
he
had
received
that
morning,
and
pointing
to
an
article
on
a
Russian
artist,
living
in
the
very
same
town,
and
just
finishing
a
picture
which
had
long
been
talked
about,
and
had
been
bought
beforehand.
The
article
reproached
the
government
and
the
academy
for
letting
so
remarkable
an
artist
be
left
without
encouragement
and
support.
"I've
seen
it,"
answered
Goler
"Of
course,
he's
not
without
talent,
but
it's
all
in
a
wrong
direction.
It's

and

"What
is
the

asked
Anna.
"Christ

Christ
is
represented
as
a
Jew
with
all
the
realism

school."
And
the
question
of
the
subject
of
the
picture
having
brought
him
to
one
of
his
favorite
theories,
Goler
launched
forth
into
a
disquisitions
on
it.
"I

The
artist
Mihailov,
was,
as
always,
at
work
when
the
cards
of
Count
Vrye
and
Goler
were
brought
to
him.
In
the
morning
he
had
been
working
in
his
studio
at
his
big
picture.
On
getting
home
he
flew
into
a
rage
with
his
wife
for
not
having
managed
to
put
off
the
landlady,
who
had
been
asking
for
money.

with
tears

and,
stopping
his

he
went

of

and
closed
the
door
after
him.
"Idomeneo"
woman"
he
said
to
himself,
sat
down
to
the
table,
and,
opening
a
portfolio,
he
set
to
work
at
once
with
peculiar
fervor
at
a
sketch
he
had
begun.
Never
did
he
work
with
such
fervor
and
success
as
when
things
went
ill
with
him,
and
especially
when
he
quarreled
with
his
wife.
"Oh!
damn
them
all!"
he
thought
as
he
went
on
working.
He
was
making
a
sketch
for
the
figure
of
a
man
in
a
violent
rage.
A
sketch
had
been
made
before,
but
he
was
dissatisfied
with
it.
"No,
that
one
was
better
...
where
is
it?"
He
went
back
to
his
wife,
and
scowls
and
not
looking
at
her,
asked
his
eldest
little
girl,
where
was
that
piece
of
paper
he
had
given
them?
The
paper
with
the
discarded
sketch
on
it
was
found,
but
it
was
dirty,
and
spotted
with
candle-light
Still,
he
took
the
sketch,
laid
it
on
his
table,
and,
moving
a
little
away,
screwing
up
his
eyes,
he
fell
to
gazing
at
it.
All
at
once
he
smiled
and
gesticulated
gleefully.
"That's
it!
that's
it!"
he
said,
and,
at
once
picking
up
the
pencil,
he
began
rapidly
drawing.
The
spot
of
tallow
had
given
the
man
a
new
pose.
He
had
sketched
this
new
pose,
when
all
at
once
he
recalled
the
face
of
a
shopkeeper
of
whom
he
had
bought
cigars,
a
vigorous
face
with
a
prominent
chin,
and
he
sketched
this
very
face,
this
chin
on
to
the
figure
of
the
man.
He
laughed
aloud
with
delight.
The
figure
from
a
lifeless
imagined
thing
had
become
living,
and
such
that
it
could
never
be
changed.
That
figure
lived,
and
was
clearly
and
unmistakably
defined.
The
sketch
might
be
corrected
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
figure,
the
legs,
indeed,
could
and
must
be
put
differently,
and
the
position
of
the
left
hand
must
be
quite
altered?
the
hair
too
might
be
thrown
back.
But
in
making
these
corrections
he
was
not
altering
the
figure
but
simply
getting
rid
of
what
concealed
the
figure.
He
was,
as
it
were,
stripping
off
the
wrappings
which
hindered
it
from
being
distinctly
seen.
Each
new
feature
only
brought
out
the
whole
figure
in
all
its
force
and
vigor,
as
it
had
suddenly
come
to
him
from
the
spot
of
tallow.
He
was
carefully
finishing
the
figure
when
the
cards
were
brought
him.
null
coming)
He
went
in
to
his
wife.
"Come,
Sasha,
don't
be
cross"
he
said,
smiling
timidly
and
affectionately
at
her.
"You
were
to
blame.
I
was
to
blame.
I'll
make
it
all
right."
And
having
made
peace
with
his
wife
he
put
on
an
olive-green
overcoat
with
a
velvet
collar
and
a
hat,
and
went
towards
his
studio.
The
successful
figure
he
had
already
forgotten.
Now
he
was
delighted
and
excited
at
the
visit
of
these
people
of
consequence,
Russians,
who
had
come
in
their
carriage.
Of
his
picture,
the
one
that
stood
now
on
his
easel,
he
had
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
one
conviction.
no
one
had
ever
painted
a
picture
like
it.
He
did
not
believe
that
his
picture
was
better
than
all
the
pictures
of
Raphael,
but
he
knew
that
what
he
tried
to
convey
in
that
picture,
no
one
ever
had
conveyed.
This
he
knew
positively,
and
had
known
a
long
while,
ever
since
he
had
begun
to
paint
it.
But
other
people's
criticisms,
whatever
they
might
be,
had
yet
immense
consequence
in
his
eyes,
and
they
agitated
him
to
the
depths
of
his
soul.
Any
remark,
the
most
insignificant,
that
showed
that
the
critic
saw
even
the
tiniest
part
of
what
he
saw
in
the
picture,
agitated
him
to
the
depths
of
his
soul.
He
always
attributed
to
his
critics
a
more
profound
comprehension
than
he
had
himself,
and
always
expected
from
them
something
he
did
not
himself
see
in
the
picture.
And
often
in
their
criticisms
he
fancied
that
he
had
found
this.
He
walked
rapidly
to
the
door
of
his
studio,
and
in
spite
of
his
excitement
he
was
struck
by
the
soft
light
on
Anna's
figure
as
she
stood
in
the
shade
of
the
entrance
listening
to
Goler
who
was
eagerly
telling
her
something,
while
she
evidently
wanted
to
look
round
at
the
artist.
He
was
himself
unconscious
how,
as
he
approached
them,
he
seized
on
this
impression
and
absorbed
it,
as
he
had
the
chin
of
the
shopkeeper
who
had
sold
him
the
cigars,
and
put
it
away
somewhere
to
be
brought
out
when
he
wanted
it.
The
visitors,
not
agreeably
impressed
beforehand
by
Goler

of
the
artist,
were
still
less
so
by
his
personal
appearance.

of

face,
and
the
combined
expression
of
timidity
and
anxiety
to
keep
up
his
dignity,
Mihailov,
made
an
unpleasant
impression.
"Please
step
in,"
he
said,
trying
to
look
indifferent,
and
going
into
the
passage
he
took
a
key
out
of
his
pocket
and
opened
the
door.
Chapter

On
entering
the
studio,
Mihailov,
once
more
scanned
his
visitors
and
noted
down
in
his
imagination
Vrye

and
especially
his
jaws.
Although
his
artistic
sense
was
unceasingly
at
work
collecting
materials,
although
he
felt
a
continually
increasing
excitement
as
the
moment
of
criticizing
his
work
drew
nearer,
he
rapidly
and
subtly
formed,
from
imperceptible
signs,
a
mental
image
of
these
three
persons.
That
fellow
null
was
a
Russian
living
here.
Mihailov,
did
not
remember
his
surname
nor
where
he
had
met
him,
nor
what
he
had
said
to
him.
He
only
remembered
his
face
as
he
remembered
all
the
faces
he
had
ever
seen;
but
he
remembered,
too,
that
it
was
one
of
the
faces
laid
by
in
his
memory
in
the
immense
class
of
the
falsely
consequential
and
poor
in
expression.
The
abundant
hair
and
very
open
forehead
gave
an
appearance
of
consequence
to
the
face,
which
had
only
one
expression.
petty,
childish,
peevishly
expression,
concentrated
just
above
the
bridge
of
the
narrow
nose.
Vrye
and
Madame
Karenina
must
be,
Mihailov,
supposed,
distinguished
and
wealthy
Russians,
knowing
nothing
about
art,
like
all
those
wealthy
Russians,
but
posing
as
amateurs
and
connoisseurs.
"Most
likely
they've
already
looked
at
all
the
antiques,
and
now
they're
making
the
round
of
the
studios
of
the
new
people,
the
German
humbug.
and
the
cracked
Pre-Raphaelites'
English
fellow,
and
have
only
come
to
me
to
make
the
point
of
view
complete,"
he
thought.
He
was
well
acquainted
with
the
way
diligence
have
(the
cleverer
they
were
the
worse
he
found
them)
of
looking
at
the
works
of
contemporary
artists
with
the
sole
object
of
being
in
a
position
to
say
that
art
is
a
thing
of
the
past,
and
that
the
more
one
sees
of
the
new
men
the
more
one
sees
how
inimitable
the
works
of
the
great
old
masters
have
remained.
He
expected
all
this;
he
saw
it
all
in
their
faces,
he
saw
it
in
the
careless
indifference
with
which
they
talked
among
themselves,
stared
at
the
lay
figures
and
busts,
and
walked
about
in
leisurely
fashion,
waiting
for
him
to
uncover
his
picture.
But
in
spite
of
this,
while
he
was
turning
over
his
studies,
pulling
up
the
blinds
and
taking
off
the
sheet,
he
was
in
intense
excitement,
especially
as,
in
spite
of
his
conviction
that
all
distinguished
and
wealthy
Russians
were
certain
to
be
beasts
and
fools,
he
liked
Vrye
and
still
more
Anna.
"Here,
if
you
please,"
he
said,
moving
on
one
side
with
his
nimble
gait
and
pointing
to
his
picture,
"it's
the
exhortation
to
Pilatus
Matthew,
chapter
y
he
said,
feeling
his
lips
were
beginning
to
tremble
with
emotion.
He
moved
away
and
stood
behind
them.
For
the
few
seconds
during
which
the
visitors
were
gazing
at
the
picture
in
silence
Mihailov,
too
gazed
at
it
with
the
indifferent
eye
of
an
outsider.
For
those
few
seconds
he
was
sure
in
anticipation
that
a
higher,
justice
criticism
would
be
uttered
by
them,
by
those
very
visitors
whom
he
had
been
so
despising
a
moment
before.
He
forgot
all
he
had
thought
about
his
picture
before
during
the
three
years
he
had
been
painting
it;
he
forgot
all
its
qualities
which
had
been
absolutely
certain
to
him-her
saw
the
picture
with
their
indifferent,
new,
outside
eyes,
and
saw
nothing
good
in
it.
He
saw
in
the
foreground
Pilate's
irritated
face
and
the
serene
face
of
Christ,
and
in
the
background
the
figures
of
Pilate's
retinue
and
the
face
of
John
watching
what
was
happening.
Every
face
that,
with
such
agony,
such
blunders
and
corrections
had
grown
up
within
him
with
its
special
character,
every
face
that
had
given
him
such
torments
and
such
rapturous
and
all
these
faces
so
many
times
transposed
for
the
sake
of
the
harmony
of
the
whole,
all
the
shades
of
color
and
tones
that
he
had
attained
with
such
labor-HHS
of
this
together
seemed
to
him
now,
looking
at
it
with
their
eyes,
the
merest
vulgarity,
something
that
had
been
done
a
thousand
times
over.
The
face
dearest
to
him,
the
face
of
Christ,
the
center
of
the
picture,
which
had
given
him
such
ecstasy
as
it
unfolded
itself
to
him,
was
utterly
lost
to
him
when
he
glanced
at
the
picture

their
eyes.

however,
that
Mihailov,
was
expecting
a
criticism
of
the
picture,
he
said:
"Your
picture
has
got
on
a
great
deal
since
I
saw
it
last
time;
and
what
strikes
me
particularly
now,
as
it
did
then,
is
the
figure
of
Pilatus
One

the
man:
a
good-natured,
capital
fellow,
but
an
official

who
does
not

it
is

doing.
But

He
tried
to

something,

he
could
not

pretended
to
be
coughing.

trifling
as
was
the
true
remark
upon
the
fidelity
of
the
expression
of
Pilate's
as
an
official,
and
offensive
as
might
have
seemed
the
utterance
of
so
unimportant
an
observation
while
nothing
was
said
of
more
serious
points,
Mihailov,
was
in
an
ecstasy
of
delight
at
this
observation.
He
had
himself
thought
about
Pilate's
figure
just
what
Goler
said.
The
fact
that
this
reflection
was
but
one
of
millions
of
reflections,
which
as
Mihailov,
knew
for
certain
would
be
true,
did
not
diminish
for
him
the
significance
of

His
heart
warmed
to
Goler
for
this
remark,
and
from
a
state
of
depression
he
suddenly
passed
to
ecstasy.
At
once
the
whole
of
his
picture
lived
before
him
in
all
the
indescribable
complexity
of
everything

Mihailov,
again
tried
to
say
that

quivered

and
he
could

Mihailov,
fancied
that

went
up
to
them.

said
Anna.
Of
all
she
saw
she
liked
that
expression
most
of
all,
and
she
felt
that
it
was
the

and
so
praise
of

would
be

to
the

"One

This
again
was
one
of
the

that
could
be

in

in
the

of
Christ.
She

In
Christ's
expression
there
ought
to
be
indeed
an
expression

there
is
an
expression
of

of
heavenly
peace,
of
readiness
for

and
a
sense
of
the
vanity
of

Of
course
there
is
the
expression
of
an
official
in
Pilate's
and
of
pity
in
Christ,
seeing
that
one
is
the
incarnation

and

and
looking
angrily
at
Vrye
he
suddenly
scowled.
He
had
often
heard
this
word
technique,
and
was
utterly
unable
to
understand
what
was
understood
by
it.
He
knew
that
by
this
term
was
understood
a
mechanical
facility
for
painting
or
drawing,
entirely
apart
from
its
subject.
He
had
noticed
often
that
even
in
actual
praise
technique
was
opposed
to
essential
quality,
as
though
one
could
paint
well
something
that
was
bad.
He
knew
that
a
great
deal
of
attention
and
care
was
necessary
in
taking
off
the
coverings,
to
avoid
injuring
the
creation
itself,
and
to
take
off
all
the

but
there
was
no

If

were
revealed

or
she
would
have
been
able
to
peel
the
wrappings
off
what
was
seen.
And
the
most
experienced
and
adroit
painter
could
not
by
mere
mechanical
facility
paint
anything
if
the
lines
of
the
subject
were
not
revealed
to
him
first.
Besides,
he
saw
that
if
it
came
to
talking
about
technique,
it
was
impossible
to
praise
him
for
it.
In
all
he
had
painted
and
repainted

saw

that
hurt
his
eyes,
coming
from
want
of

he
could
not
correct
now
without
spoiling
the
whole.
And
in
almost
all
the
figures
and
faces
he
saw,
too,
remnants
of
the
wrappings
not
perfectly
removed
that
spoiled
the
picture.
"One
thing
might
be
said,
if
you
will
allow
me
to
make
the
remark:
observed
Goler
"Oh,
I
shall
be
delighted,
I
beg
you,"
said
Mihailov,
with
a
forced
smile.
"That
is,
that
you
make
Him
the
man-hater,
and
not
the
God.
But
I
know
that
was
what
you
meant
to
do."
"I
cannot
paint
a
Christ
that
is
not
in
my
heart,"
said
Mihailov,
gloomy
null
but
in
that
case,
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
what
I
think15
Your
picture
is
so
fine
that
my
observation
cannot
detract
from
it,
and,
besides,
it
is
only
my
personal
opinion.
With
you
it
is
different.
Your
very
motive
is
different.
But
let
us
take
Ivanov.
I
imagine
that
if
Christ
is
brought
down
to
the
level
of
an
historical
character,
it
would
have
been
better
for
Ivanov
to
select
some
other
historical
subject,
fresh,
untouched:
"But
if
this
is
the
greatest
subject
presented
to
art?"
"If
one
looked
one
would
find
others.
But
the
point
is
that
art
cannot
suffer
doubt
and
discussion.
And
before
the
picture
of
Ivanov
the
question
arises
for
the
believer
and
the
unbeliever,
alike,
'Is
it
God,
or
is
it
not
Godard.'
and
the
unity
of
the
impression
is
destroyed."
"Why
so?
I
think
that
for
educated
people,"
said
Mihailov,
"the
question
cannot
exist."
Goler
did
not
agree
with
this,
and
confounded
Mihailov,
by
his
support
of
his
first
idea
of
the
unity
of
the
impression
being
essential
to
art.
Mihailov,
was
greatly
perturbed,
but
he
could
say
nothing
in
defense
of
his
own
idea.

Mihajlovic,
He
had

he

painted
three
years
ago.
He
had
forgotten
all
the
agonies
and
the
ecstasy
he
had
lived
through
with
that
picture
when
for
several
months
it
had
been
the
one
thought

him

and
night.
He
had
forgotten,
as
he
always
forgot,
the
pictures
he
had
finished.
He
did
not
even
like
to
look
at
it,
and
had
only
brought
it
out
because
he
was
expecting
an
Englishman
who
wanted
to
buy
it.
"Oh,
that's
only
an
old
study,"
he
said.
"How
fine"
said
Goler
he
too,
with
unmistakable
sincerity,
falling
under
the
spell
of
the
picture.

What
was
he
thinking

The
enthusiasm
over
this
picture
stirred
some
of
the
old
feeling
for
it
in
Mihailov,
but
he
feared
and
disliked
this
waste
of
feeling
for
things
past,
and
so,
even
though
this
praise
was
grateful
to
him,
he
tried
to
draw
his
visitors
away
to
a
third
picture.
But
Vrye
asked
whether
the
picture
was
for

To
Mihailov,
at
that
moment,
excited
by
visitors,
it
was
extremely
distasteful
to
speak
of
money
matters.
"It
is
put
up
there
to
be
sold,"
he
answered,
scowling
gloomy
When
the
visitors
had
gone,
Mihailov,
sat
down
opposite
the
picture
of
Pilate's
and
Christ,
and
in
his
mind
went
over
what
had
been
said,
and
what,
though
not
said,
had
been
implied
by
those
visitors.
And,
strange
to
say,
what
had
had
such
weight
with
him,
while
they
were
there
and
while
he
mentally
put
himself
at
their
point
of
view,
suddenly
lost
all
importance
for
him.
He
began
to
look
at
his
picture
with
all
his
own
full
artist
vision,
and
was
soon
in
that
mood
of
conviction
of
the
perfecting
and
so
of
the
significance,
of
his
picture-filled
conviction
essential
to
the
most
intense
fervor,
excluding
all
other
interests.
which
alone
he
could
work.
Christ's
foreshortened
leg
was
not
right,
though.
He
took
his
palette
and
began
to
work.
As
he
corrected
the
leg
he
looked
continually
at
the
figure
of
John
in
the
background,
which
his
visitors
had
not
even
noticed,
but
which
he
knew
was
beyond
perfection.
When
he
had
finished
the
leg
he
wanted
to
touch
that
figure,
but
he
felt
too
much
excited
for
it.
He
was
equally
unable
to
work
when
he
was
cold
and
when
he
was
too
much
affected
and
saw
everything
too
much.
There
was
only
one
stage
in
the
transition
from
coldness
to
inspiration,
at
which
work
was
possible.
Today
he
was
too
much
agitated.
He
would
have
covered
the
picture,
but
he
stopped,
holding
the
cloth
in
his
hand,
and,
smiling
blister
gazed
a
long
while
at
the
figure
of
John.
At
last,
as
it
were
regretfully
tearing
himself
away,
he
dropped
the
cloth,
and,
exhausted
but
happy,
went
home.
Vrye
Anna,
and
Goler
on
their

home,
were

lively
and
cheerful.
They
talked

the

from

recurred
particularly
often
in
their
talk,
as
though
it
were
necessary
for
them
to
sum
up
what
they
had
no
conception
of,
though
they
wanted
to
talk
of

that

the

coming
back
to
it.

Mihailov,
sold
Vrye
his
picture,
and
agreed
to
paint
a
portrait
of
Anna.
On
the
day
fixed
he
came
and
began
the
work.
From
the
fifth
sitting
the
portrait
impressed
everyone,
especially
Vrye
not

by
its
resemblance.
but
by
its
characteristic
beauty.
It
was
strange
how
Mihailov,
could
have
discovered
just
her
characteristic
beauty.
"One
needs
to
know
and
love
her
as
I
have
loved
her
to
discover
the
very
sweetest
expression
of
her
soul,"
Vrye
thought,
though
it
was
only
from
this
portrait
that
he
had
himself
learned
this
sweetest
expression
of
her
soul.
But
the
expression
was
so
true
that
he,
and
others
too,
fancied
they
had
long
known
it.
"I
have
been
struggling
on
for
ever
so
long
without
doing
anything,"
he
said
of
his
own
portrait
of
her,
"and
he
just
looked
and
painted
it.
That's
where
technique
comes
in."
"That
will
come,"
was
the
consoling
reassurance
given
him
by
Goler
in
whose

had

important,

felt
that

in

Mihailov,

quite
a

from

behaved

were

envious.
Anna's
portrait-type
same
subject
painted
from
nature
both
by
him
and
by
Mihajlovic,
to
have
shown
Vrye
the
difference
between
him
and
Mihajlovic,
but
he
did
not
see
it.
Only
after
Mihailov,
portrait
was
painted
he
left
off
painting
his
portrait
of
Anna,
deciding
that
it
was
now
not
needed.
His
picture
of
mediaeval
life
he
went
on
with.
And
he
himself,
and
Goler
and
still
more
Anna,
thought
it
very
good,
because
it
was
far
more
like
the
celebrated
pictures
they
knew
than
Mihailov,
picture.
Mihailov,
meanwhile,
although
Anna's
portrait
greatly
fascinated
him,
was
even
more
glad
than
they
were
when
the
sittings
were
over,
and
he
had
no
longer
to
listen
to
Goler
disquisitions
upon
art,
and
could
forget
about
Vrye
painting.
He
knew
that
Vrye
could
not
be
prevented
from
amusing
himself
with
paintings
he
knew
that
he
and
all
diligence
had
a
perfect
right
to
paint
what
they
liked,
but
it
was
distasteful
to
him.
A
man
could
not
be
prevented
from
making
himself
a
big
wax
doll,
and
kissing
it.
But
if
the
man
were
to
come
with
the
doll
and
sit
before
a
man
in
love,
and
begin
caressing
his
doll
as
the
lover
caressed
the
woman
he
loved,
it
would
be
distasteful
to
the
lover.
Just
such
a
distasteful
sensation
was
what
Mihailov,
felt
at
the
sight
of
Vrye
paintings
he
felt
it
both
ludicrous
and
irritating,
both
pitiable
and
offensive.
Vrye
interest
in
painting
and
the
Middle
Ages
did
not
last
long.
He
had
enough
taste
for
painting
to
be
unable
to
finish
his
picture.
The
picture
came
to
a
standstill.
He
was
vaguely
aware
that
its
defects,
inconspicuous
at
first,
would
be
glaring
if
he
were
to
go
on
with
it.
The
same
experience
befell
him
as
Goler
who
felt
that
he
had
nothing
to
say,
and
continually
deceived
himself
with
the
theory
that
his
idea
was
not
yet
mature,
that
he
was
working
it
out
and
collecting
materials.
This
exasperated
and
tortured
Goler
but
Vrye
was
incapable
of
deceiving
and
torturing
himself,
and
even
more
incapable
of
exasperation.
With
his
characteristic
decision,
without
explanation
or
apology,
he
simply
ceased
working
at
painting.
But
without
this
occupation,
the
life
of
Vrye
and
of
Anna,
who
wondered
at
his
loss
of
interest
in
it,
struck
them
as
intolerably
tedious
in
an
Italian
town.
The
palazzo
suddenly
seemed
so
obtuse
old
and
dirty,
the
spots
on
the
curtains,
the
cracks
in
the
floors,
the
broken
plaster
on
the
cornices,
became
so
disagreed
obvious,
and
the
everlasting
sameness
of
Goler
and
the
Italian
professor
and
the
German
traveler
became
so
wearisomely
that
they
had
to
make
some
change.
They
resolved
to
go
to
Russia,
to
the
country.
In
Petersburg
Vrye
intended
to
arrange
a
partition
of
the
land
with
his
brother,
while
Anna
meant
to
see
her
son.
The
summer
they
intended
to
spend
on
Vrye
great
family
estate.
Chapter
14
Levin
had
been
married
three
months.
He
was
happy,
but
not
at
all
in
the
way
he
had
expected
to
be.
At
every
step
he
found
his
former
dreams
disappointed,
and
new,
unexpected
surprises
of
happiness.
He
was
happy;
but
on
entering
upon
family
life
he
saw
at
every
step
that
it
was
utterly
different
from
what
he
had
imagined.
At
every
step
he
experienced
what
a
man
would
experience
who,
after
admiring
the
smooth,
happy
course
of
a
little
boat
on
a
lake,
should
get
himself
into
that
little
boat.
He
saw
that
it
was
not
all
sitting
still,
floating
smoothly;
that
one
had
to
think
too,
not
for
an
instant
to
forget
where
one
was
floatplane,
and
that
there
was
water
under
one,
and
that
one
must
row;
and
that
his
unaccustomed
hands
would
be
sorely
and
that
it
was
only
to
look
at
it
that
was
easy;
but
that
doing
it,
though
very
delightful,
was
very
difficult.
As
a
bachelor,
when
he
had
watched
other
people's
married
life,
seen
the
petty
cares,
the
squabbles,
the
jealousy,
he
had
only
smiled
contemptuously
in
his
heart.
In
his
future
married
life
there
could
be,
he
was
convinced,
nothing
of
that
sort;
even
the
external
forms,
indeed,
he
fancier
must
be
utterly
unlike
the
life
of
others
in
everything.
And
all
of
a
sudden,
instead
of
his
life
with
his
wife
being
made
on
an
individual
pattern,
it
was,
on
the
contrary,
entirely
made
up
of
the
pettifogging
details,
which
he
had
so
despised
before,
but
which
now,
by
no
will
of
his
own,
had
gained
an
extraordinary
importance
that
it
was
useless
to
contend
against.
And
Levin
saw
that
the
organization
of
all
these
details
was
by
no
means
so
easy
as
he
had
fancied
before.
Although
Levin
believed
himself
to
have
the
most
exact
conceptions
of
domestic
life,
unconsciously,
like
all
men,
he
pictured
domestic
life
as
the
happiest
enjoyment
of
love,
with
nothing
to
hinder
and
no
petty
cares
to
distracted
He
ought,
as
he
conceived
the
position,
to
do
his
work,
and
to
find
repose
from
it
in
the
happiness
of
love.
She
ought
to
be
beloved,
and
nothing
more.
But,
like
all
men,
he
forgot
that
she
too
would
want
work.
And
he
was
surprised
that
she,
his
poetic,
exquisite
Kitty,
could,
not
merely
in
the
first
weeks,
but
even
in
the
first
days
of
their
married
life,
think,
remember,
and
busy
herself
about
tablecloths,
and
furniture,
about
mattresses
for
visitors,
about
a
tray,
about
the
cook,
and
the
dinner,
and
so
on.
While
they
were
still
engaged,
he
had
been
struck
by
the
definiteness
with
which
she
had
declined
the
tour
abroad
and
decided
to
go
into
the
country,
as
though
she
knew
of
something
she
wanted,
and
could
still
think
of
something
outside
her
love.
This
had
jarred
upon
him
then,
and
now
her
trivial
cares
and
anxieties
jarred
upon
him
several
times.
But
he
saw
that
this
was
essential
for
her.
And,
loving
her
as
he
did,
though
he
did
not
understand
the
reason
of
them,
and
jeered
at
these
domestic
pursuits,
he
could
not
help
admiring
them.
He
jeered
at
the
way
in
which
she
arranged
the
furniture
they
had
brought
from
Moscow;
rearranged
their
room;
hung

of
the
old
cookbook
came
into
collision
with
Agag
Mihalowski
taking
from
her
the
charge
of
the
stores.
He
saw
how
the
old
cook
smiled,
admiring
her,
and
listening
to
her
inexperienced,
impossible
orders,
how
mournfully
and
tenderly
Agag
Mihalowski
shook
her
head
over
the
young
mistress,
new

He
saw
that
Kitty
was
extraordinarily
sweet
when,
laughing
and
crying,
she
came
to
tell
him
that
her
maid,
Masha.
was
used
to
looking
upon
her
as
her
young
lady,
and
so
no
one
obeyed
her.
It
seemed
to
him
sweet,
but
strange,
and
he
thought
it
would
have
been
better
without
this.
He
did
not
know
how
great
a
sense
of
change
she
was
experientially
she,
who
at
home
had
sometimes
wanted
some
favorite
dish,
or
sweets,
without
the
possibility
of
getting
either,
now
could
order
what
she
liked,
buy
pounds
of
sweets,
spend
as
much
money
as
she
liked,
and
order
any
puddings
she
pleased.
She
was
dreaming
with
delight
now
of
Dolly,
coming
to
them
with
her
children,
especially
because
she
would
order
for
the
children
their
favorite
puddings
and
Dolly
would
appreciate
all
her
new
housekeeping.
She
did
not
know
herself
why
and
wherever
but
the
arranging
of
her
house
had
an
irresistible
attraction
for
her.
Instinctively
feeling
the
approach
of
spring,
and
knowing
that
there
would
be
days
of
rough
weather
too,
she
built
her
nest
as
best
she
could,
and
was
in
haste
at
the
same
time
to
build
it
and
to
learn
how
to
do
it.
This
care
for
domestic
details
in
Kitty,
so
opposed
to
Levin's
ideal
of
exalted
happiness,
was
at
first
one
of
the
disappoints
and
this
sweet
care
of
her
household,
the
aim
of
which
he
did
not
understand,
but
could
not
help
loving,
was
one
of
the
new
happy
surprises.
Another
disappointment
and
happy
surprise
came
in
their
quarrels.
Levin
could
never
have
conceived
that
between
him
and
his
wife
any
relations
could
arise
other
than
tender,
respectful
and
loving,
and
all
at
once
in
the
very
early
days
they
quarreled.
so
that
she
said
he
did
not
care
for
her,
that
he
cared
for
no
one
but
himself,
burst
into
tears,
and
wrung
her
arms.
This
first
quarrel
arose
from
Levin's
having
gone
out
to
a
new
farmhouse
and
having
been
away
half
an
hour
too
long,
because
he
had
tried
to
get
home
by
a
short
cut
and
had
lost
his
way.
He
drove
home
thinking
of
nothing
but
her,
of
her
love,
of
his
own
happiness,
and
the
nearer
he
drew
to
home,
the
warmer
was
his
tenderness
for
her.
He
ran
into
the
room
with
the
same
feeling,
with
an
even
stronger
feeling
than
he
had
had
when
he
reached
the
Shtern
house
to
make
his
offer.
And
suddenly
he
was
met
by
a
lowering
expression
he
had
never
seen
in
her.
He
would
have
kissed
her;
she
pushed
him
away.
"What
is
it?"
"You've
been
enjoying
yourself,"
she
began,
trying
to
be
calm
and
spitfire
But
as
soon
as
she
opened
her
mouth,
a
stream
of
reproach,
of
senseless
jealousy,
of
all
that
had
been
torturing
her
during
that
half
hour
which
she
had
spent
sitting
motionless
at
the
window,
burst
from
her.
It
was
only
then,
for
the
first
time,
that
he
clearly
understood
what
he
had
not
understood
when
he
led
her
out
of
the
church
after
the
wedding.
He
felt
now
that
he
was
not
simply
close
to
her,
but
that
he
did
not
know
where
he
ended
and
she
began.
He
felt
this
from
the
agonizing
sensation
of
division
that
he
experienced
at
that
instant.
He
was
offended
for
the
first
instant,
but
the
very
same
second
he
felt
that
he
could
not
be
offended
by
her,
that
she
was
himself.
He
felt
for
the
first
moment
as
a
man
feels
when,
having
suddenly
received
a
violent
blow
from
behind,
he
turns
round,
angry
and
eager
to
avenge
himself,
to
look
for
his
antagonist,
and
finds
that
it
is
he
himself
who
has
accidentally
struck
himself,
that
there
is
no
one
to
be
angry
with,
and
that
he
must
put
up
with
and
try
to
soothe
the
pain.
Never
afterwards
did
he
feel
it
with
such
intensity,
but
this
first
time
he
could
not
for
a
long
while
get
over
it.
His
natural
feeling
urged
him
to
defend
himself,
to
prove
to
her
she
was
wrong;
but
to
prove
her
wrong
would
mean
irritating
her
still
more
and
making
the
rupture
greater
that
was
the
cause
of
all
his
suffering.
One
habitual
feeling
impelled
him
to
get
rid
of
the
blame
and
to
pass
it
on
to
her.
Another
feeling,
even
stronger,
impelled
him
as
quickly
as
possible
to
smooth
over
the
rupture
without
letting
it
grow
greater.
To
remain
under
such
undeserved
reproach
was
wretched,
but
to
make
her
suffer
by
justifying
himself
was
worse
still.
Like
a
man
half-aware
in
an
agony
of
pain,
he
wanted
to
tear
out,
to
fling
away
the
aching
place,
and
coming
to
his
senses,
he
felt
that
the
aching
place
was
himself.
He
could
do
nothing
but
try
to
help
the
aching
place
to
bear
it,
and
this
he
tried
to
do.
They
made
peace.
She,
recognizing
that
she
was
wrong,
though
she
did
not
say
so,
became
tenderfooted
to
him,
and
they
experienced
new,
redoubled
happiness
in
their
love.
But
that
did
not
prevent
such
quarrels
from
happening
again,
and
exceedingly
often
too,
on
the
most
unexpected
and
trivial
grounds.
These
quarrels
frequently
arose
from
the
fact
that
they
did
not
yet
know
what
was
of
importance
to
each
other
and
that
all
this
early
period
they
were
both
often
in
a
bad
temper.
When
one
was
in
a
good
temper,
and
the
other
in
a
bad
temper,
the
peace
was
not
broker
but
when
both
happened
to
be
in
an
ill-informed,
quarrels
sprang
up
from
such
incomprehension
trifling
causes,
that
they
could
never
remember
afterwards
what
they
had
quarreled
about.
It
is
true
that
when
they
were
both
in
a
good
temper
their
enjoyment
of
life
was
redoubles
But
still
this
first
period
of
their
married
life
was
a
difficult
time
for
them.
During
all
this
early
time
they
had
a
peculiarly
vivid
sense
of
tension,
as
it
were,
a
tugging
in
opposite
directions
of
the
chain
by
which
they
were
bound.
Altogether
their
honeymoon.
is
to
say,
the
month
after
their
wedding-busting
which
from
tradition
Levin
expected
so
much,
was
not
merely
not
a
time
of
sweetness,
but
remained
in
the
memories
of
both
as
the
bitterest
and
most
humiliating
period
in
their
lives.
They
both
alike
tried
in
later
life
to
blot
out
from
their
memories
all
the
monstrous,
shameful
incidents
of
that
morbid
period,
when
both
were
rarely
in
a
normal
frame
of
mind,
both
were
rarely
quite
themselves.
It
was
only
in
the
third
month
of
their
married
life,
after
their
return
from
Moscow,
where
they
had
been
staying
for
a
month,
that
their
life
began
to
go
more
smoothly.
Chapter
15
They
had
just
come
back
from
Moscow,
and
were
glad
to
be
alone.
He
was
sitting
at
the
writing
table
in
his
study,
writing.
She,
wearing
the
dark
lilac
dress
she
had
worn
during
the
first
days
of
their
married
life,
and
put
on
again
today,
a
dress
particularly
remembered
and
loved
by
him,
was
sitting
on
the
sofa,
the
same
old-fashioned
leather
sofa
which
had
always
stood
in
the
study
in
Levin's
father's
and
grandfather's
days.
She
was
sewing
at
_but
angle
He
thought
and
wrote,
never
losing
the
happy
consciousness
of
her
presence.
His
work,
both
on
the
land
and
on
the
book,
in
which
the
principles
of
the
new
land
system
were
to
be
laid
down,
had
not
been
abandoning
but
just
as
formerly
these
pursuits
and
ideas
had
seemed
to
him
petty
and
trivial
in
comparison
with
the
darkness
that
overstaffed
all
life,
now
they
seemed
as
unimportant
and
petty
in
comparison
with
the
life
that
lay
before
him
suffused
with
the
brilliant
light
of
happiness.
He
went
on
with
his
work,
but
he
felt
now
that
the
center
of
gravity
of
his
attention
had
passed
to
something
else,
and
that
consequently
he
looked
at
his
work
quite
differently
and
more
clearly.
Formerly
this
work
had
been
for
him
an
escape
from
life.
Formerly
he
had
felt
that
without
this
work
his
life
would
be
too
gloomy.
Now
these
pursuits
were
necessary
for
him
that
life
might
not
be
too
uniformly
bright.
Taking
up
his
manuscript,
reading
through
what
he
had
written,
he
found
with
pleasure
that
the
work
was
worth
his
working
at.
Many
of
his
old
ideas
seemed
to
him
superfluous
and
extreme,
but
many
blanks
became
distinct
to
him
when
he
reviewed
the
whole
thing
in
his
memory.
He
was
writing
now
a
new
chapter
on
the
causes
of
the
present
disastrous
condition
of
agriculture
in
Russia.
He
maintained
that
the
poverty
of
Russia
arises
not
merely
from
the
anomalous
distribution
of
landed
property
and
misdirected
reforms,
but
that
what
had
contributed
of
late
years
to
this
result
was
the
civilization

with
great

flirted
with

a

I'll
never

"And

"IBM

up

She
took
up

and
began
cutting

out.
"Nobel

he
said,
sitting
down
beside

and
watching
the
tiny
scissors
moving
round.
"Oh!
what
was

about?
I
was
thinking
about

about

"Why

he
said,
kissing

"I

"And

he
said,
carefully

"A

and
they
darted
apart
from

another
like
culprits
when
Kouzmine
came
in
to
announce
that

Levin
asked
Kouzmine
"They've
just
come;
they're

"Come

she
said
to
him
as
she
went
out
of
the
study,
"or
else
I
shall
read

Left
alone,
after
putting

manuscripts
together
in

bought
by

he
washed
his
hands
at
the
new
washtubs.
with
the
elegant
fittings,
that
had
all
made
their
appearance
with
her.
Levin
smiled
at
his
own
thoughts,
and
shook
his
head
disapprovingly.
at
those
thoughts?
a
feeling
akin
to
remorse
fretted
him.
There
was
something
shameful,
effervescence
Capucci
as
he
called
it
to
himself,
in
his
present
mode
of
life.
"It's
not
right
to
go
on
like
this,"
he
thought.
"It'll
soon
be
three
months,
and
I'm
doing
next
to
nothing.
Today,
almost
for
the
first
time,
I
set
to
work
seriously,
and
what
happened?
I
did
nothing
but
begin
and
throw
it
aside.
Even
my
ordinary
pursuits
I
have
almost
given
up.
On
the
land
I
scarcely
walk
or
drive
about
at
all
to
look
after
things.
Either
I
am
loath
to
leave
her,
or
I
see
she's
dull
alone.
And
I
used
to
think
that,
before
marriage,
life
was
nothing
much,
somehow
didn't
count,
but
that
after
marriage,
life
began
in
earnest.
And
here
almost
three
months
have
passed,
and
I
have
spent
my
time
so
idly
and
unprogrammed
No,
this
won't
do;
I
must
begin.
Of
course,
it's
not
her
fault.
She's
not
to
blame
in
any
way.
I
ought
myself
to
be
firmer,
to
maintain
my
masculine
independence
of
action;
or
else
I
shall
get
into
such
ways,
and
she'll
get
used
to
them
too:
Of
course
she's
not
to
blame,"
he
told
himself.
But
it
is
hard
for
anyone
who
is
dissatisfied
not
to
blame
someone
else,
and
especially
the
person
nearest
of
all
to
him,
for
the
ground
of
his
dissatisfaction.
And
it
vaguely
came
into
Levin's
mind
that
she
herself
was
not
to
blame
(she
could
not
be
to
blame
for
anything),
but
what
was
to
blame
was
her
education,
too
superficial
and
frivolous.
("That's
fool
Tchegodar
she
wanted,
I
know,
to
stop
him,
but
didn't
know
how
to.".
"Yes,
apart
from
her
interest
in
the
house
(that
she
has,
apart
from
dress
and
_but
angle
she
has
no
serious
interests.
No
interest
in
her
work,
in
the
estate,
in
the
peasants,
nor
in
music,
though
she's
rather
good
at
it,
nor
in
reading.
She
does
nothing,
and
is
perfectly
satisfied."
Levin,
in
his
heart,
censured
this,
and
did
not
as
yet
understand
that
she
was
preparing
for
that
period
of
activity
which
was
to
come
for
her
when
she
would
at
once
be
the
wife
of
her
husband
and
mistress
of
the
house,
and
would
bear,
and
nurse,
and
bring
up
children.
He
knew
not
that
she
was
instinctively
aware
of
this,
and
preparing
herself
for
this
time
of
terrible
toil,
did
not
reproach
herself
for
the
moments
of
carelessness
and
happiness
in
her
love
that
she
enjoyed
now
while
gaily
building
her
nest
for
the
future.

16
When
Levin
went
upstairs,
his
wife
was
sitting
near
the
new
silver
samovar,
behind
the
new
tea
service,
and,
having
settled
old
Agag
Mihalowski
at
a
little
table
with
a
full
cup
of
tea,
was
reading
a
letter
from
Dolly,
with
whom
they
were
in
continual
and
frequent
correspondence.
"You
see,
your
good
lady's
settled
me
here,
told
me
to
sit
a
bit
with
her,"
said
Agag
Mihalowski
smiling
affectionately
at
Kitty.
In
these
words
of
Agag
Mihalowski
Levin
read
the
final
act
of
the
drama
which
had
been
enacted
of
late
between
her
and
Kitty.
He
saw
that,
in

feelings
being
hurt
by
a
new
mistress
taking
the
reins
of

out
of
her
hands,
Kitty
had
yet
conquered
her
and
made
her
love
her.
"Here,
I
opened
your
letter
too,"
said
Kitty,
handing
him
an
illiterate
letter.
"It's
from
that
woman,
I
think,
your
brother)
she
said.
"I
did
not
read
it
through.
This
is
from
my
people
and
from

he
took
the
letter
from
Maryam
Nikolai
his
brother's
former
mistress,
and
began
to
read
it.
This
was
the
second
letter
he
had
received
from
Maryam
Nikolai
In
the
first
letter,
Maryam
Nikolai
wrote
that
his
brother
had
sent
her
away
for
no
fault
of
hers,
and,
with
touching
simplicity,
added
that
though
she
was
in
want
again,
she
asked
for
nothing,
and
wished
for
nothing,
but
was
only
tormented
by
the
thought
that
Nikolay
Dmitrin
would
come
to
grief
without
her,
owing
to
the
weak
state
of
his
health,
and
begged
his
brother
to
look
after
him.
Now
she
wrote
quite
differently.
She
had
found
Nikolay
Dmitrin
had
again
made
it
up
with
him
in
Moscow,
and
had
moved
with
him
to
a
provincial
town,
where
he
had
received
a
post
in
the
government
service.
But
that
he
had
quarreled
with
the
head
official,
and
was
on
his
way
back
to
Moscow,
only
he
had
been
taken
so
ill
on
the
road
that
it
was
doubtful
if
he
would
ever
leave
his
bed
again,
she
wrote.
"It's
always
of
you
he
has
talked,
and,
besides,
he
has
no
more
money
left."
"Read
this;
Dolly
writes
about
you,"
Kitty
was
beginning,
with
a
smile?
but
she
stopped
suddenly,
noticing
the
changed
expression
on
her
husband's
face.
"What
is
it?
What's
the
matter?"
"She
writes
to
me
that
Nikolay,
my
brother,
is
at
death's
door.
I
shall
go
to
him."
Kitty,

changed
at
once.
Thoughts
of
Tanya
as
a

all
had
vanished.
"When
are

she
said.
"Tongan
"And
I
will
go
with

she
said.

"I'm
going
because
my
brother
is
dying,"
said
Levin.
"Why
should
you:
"Why?
For
the
same
reason
as
you."
"And,
at
a
moment
of
such
gravity
for
me,
she
only
thinks
of
her
being
dull
by
herself,"
thought
Levin.
And
this
lack
of
candor
in
a
matter
of
such
gravity
infuriated
him.
"It's
out
of
the
question,"
he
said
sternly.
Agag
Mihalowski
seeing
that
it
was
coming
to
a
quarrel,
gently
put
down
her
cup
and
withdrew.
Kitty
did
not
even
notice
her.
The
tone
in
which
her
husband
had
said
the
last
words
wounded
her,
especially
because
he
evidently
did
not
believe
what
she
had
said.
"I
tell
you,
that
if
you
go,
I
shall
come
with
you;
I
shall
certainly
come,"
she
said
hastily
and

"Why

Why

you
say

"Because

where,
by
all
sorts
of
roads
and
to
all

of
hotels.
You
would
be
a
hindrance
to
me,"
said
Levin,
trying
to
be
cool.
"Not
at
all.
I
don't
want
anything.
Where
you
can
go,
I
can:
"Well,
for
one
thing
then,
because
this
woman's

whom
you
can't
meet."
"I
don't
know
and
don't
care
to
know
who's
there
and
what.
I
know
that
my
husband's
brother
is
dying
and
my
husband
is
going
to
him,
and
I
go
with
my
husband
too:
"Kitty"
Don't
get
angry.
But
just
think
a
little;
this
is
a
matter
of
such
importance
that
I
can't
bear
to
think
that
you
should
bring
in
a
feeling
of
weakness,
of
dislike
to
being
left
alone.
Come,
you'll
be
dull
alone,
so
go
and
stay
at
Moscow
a
little."
"There,
you
always
ascribe
base,
vile
motives
to
me,"
she
said
with
tears
of
wounded
pride
and
fury.
"I
didn't
mean,
it
wasn't
weakness,
it
wasn't
...
I
feel
that
it's
my
duty
to
be
with
my
husband
when
he's
in
trouble,
but
you
try

to
hurt
me,
you
try
on

to

"Nobel
this
is
awful!
To
be
such
a
slave,
cried
Levin,
getting
up,
and
unable
to
restrain
his
anger
any
longer.
But
at
the
same
second
he
felt
that
he
was
beating
himself.
"Then

You

she
said,
getting
up
and
running
away
into
the
drawing
room.
When
he
went
to
her,
she
was
sobbing;
He
began
to
speak,
trying
to
find
words
not
to
dissuade
but
simply
to
soothe
her.
But
she
did
not
heed
him,
and
would
not
agree
to
anything.
He
bent
down
to
her
and
took
her
hand,
which
resisted
him.
He
kissed
her
hand,
kissed
her
hair,
kissed
her
hand
again.
she
was
silent.
But
when
he
took
her
face
in
both
his
hands
and
said
"Kitty"
she
suddenly
recovered
herself,
and
began
to
cry,
and
they
were
reconciled.
It
was
decided
that
they
should
go
together
the
next
day.
Levin
told
his
wife
that
he
believed
she
wanted
to
go
simply
in
order
to
be
of
use,
agreed
that
Maryam

not

but
he

with

He
was
dissatisfied
with

he
was
dissatisfied

Even

The
hotel
of
the
provincial

where
Nikolay

young
life,
especially
because
the
impression
of
falsity
made
by
the
hotel
was
so
out
of
keeping
with
what
awaited
them.
As
is
invariably
the
case,
after
they
had
been
asked
at
what
price
they
wanted
rooms,
it
appeared
that
there
was
not
one
decent
room
for
them;
one
decent
room
had
been
taken
by
the
inspector
of
railroads,
another
by
a
lawyer
from
Moscow,
a
third
by
Princess
Astagir
from
the
country.
There
remained
only
one
filthy
room,
next
to
which
they
promised
that
another
should
be
empty
by
the
evening.
Feeling
angry
with
his
wife
because
what
he
had
expected
had
come
to
pass,
which
was
that
at
the
moment
of
arrival,
when
his
heart
throbbed
with
emotion
and
anxiety
to
know
how
his
brother
was
getting
on,
he
should
have
to
be
seeing
after
her,
instead
of
rushing
straight
to
his
brother,
Levin
conducted
her
to
the
room
assigned
them.
"Go,
do
go!"
she
said,
looking
at
him
with
timid
and
guilty
eyes.
He
went
out
of
the
door
without
a
word,
and
at
once
stumbled
over
Maryam
Nikolai
who
had
heard
of
his
arrival
and
had
not
dared
to
go
in
to
see
him.
She
was
just
the
same
as
when
he
saw
her
in
Moscow;
the
same
woolen
gown,
and
bare
arms
and
neck,
and
the
same
good-naturedly
stupid,
pockmarked
face,
only
a
little
plumpest
"Well,
how
is
he?
how
is
he?"
"Very
bad.
He
can't
get
up.
He
has
kept
expecting
you.
HeMan's
Are
you
...
with
your
wife?"
Levin
did
not
for
the
first
moment
understand
what
it
was
confused
her,
but
she
immediately
enlightened
him.
"I'll
go
away.
I'll
go
down
to
the
kitchen,"
she
brought
out.
"Nil
Dmitrin
will
be
delighted.
He
heard
about
it,
and
knows
your
lady,
and
remembers
her
abroad."
Levin
realized
that
she
meant
his
wife,
and
did
not
know
what
answer
to
make.
"Come
along,
come
along
to
him!"
he
said.
But
as
soon
as
he
moved,
the
door
of
his
room
opened
and
Kitty
peepers
out.
Levin
cringe
both
from
shame
and
anger
with
his
wife,
who
had
put
herself
and
him
in
such
a
difficult
position;
but
Maryam
Nikolai
cringe
still
more.
She
positively
shrank
together
and
flushed
to
the
point
of
tears,
and
clutching
the
ends
of
her
apron
in
both
hands,
twisted
them
in
her
red
fingers
without
knowing
what
to
say
and
what
to
do.
For
the
first
instant
Levin
saw
an
expression
of
eager
curiosity
in
the
eyes
with
which
Kitty
looked
at
this
awful
woman,
so
incomprehensible
to
her;
but
it
lasted
only
a
single
instant.
"Well,
how
is
he?"
she
turned
to
her
husband
and
then
to
her.
"But
one
can't
go
on
talking
in
the
passage
like
this!"'
Levin
said,
looking
angrily
at
a
gentleman
who
walked
jauntily
at
that
instant
across
the
corridor,
as
though
about
his
affairs.
"Well
then,
come
in,"
said
Kitty,
turning
to
Maryam
Nikolai
who
had
recovered
herself,
but
noticing
her
husband's
face
of
dismay,
"or
go
on;
go,
and
then
come
for
me,"
she
said,
and
went
back
into
the
room.
Levin
went
to
his
brother's
room.
He
had
not
in
the
least
expected
what
he
saw
and
felt
in
his
brother's
room.
He
had
expected
to
find
him
in
the
same
state
of
self-deception.
which
he
had
heard
was
so
frequent
with
the
consumptive;
and
which
had
struck
him
so
much
during
his
brother's
visit
in
the
autumn.
He
had
expected
to
find
the
physical
signs
of
the
approach
of
death
more
marked-down
weakness,
greater
emaciation.
but
still
almost
the
same
condition
of
things.
He
had
expected
himself
to
feel
the
same
distress
at
the
loss
of
the
brother
he
loved
and
the
same
horror
in
face
of
death
as
he
had
felt
then,
only
in
a
greater
degree.
And
he
had
prepared
himself
for
this;
but
he
found
something
utterly
different.
In
a
little
dirty
room
with
the
painted
panels
of
its
walls
filthy
with
spittoon
and
conversation
audible
through
the
thin
partition
from
the
next
room,
in
a
stifling
atmosphere
saturated
with
impurities.
on
a
bedstraw
moved
away
from
the
wall,
there
lay
covered
with
a
quilt,
a
body.
One
arm
of
this
body
was
above
the
quilt,
and
the
wrist,
huge
as
a
rake-off
was
attached,
inconclusive
it
seemed,
to
the
thin,
long
bone
of
the
arm
smooth
from
the
beginning
to
the
middle.
The
head
lay
sideways
on
the
pillow.
Levin
could
see
the
scanty
locks
wet
with
sweat
on
the
temples
and
tense,
transparent.
forehead.
"It
cannot
be
that
that
fearful
body
was
my
brother
Nikolayenko
thought
Levin.
But
he
went
closer,
saw
the
face,
and
doubt
became
impossible.
In
spite
of
the
terrible
change
in
the
face,
Levin
had
only
to
glance
at
those
eager
eyes
raised
at
his
approach,
only
to
catch
the
faint
movement
of
the
mouth
under
the
sticky
mustache,
to
realize
the
terrible
truth
that
this
death-mask
body
was
his
living
brother.
The
glittering
eyes
looked
sternly
and
reproachfully
at
his
brother
as
he
drew
near.
And
immediately
this
glance
established
a
living
relationship
between
living
men.
Levin
immediately
felt
the
reproach
in
the
eyes
fixed
on
him,
and
felt
remorse
at
his
own
happiness.
When
Konstantin
took
him
by
the
hand,
Nikolay
smiled.
The
smile
was
faint,
scarcely
perceptibly
and
in
spite
of
the
smile
the
stern
expression
of
the
eyes
was
unchanged.
"You
did
not
expect
to
find
me
like
this,"
he
articulated
with
effort.
"Yes
...
no,"
said
Levin,
hesitating
over
his
words.
"How
was
it
you
didn't
let
me
know
before,
that
is,
at
the
time
of
my
weddings
I
made
inquiries
in
all
directions."
He
had
to
talk
so
as
not
to
be
silent,
and
he
did
not
know
what
to
say,
especially
as
his
brother
made
no
reply,
and
simply
stared
without
dropping
his
eyes,
and
evidently
penetrated
to
the
inner
meaning
of
each
word.
Levin
told
his
brother
that
his
wife
had
come
with
him.
Nikolay
expressed
pleasure,
but
said
he
was
afraid
of
frightening
her
by
his
condition.
A
silence
followed.
Suddenly
Nikolay
stirred,
and
began
to
say
something.
Levin
expected
something
of
peculiar
gravity
and
importance
from
the
expression
of
his
face,
but
Nikolay
began
speaking
of
his
health.
He
found
fault
with
the
doctor,
regretting
he
had
not
a
celebrated
Moscow
doctor.
Levin
saw
that
he
still
hoped.
Seizing
the
first
moment
of
silence,
Levin
got
up,
anxious
to
escape,
if
only
for
an
instant,
from
his
agonizing
emotion,
and
said
that
he
would
go
and
fetch
his
wife.
"Very
well,
and
I'll
tell
her
to
tidy
up
here.
It's
dirty
and
stinking
here,
I
expect.
Maryam
clear
up
the
room,"
the
sick
man
said
with
effort.
"Oh,
and
when
you've
cleared
up,
go
away
yourself,"
he
added,
looking
inquiry
at
his
brother.
Levin
made
no
answer.
Going
out
into
the
corridor,
he
stopped
short.
He
had
said
he
would
fetch
his
wife,
but
now,
taking
stock
of
the
emotion
he
was
feeling,
he
decided
that
he
would
try
on
the
contrary
to
persuade
her
not
to
go
in
to
the
sick
man.
"Why
should
she
suffer
as
I
am
sufferings
he
thought.
"Well,
how
is
he?"
Kitty
asked
with
a
frightened
face.
"Oh,
it's
awful,
it's
awful!
What
did
you
come
for?"
said
Levin.
Kitty
was
silent
for
a
few
seconds,
looking
timidly
and
ruefully
at
her
husband;
then
she
went
up
and
took
him
by
the
elbow
with
both
hands.
"Kotch"
take
me
to
him;
it
will
be
easier
for
us
to
bear
it
together.
You
only
take
me,
take
me
to
him,
please,
and
go
away,"
she
said.
"You
must
understand
that
for
me
to
see
you,
and
not
to
see
him,
is
far
more
painful.
There
I
might
be
a
help
to
you
and
to
him.
Please,
let
me!"
she
bespangled
her
husband,
as
though
the
happiness
of
her
life
depended
on
it.
Levin
was
obliged
to
agree,
and
regaining
his
composure,
and
completely
forgetting
about
Maryam
Nikolai
by
now,
he
went
again
in
to
his
brother
with
Kitty.
Stepping
lightly,
and
continually
glancing
at
her
husband,
showing
him
a
valour.
and
sympathetic
face,
Kitty
went
into
the
sick.
and,
turning
without
haste,
noisely
closed
the
door.
With
inaudible
steps
she
went
quickly
to
the
sick
man's
bedside,
and
going
up
so
that
he
had
not
to
turn
his
head,
she
immediately
clasped
in
her
fresh
young
hand
the
skeleton
of
his
huge
hand,
pressed
it,
and
began
speaking
with
that
soft
eagerness,
sympathetic
and
not
jarring.
which
is
peculiar
to
women.
"We
have
met,
though
we
were
not
acquainted,
at
Soder
she
said.
"You
never
thought
I
was
to
be
your
sister?'
"You
would
not
have
recognized
me?"
he
said,
with
a
radiant
smile
at
her
entrance.
"Yes,
I
should.
What
a
good
thing
you
let
us
know"
Not
a
day
has
passed
that
Kostyra,
has
not
mentioned
you,
and
been
anxious."
But
the
sick
man's
interest
did
not
last
long.
Before
she
had
finished
speaking,
there
had
come
back
into
his
face
the
stern,
reproachful
expression
of
the
dying
man's
envy
of
the
living.
"I
am
afraid
you
are
not
quite
comfortable
here,"
she
said,
turning
away
from
his
fixed
stare,
and
looking
about
the
room.
"We
must
ask
about
another
room,"
she
said
to
her
husband,
"so
that
we
might
be

Levin
could
not
look
calmly
at
his
brother;
he
could
not
himself
be
natural
and
calm
in
his
presence.
When
he
went
in
to
the
sick
man,
his
eyes
and
his
attention
were
unconsciously
dimmed,
and
he
did
not
see
and
did
not
distinguish
the
details
of
his
brother's
position.
He
smelt
the
awful
odor,
saw
the
dirt,
disorder,
and
miserable
condition,
and
heard
the
groans,
and
felt
that
nothing
could
be
done
to
help.
It
never
entered
his
head
to
analyze
the
details
of
the
sick
man's
situation,
to
consider
how
that
body
was
lying
under
the
quilt,
how
those
emaciated
legs
and
thighs
and
spine
were
lying
huddled
up,
and
whether
they
could
not
be
made
more
comfortable,
whether
anything
could
not
be
done
to
make
things,
if
not
better,
at
least
less
bad.
It
made
his
blood
run
cold
when
he
began
to
think
of
all
these
details.
He
was
absolutely
convinced
that
nothing
could
be
done
to
prolong
his
brother's
life
or
to
relieve
his
suffering.
But
a
sense
of
his
regarding
all
aid
as
out
of
the
question
was
felt
by
the
sick
man,
and
exasperated
him.
And
this
made
it
still
more
painful
for
Levin.
To
be
in
the
sick.
was
agony
to
him,
not
to
be
there
still
worse.
And
he
was
continually,
on
various
pretexts,"
going
out
of
the
room,
and
coming
in
again,
because
he
was
unable
to
remain
alone.
But
Kitty
thought,
and
felt,
and
acted
quite
differently.
On
seeing
the
sick
man,
she
pitied
him.
And
pity
in
her
womanly
heart
did
not
arouse
at
all
that
feeling
of
horror
and
loathing
that
it
aroused
in
her
husband,
but
a
desire
to
act,
to
find
out
all
the
details
of
his
state,
and
to
remedy
them.
And
since
she
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
it
was
her
duty
to
help
him,
she
had
no
doubt
either
that
it
was
possible,
and
immediately
set
to
work.
The
very
details,
the
mere
thought
of
which
reduced
her
husband
to
terror,
immediately
engaged
her
attention.
She
sent
for
the
doctor,
sent
to
the
chemist,
set
the
maid
who
had
come
with
her
and
Maryam
Nikolai
to
sweep
and
dust
and
null
she
herself
washed
up
something,
washed
out
something
else,
laid
something
under
the
quilt.
Something
was
by
her
directions
brought
into
the
sick.
something
else
was
carried
out.
She
herself
went
several
times
to
her
room,
regardless
of
the
men
she
met
in
the
corridor,
got
out
and
brought
in
sheets,
pillow
cases,
towels,
and
shirts.
The
waiter,
who
was
busy
with
a
party
of
engineers
dining
in
the
dining
hall,
came
several
times
with
an
irate
countenance
in
answer
to
her
summons,
and
could
not
avoid
carrying
out
her
orders,
as
she
gave
them
with
such
gracious
insistence
that
there
was
no
evading
her.
Levin
did
not
approve
of
all
this;
he
did
not
believe
it
would
be
of
any
good
to
the
patient.
Above
all,
he
feared
the
patient
would
be
angry
at
it.
But
the
sick
man,
though
he
seemed
and
was
indifferent
about
it,
was
not
angry,
but
only
abassador
and
on
the
whole
as
it
were
interested
in
what
she
was
doing
with
him.
Coming
back
from
the
doctor
to
whom
Kitty
had
sent
him,
Levin,
on
opening
the
door,
came
upon
the
sick
man
at
the
instant
when,
by
Kitty,
directions,
they
were
changing
his
linen.
The
long
white
ridge
of
his
spine,
with
the
huge,
prominent
shoulder
blades
and
jutting
ribs
and
vertebrae,
was
bare,
and
Maryam
Nikolai
and
the
waiter
were
struggling
with
the
sleeve
of
the
night
shirt,
and
could
not
get
the
long,
limp
arm
into
it.
Kitty,
hurriedly
closing
the
door
after
Levin,
was
not
looking
that
way;
but
the
sick
man
groaned,
and
she
moved
rapidly
towards
him.
"Make
haste,"
she
said.
"Oh,
don't
you
come,"
said
the
sick
man
angrily.
"I'll
do
it
my
myself:
"What
say?"
queried
Maryam
Nikolai
But
Kitty
heard
and
saw
he
was
ashamed
and
uncomfortable
at
being
naked
before
her.
"I'm
not
looking,
I'm
not
looking"
she
said,
putting
the
arm
in.
"Marzanna,"
Nikolai
you
come
this
side,
you
do
it,"
she
added.
"Please
go
for
me,
there's
a
little
bottle
in
my
small
bag,"
she
said,
turning
to
her
husband,
"you
know,
in
the
side
pocket;
bring
it,
please,
and
meanwhile
they'll
finish
clearing
up
here."
Returning
with
the
bottle,
Levin
found
the
sick
man
settled
comfortably
and
everything
about
him
completely
changed.
The
heavy
smell
was
replaced
by
the
smell
of
aromatic
vinegar,
which
Kitty
with
pouting
lips
and
puffed.
rosy
cheeks
was

through
a
little
pipe.
There
was
no
dust
visible
anywhere,
a
rug
was
laid
by
the
bedside.
On
the
table
stood
medicine
bottles
and
decanters
tidily
arranged,
and
the
linen
needed
was
folded
up
there,
and
Kitty,
_but
angle
On
the
other
table
by
the
patient's
bed
there
were
candles
and
drink
and
powders.
The
sick
man
himself,
washed
and
combed,
lay
in
clean
sheets
on
high
raised
pillows,
in
a
clean
night-sighting
with
a
white
collar
about
his
astoundingly
thin
neck,
and
with
a
new
expression
of
hope
looked
fixedly
at
Kitty.
The
doctor
brought
by
Levin,
and
found
by
him
at
the
club,
was
not
the
one
who
had
been
attending
Nikolay
Levin,
as
the
patient
was
dissatisfied
with
him.
The
new
doctor
took
up
a
stethoscope
and
sounded
the
patient,
shook
his
head,
prescribed
medicine,
and
with
extreme
minutes
explained
first
how
to
take
the
medicine
and
then
what
diet
was
to
be
kept
to.
He
advised
eggs,
raw
or
hardly
cooked,
and
seltzer
water,
with
warm
milk
at
a
certain
temperature.
When
the
doctor
had
gone
away
the
sick
man
said
something
to
his
brother,
of
which
Levin
could
distinguish
only
the
last
words:
"Your
Katydids
By
the
expression
with
which
he
gazed
at
her,
Levin
saw
that
he
was
praising
her.
He
called
indeed
to
Katya,
as
he
called
her.
"I'm
much
better
already,"
he
said.
"Why,
with
you
I
should
have
got
well
long
ago.
How
nice
it
isue.
he
took
her
hand
and
drew
it
towards
his
lips,
but
as
though
afraid
she
would
dislike
it
he
changed
his
mind,
let
it
go,
and
only
stroked
it.
Kitty
took
his
hand
in
both
hers
and
pressed
it.
"Now
turn
me
over
on
the
left
side
and
go
to
bed,"
he
said.
No
one
could
make
out
what
he
said
but
Kittyhawk
she
alone
understood.
She
understood
because
she
was
all
the
while
mentally
keeping
watch
on
what
he
needed.
"On
the
other
side,"
she
said
to
her
husband,
"he
always
sleeps
on
that
side.
Turn
him
over,
it's
so
disagreeable
calling
the
servants.
I'm
not
strong
enough.
Can
you?"
she
said
to
Maryam
Nikolai
"I'm
afraid
not,"
answered
Maryam
Nikolai
Terrible
as
it
was
to
Levin
to
put
his
arms
round
that
terrible
body,
to
take
hold
of
that
under
the
quilt,
of
which
he
preferred
to
know
nothing,
under
his
wife's
influence
he
made
his
resolute
face
that
she
knew
so
well,
and
putting
his
arms
into
the
bed
took
hold
of
the
body,
but
in
spite
of
his
own
strength
he
was
struck
by
the
strange
heaviness
of
those
powerless
limbs.
While
he
was
turning
him
over,
conscious
of
the
huge
emaciated
arm
about
his
neck,
Kitty
swiftly
and
noisely
turned
the
pillow,
beat
it
up
and
settled
in
it
the
sick
man's
head,
smoothing
back
his
hair,
which
was
sticking
again
to
his
moist
brow.
The
sick
man
kept
his
brother's
hand
in
his
own.
Levin
felt
that
he
meant
to
do
something
with
his
hand
and
was
pulling
it
somewhere.
Levin
yielded
with
a
sinking
heart:
yes,
he
drew
it
to
his
mouth
and
kissed
it.
Levin,
shaking
with
sobs
and
unable
to
articulate
a
word,
went
out
of
the
room.
Chapter
19
"Thou
hastaken
hid
these
things
from
the
wise
and
prudent,
and
hastaken
revealed
them
unto
babesiosis
So
Levin
thought
about
his
wife
as
he
talked
to
her
that
evening.
Levin
thought
of
the
text,
not
because
he
considered
himself
"wise
and
prudent."
He
did
not
so
consider
himself,
but
he
could
not
help
knowing
that
he
had
more
intellect
than
his
wife
and
Agag
Mihalowski
and
he
could
not
help
knowing
that
when
he
thought
of
death,
he
thought
with
all
the
force
of
his
intellect.
He
knew
too
that
the
brains
of
many
great
men,
whose
thoughts
he
had
read,
had
brooded
over
death
and
yet
knew
not
a
hundredth
part
of
what
his
wife
and
Agag
Mihalowski
knew
about
it.
Different
as
those
two
women
were,
Agag
Mihalowski
and
Katya,
as
his
brother
Nikolay
had
called
her,
and
as
Levin
particularly
liked
to
call
her
now,
they
were
quite
alike
in
this.
Both
knew,
without
a
shade
of
doubt,
what
sort
of
thing
life
was
and
what
was
death,
and
though
neither
of
them
could
have
answered,
and
would
even
not
have
understood
the
questions
that
presented
themselves
to
Levin,
both
had
no
doubt
of
the
significance
of
this
event,
and
were
precisely
alike
in
their
way
of
looking
at
it,
which
they
shared
with
millions
of
people.
The
proof
that
they
knew
for
a
certainty
the
nature
of
death
lay
in
the
fact
that
they
knew
without
a
second
of
hesitation
how
to
deal
with
the
dying,
and
were
not
frightened
of
them.
Levin
and
other
men
like
him,
though
they
could
have
said
a
great
deal
about
death,
obviously
did
not
know
this
since
they
were
afraid
of
death,
and
were
absolutely
at
a
loss
what
to
do
when
people
were
dying.
If
Levin
had
been
alone
now
with
his
brother
Nikolay,
he
would
have
looked
at
him
with
terror,
and
with
still
greater
terror
waited,
and
would
not
have
known
what
else
to
do.
More
than
that,
he
did
not
know
what
to
say,
how
to
look,
how
to
move.
To
talk
of
outside
things
seemed
to
him
shocking,
impossible,
to
talk
of
death
and
depressing
subjects.
impossible.
To
be
silent,
also
impossible.
"If
I
look
at
him
he
will
think
I
am
studying
him,
I
am
afraid;
if
I
don't
look
at
him,
he'll
think
I'm
thinking
of
other
things.
If
I
walk
on
tiptoed
he
will
be
vexes
to
tread
firmly,
I'm
ashamed."
Kitty
evidently
did
not
think
of
herself,
and
had
no
time
to
think
about
herself:
she
was
thinking
about
him
because
she
knew
something,
and
all
went
well.
She
told
him
about
herself
even
and
about
her
wedding,
and
smiled
and
sympathized
with
him
and
petted
him,
and
talked
of
cases
of
recovery
and
all
went
well;
so
then
she
must
know.
The
proof
that
her
behavior
and
Agag
Mihalowski
was
not
instinctive,
animal,
irrational,
was
that
apart
from
the
physical
treatment,
the
relief
of
suffering,
both
Agag
Mihalowski
and
Kitty
required
for
the
dying
man
something
else
more
important
than
the
physical
treatment,
and
something
which
had
nothing
in
common
with
physical
conditions.
Agag
Mihalowski
speaking
of
the
man
just
dead,
had
said:
"Well,
thank
God,
he
took
the
sacrament
and
received
absolutism
God
grant
each
one
of
us
such
a
death."
Katya
in
just
the
same
way,
besides
all
her
care
about
linen,
bedsores.
drink,
found
time
the
very
first
day
to
persuade
the
sick
man
of
the
necessity
of
taking
the
sacrament
and
receiving
absolutism
On
getting
back
from
the
sick.
to
their
own
two
rooms
for
the
night,
Levin
sat
with
hanging
head
not
knowing
what
to
do.
Not
to
speak
of
supper,
of
preparing
for
bed,
of
considering
what
they
were
going
to
do,
he
could
not
even
talk
to
his
wife;
he
was
ashamed
to.
Kitty,
on
the
contrary,
was
more
active
than
usual.
She
was
even
livelier
than
usual.
She
ordered
supper
to
be
brought,
herself
unpacked
their
things,
and
herself
helped
to
make
the
beds,
and
did
not
even
forget
to
sprinkle
them
with
Persian
powder.
She
showed
that
alertness.
that
swiftness
of
reflection
comes
out
in
men
before
a
battle,
in
conflict,
in
the
dangerous
and
decisive
moments
of
life-altering
moments
when
a
man
shows
once
and
for
all
his
value,
and
that
all
his
past
has
not
been
wasted
but
has
been
a
preparation
for
these
moments.
Everything
went
rapidly
in
her
hands,
and
before
it
was
twelve
o'clock
all
their
things
were
arranged
cleanly
and
tidily
in
her
rooms,
in
such
a
way
that
the
hotel
rooms
seemed
like
home:
the
beds
were
made,
brushes,
combs,
looking-glasses
were
put
out,
table
napkins
were
spread.
Levin
felt
that
it
was
unpardonable
to
eat,
to
sleep,
to
talk
even
now,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
every
movement
he
made
was
unseemly.
She
arranged
the
brushes,
but
she
did
it
all
so
that
there
was
nothing
shocking
in
it.
They
could
neither
of
them
eat,
however,
and
for
a
long
while
they
could
not
sleep,
and
did
not
even
go
to
bed.
"I
am
very
glad
I
persuaded
him
to
receive
extreme
unction
tomorrow,"
she
said,
sitting
in
her
dressing
jacket
before
her
folding
looking
glass,
combing
her
soft,
fragrant
hair
with
a
fine
comb.
"I
have
never
seen
it,
but
I
know,
mammal
has
told
me,
there
are
prayers
said
for
recovery."
"Do
you
suppose
he
can
possibly
recover?'
said
Levin,
watching
a
slender
tresses
at
the
back
of
her
round
little
head
that
was
continually
hidden
when
she
passed
the
comb
through
the
front.
"I
asked
the
doctor;
he
said
he
couldn't
live
more
than
three
days.
But
can
they
be
sure?
I'm
very
glad,
anyway,
that
I
persuaded
him,"
she
said,
looking
askance
at
her
husband
through
her
hair.
"Anything
is
possible,"
she
added
with
that
peculiar,
rather
sly
expression
that
was
always
in
her
face
when
she
spoke
of
religion.
Since
their
conversation
about
religion
when
they
were
engaged
neither
of
them
had
ever
started
a
discussion
of
the
subject,
but
she
performed
all
the
ceremonies
of
going
to
church,
saying
her
prayers,
and
so
on,
always
with
the
unveil
conviction
that
this
ought
to
be
so.
In
spite
of
his
assertion
to
the
contrary,
she
was
firmly
persuaded
that
he
was
as
much
a
Christian
as
she,
and
indeed
a
far
better
one;
and
all
that
he
said
about
it
was
simply
one
of
his
absurd
masculine
freaks,
just
as
he
would
say
about
her
_but
angle
that
good
people
patch
holes,
but
that
she
cut
them
on
purpose,
and
so
on.
"Yes,
you
see
this
woman,
Maryam
Nikolai
did
not
know
how
to
manage
all
this,"
said
Levin.
"And
...
I
must
own
I'm
very,
very
glad
you
came.
You
are
such
purity
that:
He
took
her
hand
and
did
not
kiss
it
(to
kiss
her
hand
in
such
closeness
to
death
seemed
to
him
improper,
he
merely
squeezed
it
with
a
penitent
air,
looking
at
her
brightening
eyes.
"It
would
have
been
miserable
for
you
to
be
alone,"
she
said,
and
lifting
her
hands
which
hid
her
cheeks
flushing
with
pleasure,
twisted
her
coil
of
hair
on
the
naphta
of
her
neck
and
pinned
it
there.
"No,"
she
went
on,
"she
did
not
know
how:
Luckily,
I
learned
a
lot
at
Soder
"Surely
there
are
not
people
there
so
illed
"Worthwhile
"What's
so
awful
to
me
is
that
I
can't
see
him
as
he
was
when
he
was
young.
You
would
not
believe
how
charming
he
was
as
a
youth,
but
I
did
not
understand
him
then."
"I
can
quite-good
quite
believe
it.
How
I
feel
that
we
might
have
been
friends"
she
said;
and,
distressed
at
what
she
had
said,
she
looked
round
at
her
husband,
and
tears
came
into
her
eyes.
"Yes,
_nicknamed
have
beenclever,
he
said
mournfully.
"He's
just
one
of
those
people
of
whom
they
say
they're
not
for
this
world."
"But
we
have
many
days
before
us;
we
must
go
to
bed,"
said
Kitty,
glancing
at
her
tiny
watch.
Chapter
20
The
next
day
the
sick
man
received
the
sacrament
and
extreme
unction.
During
the
ceremony
Nikolay
Levin
prayed
fervently.
His
great
eyes,
fastened
on
the
holy
image
that
was
set
out
on
a
card
table
covered
with
a
colored
napkin,"
expressed
such
passionate
prayer
and
hope
that
it
was
awful
to
Levin
to
see
it.
Levin
knew
that
this
passionate
prayer
and
hope
would
only
make
him
feel
more
bitterly
parting
from
the
life
he
so
loved.
Levin
knew
his
brother
and
the
workings
of
his
intellectual
he
knew
that
his
unbelievable
came
not
from
life
being
easier
for
him
without
faith,
but
had
grown
up
because
step
by
step
the
contemporary
scientific
interpretation
of
natural
phenomena
crushed
out
the
possibility
of
faith;
and
so
he
knew
that
his
present
return
was
not
a
legitimate
one,
brought
about
by
way
of
the
same
working
of
his
intellect,
but
simply
a
temporary,
interested
return
to
faith
in
a
desperate
hope
of
recovery.
Levin
knew
too
that
Kitty
had
strengthened
his
hope
by
accounts
of
the
marvelous
recoveries
she
had
heard
of.
Levin
knew
all
this;
and
it
was
agonizingly
painful
to
him
to
behold
the
supplied
hopeful
eyes
and
the
emaciated
wrist,
lifted
with
difficulty,
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
the
tense
brow-beat,
and
the
prominent
shoulders
and
hollow,
gasping
chest,
which
one
could
not
feel
consistent
with
the
life
the
sick
man
was
praying
for.
During
the
sacrament
Levin
did
what
he,
an
unbeliever,
had
done
a
thousand
times.
He
said,
addressing
God,
"If
Thou
doze
exist,
make
this
man
to
recover"
(of
course
this
same
thing
has
been
repeated
many
times).
"and
Thou
wilt
save
him
and
me."
After
extreme
unction
the
sick
man
became
suddenly
much
better.
He
did
not
cough
once
in
the
course
of
an
hour,
smiled,
kissed
Kitty,
hand,
thanking
her
with
tears,
and
said
he
was
comfortable,
free
from
pain,
and
that
he
felt
strong
and
had
an
appetite.
He
even
raised
himself
when
his
soup
was
brought,
and
asked
for
a
cutlet
as
well.
Hopeman
ill
as
he
was,
obvious
as
it
was
at
the
first
glance
that
he
could
not
recover,
Levin
and
Kitty
were
for
that
hour
both
in
the
same
state
of
excitement,
happy,
though
fearful
of
being
mistaken.
"Is
he
better?"
"Yes,
much."
"It's
wonderful."
"There's
nothing
wonderful
in
it."
"Anywhere
he's
better,"
they
said
in
a
whisper,
smiling
to
one
another.
This
self-deception.
was
not
of
long
duration.
The
sick
man
fell
into
a
quiet
sleep,
but
he
was
waked
up
half
an
hour
later
by
his
cough.
And
all
at
once
every
hope
vanished
in
those
about
him
and
in
himself.
The
reality
of
his
suffering
crushed
all
hopes
in
Levin
and
Kitty
and
in
the
sick
man
himself,
leaving
no
doubt,
no
memory
even
of
past
hopes.
Without
referring
to
what
he
had
believed
in
half
an
hour
before,
as
though
ashamed
even
to
recall
it,
he
asked
for
iodine
to
inhale
in
a
bottle
covered
with
perforated
paper.
Levin
gave
him
the
bottle,
and
the
same
look
of
passionate
hope
with
which
he
had
taken
the
sacrament
was
now
fastened
on
his
brother,
demanding
from
him
the
confirmation
of
the
doctor's
words
that
inhaling
iodine
worked
wonders.
"Is
Katya
not
here?"
he
gasped.
looking
round
while
Levin
reluctantly
assenting
to
the
doctor's
words.
"Nobel
so
I
can
say
it:
It
was
for
her
sake
I
went
through
that
farce.
She's
so
sweeten
but
you
and
I
can't
deceive
ourselves.
This
is
what
I
believe
in,"
he
said,
and,
squeezing
the
bottle
in
his
bony
hand,
he
began
breathing
over
it.
At
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
Levin
and
his
wife
were
drinking
tea
in
their
room
when
Maryam
Nikolai
ran
in
to
them
breathlessness
She
was
pale,
and
her
lips
were
quivers,"
"He
is
dying"
she
whispered.
"I'm
afraid
will
die
this
minute."
Both
of
them
ran
to
him.
He
was
sitting
raised
up
with
one
elbow
on
the
bed,
his
long
back
bent,
and
his
head
hanging
low.
"How
do
you
feel?"
Levin
asked
in
a
whisper,
after
a
silence.
"I
feel
I'm
setting
off,"
Nikolay
said
with
difficulty,
but
with
extreme
distinguish
screwing
the
words
out
of
himself.
He
did
not
raise
his
head,
but
simply
turned
his
eyes
upwards,
without
their
reaching
his
brother's
face.
"Katydids"
go
away!"
he
added.
Levin
jumped
up,
and
with
a
peremptory
whisper
made
her
go
out.
"I'm
setting
off,"
he
said
again.
"Why
do
you
think
so?"
said
Levin,
so
as
to
say
something.
"Because
I'm
setting
off,"
he
repeated,
as
though
he
had
a
liking
for
the
phrase.
"It's
the
end."
Maryam
Nikolai
went
up
to
him.
"You
had
better
lie
down;
you'd
be
easier,"
she
said.
"I
shall
lie
down
soon
enough,"
he
pronounced
slowly,
"when
I'm
dead,"
he
said
sarcastically,
wre
"Well,
you
can
lay
me
down
if
you
like."
Levin
laid
his
brother
on
his
back,
sat
down
beside
him,
and
gazed
at
his
face,
holding
his
breath.
The
dying
man
lay
with
closed
eyes,
but
the
muscles
twitcher,
from
time
to
time
on
his
forehead,
as
with
one
thinking
deeply
and
intensely.
Levin
involuntarily
thought
with
him
of
what
it
was
that
was
happening
to
him
now,
but
in
spite
of
all
his
mental
efforts
to
go
along
with
him
he
saw
by
the
expression
of
that
calm,
stern
face
that
for
the
dying
man
all
was
growing
clearer
and
clearer
that
was
still
as
dark
as
ever
for
Levin.
"Yes,
yes,
so,"
the
dying
man
articulated
slowly
at
intervals.
"Wait
a
little."
He
was
silent.
"Right,"
he
pronounced
all
at
once
reassuringly,
as
though
all
were
solved
for
him.
"O
Lord"
he
murmured,
and
sighed
deeply.
Maryam
Nikolai
felt
his
feet.
"They're
getting
cold,"
she
whispered.
For
a
long
while,
a
very
long
while
it
seemed
to
Levin,
the
sick
man
lay
motionless.
But
he
was
still
alive,
and
from
time
to
time
he
sighed.
Levin
by
now
was
exhausted
from
mental
strain.
He
felt
that,
with
no
mental
effort,
could
he
understand
what
it
was
that
was
_security,
He
could
not
even
think
of
the
problem
of
death
itself,
but
with
no
will
of
his
own
thoughts
kept
coming
to
him
of
what
he
had
to
do
next;
closing
the
dead
man's
eyes,
dressing
him,
ordering
the
coffin.
And,
strange
to
say,
he
felt
utterly
cold,
and
was
not
conscious
of
sorrow
nor
of
loss,
less
still
of
pity
for
his
brother.
If
he
had
any
feeling
for
his
brother
at
that
moment,
it
was
envy
for
the
knowledge
the
dying
man
had
now
that
he
could
not
have.
A
long
time
more
he
sat
over
him
so,
continually
expecting
the
end.
But
the
end
did
not
come.
The
door
opened
and
Kitty
appeared.
Levin
got
up
to
stop
her.
But
at
the
moment
he
was
getting
up,
he
caught
the
sound
of
the
dying
man
stirring.
"Don't
go
away,"
said
Nikolay
and
held
out
his
hand.
Levin
gave
him
his,
and
angrily
waved
to
his
wife
to
go
away.
With
the
dying
man's
hand
in
his
hand,
he
sat
for
half
an
hour,
an
hour,
another
hour.
He
did
not
think
of
death
at
all
now.
He
wondered
what
Kitty
was
doing;
who
lived
in
the
next
room;
whether
the
doctor
lived
in
a
house
of
his
own.
He
longed
for
food
and
for
sleep.
He
cautiously
drew
away
his
hand
and
felt
the
feet.
The
feet
were
cold,
but
the
sick
man
was
still
breathing.
Levin
tried
again
to
move
away
on
tiptoed
but
the
sick
man
stirred
again
and
said:
"Don't
go."
---------------
The
dawn
came?
the
sick
man's
condition
was
unchanged.
Levin
stealthily
withdrew
his
hand,
and
without
looking
at
the
dying
man,
went
off
to
his
own
room
and
went
to
sleep.
When
he
woke
up,
instead
of
news
of
his
brother's
death
which
he
expected,
he
learned
that
the
sick
man
had
returned
to
his
earlier
condition.
He
had
begun
sitting
up
again,
coughing,
had
begun
eating
again,
talking
again,
and
again
had
ceased
to
talk
of
death,
again
had
begun
to
express
hope
of
his
recovery,
and
had
become
more
irritable
and
more
gloomy
than
ever.
No
one,
neither
his
brother
nor
Kitty,
could
soothe
him.
He
was
angry
with
everyone,
and
said
nasty
things
to
everyone,
reproached
everyone
for
his
suffers
and
insisted
that
they
should
get
him
a
celebrated
doctor
from
Moscow.
To
all
inquiries
made
him
as
to
how
he
felt,
he
made
the
same
answer
with
an
expression
of
vindictive
null
"I'm
suffering
horribly.
intolerance
The
sick
man
was
suffering
more
and
more,
especially
from
bedsores.
which
it
was
impossible
now
to
remedy,
and
grew
more
and
more
angry
with
everyone
about
him,
blaming
them
for
everything,
and
especially
for
not
having
brought
him
a
doctor
from
Moscow.
Kitty
tried
in
every
possible
way
to
relieve
him,
to
soothe
him;
but
it
was
all
in
vain,
and
Levin
saw
that
she
herself
was
exhausted
both
physically
and
morally,
though
she
would
not
admit
it.
The
sense
of
death,
which
had
been
evoked
in
all
by
his
taking
leave
of
life
on
the
night
when
he
had
sent
for
his
brother,
was
broken
up.
Everyone
knew
that
he
must
inevitably
die
soon,
that
he
was
half
dead
already.
Everyone
wished
for
nothing
but
that
he
should
die
as
soon
as
possible,
and
everyone,
concealing
this,
gave
him
medicines,
tried
to
find
remedies
and
doctors,
and
deceived
him
and
themselves
and
each
other.
All
this
was
falsehood,"
disgusting,
irreverent
deceit.
And
owing
to
the
bent
of
his
character,
and
because
he
loved
the
dying
man
more
than
anyone
else
did,
Levin
was
most
painfully
conscious
of
this
deceit.
Levin,
who
had
long
been
possessed
by
the
idea
of
reconciling
his
brothers,
at
least
in
face
of
death,
had
written
to
his
brother,
Sergey
Ivanovo.
and
having
received
an
answer
from
him,
he
read
this
letter
to
the
sick
man.
Sergey
Ivanovo.
wrote
that
he
could
not
come
himself,
and
in
touching
terms
he
begged
his
brother's
forgiveness.
The
sick
man
said
nothing.
"What
am
I
to
write
to
him?"
said
Levin.
"I
hope
you
are
not
angry
with
him?"
"No,
not
the
least"
Nikolay
answered,
vexed
at
the
question.
"Tell
him
to
send
me
a
doctor."
Three
more
days
of
agony
follower
the
sick
man
was
still
in
the
same
condition.
The
sense
of
longing
for
his
death
was
felt
by
everyone
now
at
the
mere
sight
of
him,
by
the
waiters
and
the
hotel-like
and
all
the
people
staying
in
the
hotel,
and
the
doctor
and
Maryam
Nikolai
and
Levin
and
Kitty.
The
sick
man
alone
did
not
express
this
feeling,
but
on
the
contrary
was
furious
at
their
not
getting
him
doctors,
and
went
on
taking
medicine
and
talking
of
life.
Only
at
rare
moments,
when
the
opium
gave
him
an
instant,
relief
from
the
never-completed
pain,
he
would
sometimes,
half
asleep,
utter
what
was
ever
more
intense
in
his
heart
than
in
all
the
others:
"Oh,
if
it
were
only
the
end!"
oracle
"When
will
it
be
over?"
His
suffers
steadily
growing
more
intense,
did
their
work
and
prepared
him
for
death.
There
was
no
position
in
which
he
was
not
in
pain,
there
was
not
a
minute
in
which
he
was
unconscious
of
it,
not
a
limb,
not
a
part
of
his
body
that
did
not
ache
and
cause
him
agony.
Even
the
memories,
the
impressions,
the
thoughts
of
this
body
awakened
in
him
now
the
same
aversion
as
the
body
itself.
The
sight
of
other
people,
their
remarks,
his
own
reminiscences,
everything
was
for
him
a
source
of
agony.
Those
about
him
felt
this,
and
instinctively
did
not
allow
themselves
to
move
freely,
to
talk,
to
express
their
wishes
before
him.
All
his
life
was
merged
in
the
one
feeling
of
suffering
and
desire
to
be
rid
of
it.
There
was
evidently
coming
over
him
that
revulsion
that
would
make
him
look
upon
death
as
the
goal
of
his
desires,
as
happiness.
Hitherto
each
individual
desire,
aroused
by
suffering
or
privation.
such
as
hunger,
fatigue,
thirst.
had
been
satisfied
by
some
bodily
function
giving
pleasure.
But
now
no
physical
craving
or
suffering
received
relief,
and
the
effort
to
relieve
them
only
caused
fresh
suffering.
And
so
all
desires
were
merged
in
one-12th
desire
to
be
rid
of
all
his
sufferings
and
their
source,
the
body.
But
he
had
no
words
to
express
this
desire
of
deliverance,
and
so
he
did
not
speak
of
it,
and
from
habit
asked
for
the
satisfaction
of
desires
which
could
not
now
be
satisfied.
"Turn
me
over
on
the
other
side,"
he
would
say,
and
immediately
after
he
would
ask
to
be
turned
back
again
as
before.
"Give
me
some
broth.
Take
away
the
broth.
Talk
of
something:
why
are
you

And
directly
they
began
to
talk
he
would
close
his
eyes,
and
would
show
wearing
indifference,
and
loathsome
On
the
tenth
day
from
their
arrival
at
the
town,
Kitty
was
unwholesome
She
suffered
from
headache
and
sickness,
and
she
could
not
get
up
all
the
morning.
The
doctor
opined
that
the
indisputable
arose
from
fatigue
and
excitement,
and
prescribed
rest.
After
dinner,
however,
Kitty
got
up
and
went
as
usual
with
her
work
to
the
sick
man.
He
looked
at
her
sternly
when
she
came
in,
and
smiled
contemptuously
when
she
said
she
had
been
unwholesome
That
day
he
was
continually
blowing
his
nose,
and
groaning

"How
do
you
feel?"
she
asked
him.
"Worthwhile

articulated
with
difficulty.
"In

"In

"Evian
"It
will
be
over
today,
you
will
see,"
said
Maryam
Nikolai
Though
it
was
said
in
a
whisper,
the
sick
man,
whose
hearing
Levin
had
noticed
was
very
keen,
must
have
heard.
Levin
said
hush
to
her,
and
looked
round
at
the
sick
man.
Nikolay
had
heard?
but
these
words
produced
no
effect
on
him.
His
eyes
had
still
the
same
intense,
reproachful
look.
"Why
do
you
think
so?"
Levin
asked
her,
when
she
had
followed
him
into
the
corridor.
"He
has
begun
picking
at
himself,"
said
Maryam
Nikolai
"How
do
you
mean?"
"Like
this,"
she
said,
tugging
at
the
folds
of
her
woolen
skirt.
Levin
noticed,
indeed,
that
all
that
day
the
patient
pulled
at
himself,
as
it
were,
trying
to
snatch
something
away.
Maryam
Nikolai
prediction
came
true.
Towards
night
the
sick
man
was
not
able
to
lift
his
hands,
and
could
only
gaze
before
him
with
the
same
intensely
concentrated
expression
in
his
eyes.
Even
when
his
brother
or
Kitty
bent
over
him,
so
that
he
could
see
them,
he
looked
just
the
same.
Kitty
sent
for
the
priest
to
read
the
prayer
for
the
dying.
While
the
priest
was
reading
it,
the
dying
man
did
not
show
any
sign
of
life;
his
eyes
were
closed.
Levin,
Kitty,
and
Maryam
Nikolai
stood
at
the
bedside.
The
priest
had
not
quite
finished
reading
the
prayer
when
the
dying
man
stretched,
sighed,
and
opened
his
eyes.
The
priest,
on
finishing
the
prayer,
put
the
cross
to
the
cold
forehead,
then
slowly
returned
it
to
the
stand,
and
after
standing
for
two
minutes
more
in
silence,
he
touched
the
huge,
bloodless
hand
that
was
turning
cold.
"He
is
gone,"
said
the
priest,
and
would
have
moved
away;
but
suddenly
there
was
a
faint
stir
in
the
mustaches
of
the
dead
man
that
seemed
glued
together,
and
quite
distinctly
in
the
hush
they
heard
from
the
bottom
of
the
chest
the
sharply
defined
sounds:
"Not
quite
...
soon."
And
a
minute
later
the
face
brightened,
a
smile
came
out
under
the
mustachioed
and
the
women
who
had
gathered
round
began
carefully
laying
out
the
corpse.
The
sight
of
his
brother,
and
the
nearness
of
death,
revived
in
Levin
that
sense
of
horror
in
face
of
the
insoluble
enigma,
together
with
the
nearness
and
inevitability
of
death,
that
had
come
upon
him
that
autumn
evening
when
his
brother
had
come
to
him.
This
feeling
was
now
even
stronger
than
before;
even
less
than
before
did
he
feel
capable
of
apprehending
the
meaning
of
death,
and
its
inevitability
rose
up
before
him
more
terrible
than
ever.
But
now,
thanks
to
his
wife's
presence,
that
feeling
did
not
reduce
him
to
despair.
In
spite
of
death,
he
felt
the
need
of
life
and
love.
He
felt
that
love
saved
him
from
despair,
and
that
this
love,
under
the
menace
of
despair,
had
become
still
stronger
and
purest
The
one
mystery
of
death,
still
unsolved,
had
scarcely
passed
before
his
eyes,
when
another
mystery
had
arisen,
as
insoluble.
urging
him
to
love
and
to
life.
The
doctor
confirmed
his
suppositories
in
regard
to
Kitty.
Her
indisputable
was
a
symptom
that
she
was
with
child.
Chapter
21
From
the
moment
when
Alexey
Alexei
understood
from
his
interviews
with
Betsy
and
with
Stepan
Arkalyk
that
all
that
was
expected
of
him
was
to
leave
his
wife
in
peace,
without
burdening
her
with
his
presence,
and
that
his
wife
herself
desired
this,
he
felt
so
distraught
that
he
could
come
to
no
decision
of
himself;
he
did
not
know
himself
what
he
wanted
now,
and
putting
himself
in
the
hands
of
those
who
were
so
pleased
to
interest
themselves
in
his
affairs,
he
met
everything
with
unqualified
assent.
It
was
only
when
Anna
had
left
his
house,
and
the
English
governess
sent
to
ask
him
whether
she
should
dine
with
him
or
separately,
that
for
the
first
time
he
clearly
comprehending
his
position,
and
was
appalled
by
it.
Most
difficult
of
all
in
this
position
was
the
fact
that
he
could
not
in
any
way
connect
and
reconcile
his
past
with
what
was
now.
It
was
not
the
past
when
he
had
lived
happily
with
his
wife
that
troubled
him.
The
transition
from
that
past
to
a
knowledge
of
his
wife's
unfamiliar
he
had
lived
through
miserably
already;
that
state
was
painful,
but
he
could
understand
it.
If
his
wife
had
then,
on
declaring
to
him
her
unfamiliar
left
him,
he
would
have
been
wounded,
unhappy,
but
he
would
not
have
been
in
the
hopeless
position-evening
to
himself.
which
he
felt
himself
now.
He
could
not
now
reconcile
his
immediate
past,
his
tenderness.
his
love
for
his
sick
wife,
and
for
the
other
man's
child
with
what
was
now
the
case,
that
is
with
the
fact
that,
as
it
were,
in
return
for
all
this
he
now
found
himself
alone,
put
to
shame,
a
laughing.
needed
by
no
one,
and
despised
by
everyone.
For
the
first
two
days
after
his
wife's
departure
Alexey
Alexei
received
applicants
for
assistance
and
his
chief
secretary,
drove
to
the
committee,
and
went
down
to
dinner
in
the
dining
room
as
usual.
Without
giving
himself
a
reason
for
what
he
was
doing,
he
strained
every
nerve
of
his
being
for
those
two
days,
simply
to
preserve
an
appearance
of
composure,
and
even
of
indifference.
Answering
inquiries
about
the
disposition
of
Anna
Arkalyk
rooms
and
belongings,
he
had
exercised
immense
self-control
to
appear
like
a
man
in
whose
eyes
what
had
occurred
was
not
unforeseen
nor
out
of
the
ordinary
course
of
events,
and
he
attained
his
aim:
no
one
could
have
detected
in
him
signs
of
despair.
But
on
the
second
day
after
her
departure,
when
Korneyev
gave
him
a
bill
from
a
fashionable
draperies,
shop,
which
Anna
had
forgotten
to
pay,
and
announced
that
the
clerk
from
the
shop
was
waiting,
Alexey
Alexei
told
him
to
show
the
clerk
up.
"Excuse
me,
your
excellent
for
venturing
to
trouble
you.
But
if
you
direct
us
to
apply
to
her
excellent
would
you
graciously
oblige
us
with
her
address?"
Alexey
Alexei
pondered,
as
it
seemed
to
the
clerk,
and
all
at
once,
turning
round,
he
sat
down
at
the
table.
Letting
his
head
sink
into
his
hands,
he
sat
for
a
long
while
in
that
position,
several
times
attempted
to
speak
and
stopped
short.
Korneyev
perceiving
his
master's
emotion,
asked
the
clerk
to
call
another
time.
Left
alone,
Alexey
Alexei
recognized
that
he
had
not
the
strength
to
keep
up
the
line
of
firmness
and
composure
any
longer.
He
gave
orders
for
the
carriage
that
was
awaiting
him
to
be
taken
back,
and
for
no
one
to
be
admitted,
and
he
did
not
go
down
to
dinner.
He
felt
that
he
could
not
endure
the
weight
of
universal
contempt
and
exasperation,
which
he
had
distinctly
seen
in
the
face
of
the
clerk
and
of
Korneyev
and
of
everyone,
without
exception,
whom
he
had
met
during
those
two
days.
He
felt
that
he
could
not
turn
aside
from
himself
the
hatred
of
men,
because
that
hatred
did
not
come
from
his
being
bad
(in
that
case
he
could
have
tried
to
be
better,
but
from
his
being
shamefully
and
repulsiveness
unhappy.
He
knew
that
for
this,
for
the
very
fact
that
his
heart
was
torn
with
grief,
they
would
be
merciless
to
him.
He
felt
that
men
would
crush
him
as
dogs
strangle
a
torn
dog
yelps
with
pain.
He
knew
that
his
sole
means
of
security
against
people
was
to
hide
his
wounds
from
them,
and
instinctively
he
tried
to
do
this
for
two
days,
but
now
he
felt
incapable
of
keeping
up
the
unequal
struggle.
His
despair
was
even
intensified
by
the
consciousness
that
he
was
utterly
alone
in
his
sorrow.
In
all
Petersburg
there
was
not
a
human
being
to
whom
he
could
express
what
he
was
feeling,
who
would
feel
for
him,
not
as
a
high
official,
not
as
a
member
of
society,
but
simply
as
a
suffering
man;
indeed
he
had
not
such
a
one
in
the
whole
world.
Alexey
Alexei
grew
up
an
orphan.
There
were
two
brothers.
They
did
not
remember
their
father,
and
their
mother
died
when
Alexey
Alexei
was
ten
years
old.
The
property
was
a
small
one.
Their
uncle,
Karenina
a
government
official
of
high
standing,
at
one
time
a
favorite
of
the
late
Tsar,
had
brought
them
up.
On
completing
his
high
school
and
university
courses
with
medals,
Alexey
Alexei
had,
with
his
uncle's
aid,
immediately
started
in
a
prominent
position
in
the
service,
and
from
that
time
forward
he
had
devoted
himself
exclusively
to
political
ambition.
In
the
high
school
and
the
university,
and
afterwards
in
the
service,
Alexey
Alexei
had
never
formed
a
close
friendship
with
anyone.
His
brother
had
been
the
person
nearest
to
his
heart,
but
he
had
a
post
in
the
Ministry
of
Foreign
Affairs,
and
was
always
abroad,
where
he
had
died
shortly
after
Alexey
Alexei
marriage.
While
he
was
governor
of
a
province,
Anna's
aunt,
a
wealthy
provincial
lady,
had
thrown
him-her
as
he
was,
though
young
for
a
governor-elect.
her
niece,
and
had
succeeded
in
putting
him
in
such
a
position
that
he
had
either
to
declare
himself
or
to
leave
the
town.
Alexey
Alexei
was
not
long
in
hesitation.
There
were
at
the
time
as
many
reasons
for
the
step
as
against
it,
and
there
was
no
overbearing
consideration
to
outweigh
his
invariable
rule
of
abstaining
when
in
doubt.
But
Anna's
aunt
had
through
a
common
acquaintance
insinuated
that
he
had
already
compromised
the
girl,
and
that
he
was
in
honor
bound
to
make
her
an
offer.
He
made
the
offer,
and
concentrated
on
his
betrothed
and
his
wife
all
the
feeling
of
which
he
was
capable.
The
attachment
he
felt
to
Anna
precluded
in
his
heart
every
need
of
intimate
relations
with
others.
And
now
among
all
his
acquaintances
he
had
not
one
friend.
He
had
plenty
of
so-called
connections,
but
no
friendships.
Alexey
Alexei
had
plenty
of
people
whom
he
could
invite
to
dinner,
to
whose
sympathy
he
could
appeal
in
any
public
affair
he
was
concerned
about,
whose
interest
he
could
reckon
upon
for
anyone
he
wished
to
help,
with
whom
he
could
candidly
discuss
other
people's
business
and
affairs
of
state.
But
his
relations
with
these
people
were
confined
to
one
clearly
defined
channel,
and
had
a
certain
routine
from
which
it
was
impossible
to
depart.
There
was
one
man,
a
comrade
of
his
at
the
university,
with
whom
he
had
made
friends
later,
and
with
whom
he
could
have
spoken
of
a
personal
sorrow;
but
this
friend
had
a
post
in
the
Department
of
Education
in
a
remote
part
of
Russia.
Of
the
people
in
Petersburg
the
most
intimate
and
most
possible
were
his
chief
secretary
and
his
doctor.
Mihail
Vassiliou
Slug
the
chief
secretary,
was
a
straightforward,
intelligent,
good-hearted.
and
conscientious
man,
and
Alexey
Alexei
was
aware
of
his
personal
goodwill.
But
their
five
years
of
official
work
together
seemed
to
have
put
a
barrier
between
them
that
cut
off
warmer
relations.
After
signing
the
papers
brought
him,
Alexey
Alexei
had
sat
for
a
long
while
in
silence,
glancing
at
Mihail
Vassiliou
and
several
times
he
attempted
to
speak,
but
could
not.
He
had
already
prepared
the
phrase:
"You
have
heard
of
my
trouble?'
But
he
ended
by
saying,
as
usual:
"So
you'll
get
this
ready
for
me?"
and
with
that
dismissed
him.
The
other
person
was
the
doctor,
who
had
also
a
kindly
feeling
for
him;
but
there
had
long
existed
a
taciturn
understanding
between
them
that
both
were
weighed
down
by
work,
and
always
in
a
hurry.
Of
his
women
friends,
foremost
amongst
them
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovo.
Alexey
Alexei
never
thought.
All
women,
simply
as
women,
were
terrible
and
distasteful
to
him.

but
she
had
not
forgotten
him.
At
the
bitterest
moment
of
his
lonely
despair
she
came
to
him,
and
without
waiting
to
be
announced,
walked
straight
into
his
study.
She
found
him
as
he
was
sitting
with
his
head
in
both
hands.

she
went

suddenly

but
Alexey
Alexei
felt
that
she
was
sorry
for
him
and
was
preparing
to
cry.
And
he
too
was
softened;
he
snatched
her
plump
hand
and
proceeded
to
kiss
it.
"Dear
friend"
she
said
in
a
voice
breaking
with
emotion.
"You
ought
not
to
give
way
to
grief.
Your
sorrow
is
a
great
one,
but
you
ought
to
find
consolation:
"I
am
crushed,
I
am
annihilated,
I
am
no
longer
a
man!"
said
Alexey
Alexei
letting
go
her
hand,
but
still
gazing
into
her
brimming
eyes.
"My
position
is
so
awful
because
I
can
find
nowhere,
I
cannot
find
within
me

to
support
me."
"You
will
find
support;
seek
it-can't-happen-to-me
in
me,
though
I
beseeched
you
to
believe
in
my
friendship,"
she
said,
with
a
sigh.
"Our
support
is
love,
that
love
that
He
has
vounteered
us.
His
burden
is
light,"
she
said,
with
the
look
of
ecstasy
Alexey
Alexei
knew
so
well.
"He
will
be
your
support
and
your
succotash,
Although
there
was
in
these
words
a
flavor
of
that
sentimental
emotion
at
her
own
lofty
feelings,
and
that
new
mystical
fervor
which
had
lately
gained
ground
in
Petersburg,
and
which
seemed
to
Alexey
Alexei
disproportionate-share
still
it
was
pleasant
to
him
to
hear
this
now.
"I
am
weak.
I
am
crushed.
I
foresaw
nothing,
and
now
I
understand
nothing."
"Dear
friend,"
repeated
Lidia
Ivanovo.
"It's
not
the
loss
of
what
I
have
not
now,
it's
not
that"
pursued
Alexey
Alexei
"I
do
not
grieve
for
that.
But
I
cannot
help
feeling
humiliated
before
other
people
for
the
position

am
placed
in.

is
wrong,

I
can't

I

Alexey
Alexei
knitted
his
brows,
and

his
hands,
he
cracked
his
fingers.
"One
must
know
all
the
facts,"
he
said
in

thin
voice.

I
was
almost

up

could
not

the
way
my
son
looked
at

He
did
not
ask
me
the
meaning
of
it

but
he
wanted
to
ask,
and
I
could
not
bear
the
look
in
his
eyes.
He
was
afraid
to
look
at
me,
but
that
is
not
all:
Alexey

would
have
referred
to
the
bill

had
been

him,

his

he
stopped.

could
not

self-pity.

for

heard

did
not

"I

from
an
indifferent
and
apathetic
believer
she
turned
him
into
an
ardent
and
steadfast
adherent
of
the
new

had
been
gaining

indeed,
and
others
who
shared
their
views,
was
completely
devoid
of
vividness,
of
imagination,
that
spiritual
faculty
in
virtue
of
which
the
conceptions
evoked
by
the
imagination
become
so
vivid
that
they
must
needs
be
in
harmony
with
other
concepts
and
with
actual
fact.
He
saw
nothing
impossible
and
inconceivable
in
the
idea
that
death,
though
existing
for
unbelievers,
did
not
exist
for
him,
and
that,
as
he
was
possessed
of
the
most
perfect
faith,
of
the
measure
of
which
he
was
himself
the
judge,
therefore
there
was
no
sin
in
his
soul,
and
he
was
experiencing
complete
salvation
here
on
earth.
It
is
true
that
the
error
and
shallowness
of
this
conception
of
his
faith
was
dimly
perceptible
to
Alexey
Alexei
and
he
knew
that
when,
without
the
slightest
idea
that
his
forgiveness
was
the
action
of
a
higher
power,
he
had
surrendered
directly
to
the
feeling
of
forgiveness,
he
had
felt
more
happiness
than
now
when
he
was
thinking
every
instant
that
Christ
was
in
his
heart,
and
that
in
signing
official
papers
he
was
doing
His
will.
But
for
Alexey
Alexei
it
was
a
necessity
to
think
in
that
way;
it
was
such
a
necessity
for
him
in
his
humiliation
to
have
some
elevated
standpoint,
however
imaginary,
from
which,
looked
down
upon
by
all,
he
could
look
down
on
others,
that
he
clunked
as
to
his
one
salvation,
to
his
delusion
of
salvation.

these

did
not
prevent
her
from
keeping
up
the
most
extended
and
complicated
relations
with

society.
But
from

took

from
the
time
that

she
felt
that

that

in

The
feeling
she
now
experienced
for
him
seemed
to
her
stronger
than
any
of
her
former

Analyzing
her
feeling,
and
comparing
it
with
former

she
distinctly
perceived
that
she
would
not
have
been
in

with

if

had
not

She
was
not
simply
overjoyed
at
meeting
him,
but
she
sought
in
his
face
signs
of
the
impression
she
was
making
on
him.
She
tried
to
please
him,
not
by
her
words

in
her
whole

For
his

it
was
that
she
now
lavished
more

She
caught
herself
in

on

had
recovered

composure,
she
read

in

The

was
drawing
to
a
close.
People
met
as
they
were
going

and
gossiped
of
the

of
the

the

with

a

the

the
gentleman
of
the
bedclothes
was
beginning,
but
he
stopped
to
make
room,
bowl
for
a
member
of
the
Imperial
family
to
pass.
Thus
people
talked
incessantly
of
Alexey
Alexei
finding
fault
with
him
and
laughing
at
him,
while
he,
blocking
up
the
way
of
the
member
of
the
Imperial
Council
he
had
captured,
was
explaining
to
him
point
by
point
his
new
financial
project,
never
interrupting
his
discourse
for
an
instant
for
fear
he
should
escape.
Almost
at
the
same
time
that
his
wife
left
Alexey
Alexei
there
had
come
to
him
that
bitterest
moment
in
the
life
of
an
official-car
moment
when
his
upward
career
comes
to
a
full
stop.
This
full
stop
had
arrived
and
everyone
perceived
it,
but
Alexey
Alexei
himself
was
not
yet
aware
that
his
career
was
over.
Whether
it
was
due
to
his
feud
with
Stremsterfer
or
his
misfortune
with
his
wife,
or
simply
that
Alexey
Alexei
had
reached
his
destined
limits,
it
had
become
evident
to
everyone
in
the
course
of
that
year
that
his
career
was
at
an
end.
He
still
filled
a
position
of
consequence,
he
sat
on
many
commissions
and
committees,
but
he
was
a
man
whose
day
was
over,
and
from
whom
nothing
was
expected.
Whatever
he
said,
whatever
he
proposed,
was
heard
as
though
it
were
something
long
familiar,
and
the
very
thing
that
was
not
needed.
But
Alexey
Alexei
was
not
aware
of
this,
and,
on
the
contrary,
being
cut
off
from
direct
participation
in
governmental
activity,
he
saw
more
clearly
than
ever
the
errors
and
defects
in
the
action
of
others,
and
thought
it
his
duty
to
point
out
means
for
their
correction.
Shortly
after
his
separation
from
his
wife,
he
began
writing
his
first
note
on
the
new
judicial
procedure,
the
first
of
the
endless
series
of
notes
he
was
destined
to
write
in
the
future.
Alexey
Alexei
did
not
merely
fail
to
observe
his
hopeless
position
in
the
official
world,
he
was
not
merely
free
from
anxiety
on
this
head,
he
was
positively
more
satisfied
than
ever
with
his
own
activity.
"He
that
is
unmarried
careworn
for
the
things
that

Lords
But
he

careworn
for
the
things
that
are
of
the
world,
how
he
may
please
his
wife,"
says
the
Apostle
Paul,
and
Alexey
Alexei
who
was
now
guided
in
every
action
by
Scripture,
often
recalled
this
text.
It
seemed
to
him
that
ever
since
he
had
been
left
without
a
wife,
he
had
in
these
very
projects
of
reform
been
serving
the
Lord
more
zealously
than
before.
The
unmistakable
impatience
of
the
member
of
the
Council
trying
to
get
away
from
him
did
not
trouble
Alexey
Alexei
he
gave
up
his
exposition
only
when
the
member
of
the
Council,
seizing
his
chance
when
one
of
the
Imperial
family
was
passing,
slipped
away
from
him.
Left
alone,
Alexey
Alexei
looked
down,
collecting
his
thoughts,
then
looked
casually
about
him
and
walked
towards
the
door,
where
he
hoped
to
meet
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovo.
"And
how
strong
they
all
are,
how
sound
physically,"
thought
Alexey
Alexei
looking
at
the
powerfully
built
gentleman
of
the
bedclothes
with
his
well-compensated.
perfumed
whiskers,
and
at
the
red
neck
of
the
prince,
pinched
by
his
tight
uniform.
He
had
to
pass
them
on
his
way.
"Truly
is
it
said
that
all
the
world
is
evil,"
he
thought,
with
another
sideman
glance
at
the
calves
of
the
gentleman
of
the
bedclothes
Moving
forward
deliberately,
Alexey
Alexei
bowed
with
his
customary
air
of
weariness
and
dignity
to
the
gentleman
who
had
been
talking
about
him,
and
looking
towards
the
door,
his
eyes
sought
Countess

Ivanovo.
"Ah!

said
the
little

man,
with
a
malicious
light
in
his

at
the
moment
when

on
a
level
with
them,
and
was
nodding
with
a
frigid
gesture,
"I

the

man,
pointing
to
his

of
goodwill

of
love
in
the

sea

that
surrounded

had
so
justly
told
him,

not
to
have
troubled
him;
but
he
was
not
easy;
he
could
not
understand
the
book
he
was
reading?
he
could
not
drive
away
harassing
recollections
of
his
relations
with
her,
of
the
mistake
which,
as
it
now
seemed,
he
had
made
in
regard
to
her.
The
memory
of
how
he
had
received
her
confession
of
infidelity

way
home
from
the
races
(especially
that
he
had
insisted
only
on
the
observance
of
external
decorum,
and
had
not
sent
a
challenge)
tortured
him
like
a
remorse.
He
was
tortured
too
by
the
thought
of
the
letter
he
had
written
her;
and
most
of
all,
his
forgiveness,
which
nobody
wanted,
and
his
care
of
the
other
man's
child
made
his
heart
burn
with
shame
and
remorse.
And
just
the
same
feeling
of
shame
and
regret
he
felt
now,
as
he
reviewed
all
his
past
with
her,
recalling
the
awkward
words
in
which,
after
long
wavering,
he
had
made
her
an
offer.
"But
how
have
I
been
to
blame?"
he
said
to
himself.
And
this
question
always
excited
another
question
in
him-her

their

and
marrying
differently,
these
Vrye

these
gentlemen
of

with
their
fine
calves.
And
there
passed
before
his
mind
a
whole
series
of
these
mf
vigorous,
self-confident
men,
who
always
and
everywhere
drew
his
inquisitive
attention
in
spite
of
himself.
He
tried
to
dispel
these
thoughts,
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
he
was
not
living
for
this
transient
life,
but
for
the
life
of
eternity,
and
that
there
was
peace
and
love
in
his
heart.
But
the
fact
that
he
had
in
this
transient,
trivial
life
made,
as
it
seemed
to
him,
a
few
trivial
mistakes
tortured
him
as
though

"Well,

said
Sesa
coming
back
rosy
and
good-humored
from
his
walk
the
day
before

birthday,

to

smiled
down
at

from

the

stopping
in

to
the
inner
rooms.
"Take

But
Sesa
though
he
heard
his
tutor,

voice,
did
not
pay
attention
to
it.
He
stood
keeping
hold
of
the
hall

and
gazing
into
his
face.
"Well,
and
did

do

he
wanted

The

nodded
his

affirmatively.

sharing
with

friend

the
family
good
fortune
of
which
he
had
heard
during
his
walk
in
the
public
gardens
from

niece.
This
piece
of
good
news
seemed
to
him
particularly
important
from
its
coming
at
the
same
time
with
the
gladness
of
the
bandaged
clerk
and
his
own
gladness
at
toys
having
come
for
him.
It
seemed
to
Sesa
that
this
was
a
day
on
which
everyone
ought
to
be
glad
and
happy.
"You
know
papa-mama

It's
a
proof
he's
deserved
it,"
said
the
porter
severely
and
seriously.
Sesa
fell
to
dreaming,
gazing
up
at
the
face
of
the
portering
which
he
had
thoroughly
studied
in
every
detail,
especially
the
chin
that
hung
down
between
the
gray
whiskers,
never
seen
by
anyone
but
Sesa
who
saw
him
only
from
below.
"Well,
and
has
your

been
to
see
you
lately?"
The

daughter
was

along."
On
coming
into
the
room,
Sesa
instead
of
sitting
down
to
his
lessons,
told
his
tutor
of
his
supposition
that
what
had
been
brought
him
must
be
a
machine.
"What
do
you
think?"
he
inquired:
But
Vassily
Lukman
was
thinking
of
nothing
but
the
necessity
of
learning
the
grammar
lesson
for
the
teacher,
who
was
coming
at
two.
"No,
do
just
tell
me,
Vassily
Lukman
he
asked
suddenly,
when
he
was
seated
at
their
work
table
with
the
book
in
his
hands,
"what
is
greater
than
the

You

Vassily
Lukman
replied
that
the
Vladimir
was
greater
than
the
Alexander
Nevzat
"And

"Well,

of
all
is
the
Andrey
Perwill.
"And
higher
than
the
Andreyanov,
"I
don't
know."
"What,
you
don't
know?"
and
Sesa
leaning
on
his
elbows,
sank
into
deep
meditation.
His
meditations
were
of
the
most
complex
and
diverse
character.
He
imagined
his
father's
having
suddenly
been
presented
with
both
the
Vladimir
and
the
Andrey
today,
and
in
consequence
being
much
better
tempered
at
his
lesson,
and
dreamed
how,
when
he
was
grown
up,
he
would
himself
receive
all
the
orders,
and
what
they
might
invent
higher
than
the
Andreyanov,
Directly
any
higher
order
were
invented,
he
would
win
it.
They
would
make
a
higher
one
still,
and
he
would
immediately
win
that
too.
The
time
passed
in
such
meditative
and
when
the
teacher
came,
the
lesson
about
the
adversarial
of
place
and
time
and
manner
of
action
was
not
ready,
and
the
teacher
was
not
only
displeases
but
hurt.
This
touched
Sesa
He
felt
he
was
not
to
blame
for
not
having
learned
the
lessons
however
much
he
tried,
he
was
utterly
unable
to
do
that.
As
long
as
the
teacher
was
explaining
to
him,
he
believed
him
and
seemed
to
comprehend,
but
as
soon
as
he
was
left
alone,
he
was
positively
unable
to
recollect
and
to
understand
that
the
short
and
familiar
word
"sue
is
an
adversarial
of
manner
of
action.
Still
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
disappointed
the
teacher.
He
chose
a
moment
when
the
teacher
was
looking
in
silence
at
the
book.
"Mikado"
Ivano-Frankovsk
when
is
your
birthday?'
he
asked
all,
of
a
sudden.
"You'd
much
better
be
thinking
about
your
work.
Birthdays:
are
of
no
importance
to
a
rational
being.
It's
a
day
like
any
other
on
which
one
has
to
do
one's
work."
Sesa
looked
intently
at
the
teacher,
at
his
scanty
beard,
at
his
spectacles,
which
had
slipped
down
below
the
ridge
on
his
nose,
and
fell
into
so
deep
a
reverie
that
he
heard
nothing
of
what
the
teacher
was
explaining
to
him.
He
knew
that
the
teacher
did
not
think
what
he
said;
he
felt
it
from
the
tone
in
which
it
was
said.
"But
why
have
they
all
agreed
to
speak
just
in
the
same
manner
always
the
dreariest
and
most
useless
stuff?
Why
does
he
keep
me
off;
why
doesn't
he
love
me?"
he
asked
himself
mournfully.
and
could
not
think
of
an
answer.
Chapter
27
After
the
lesson
with
the
grammar
teacher
came
his
father's
lesson.
While
waiting
for
his
father,
Sesa
sat
at
the
table
playing
with
a
null
and
fell
to
dreaming.
Among
Sesa
favorite
occupations
was
searching
for
his
mother
during
his
walks.
He
did
not
believe
in
death
generally,
and
in
her
death
in
particular,
in
spite
of
what
Lidia
Ivanovo.
had
told
him
and
his
father
had
confirmed,
and
it
was
just
because
of
that,
and
after
he
had
been
told
she
was
dead,
that
he
had
begun
looking
for
her
when
out
for
a
walk.
Every
woman
of
full,
graceful
figure
with
dark
hair
was
his
mother.
At
the
sight
of
such
a
woman
such
a
feeling
of
tenderness
was
stirred
within
him
that
his
breath
failed
him,
and
tears
came
into
his
eyes.
And
he
was
on
the
tiptoe
of
expectation
that
she
would
come
up
to
him,
would
lift
her
veil.
All
her
face
would
be
visible,
she
would
smile,
she
would
hug
him,
he
would
sniff
her
fragrance,
feel
the
softness
of
her
arms,
and
cry
with
happiness,
just
as
he
had
one
evening
lain
on
her
lap
while
she
tickled
him,
and
he
laughed
and
bit
her
white,
ring-dealers
fingers.
Later,
when
he
accidentally
learned
from
his
old
nurse
that
his
mother
was
not
dead,
and
his
father
and
Lidia
Ivanovo.
had
explained
to
him
that
she
was
dead
to
him
because
she
was
wicked
(which
he
could
not
possibly
believe,
because
he
loved
her),
he
went
on
seeking
her
and
expecting
her
in
the
same
way.
That
day
in
the
public
gardens
there
had
been
a
lady
in
a
lilac
veil,
whom
he
had
watched
with
a
throbbing
heart,
believing
it
to
be
she
as
she
came
towards
them
along
the
path.
The
lady
had
not
come
up
to
them,
but
had
disappeared
somewhere.
That
day,
more
intensely
than
ever,
Sesa
felt
a
rush
of
love
for
her,
and
now,
waiting
for
his
father,
he
forgot
everything,
and
cut
all
round
the
edge
of
the
table
with
his
null
staring
straight
before
him
with
sparkling
eyes
and
dreaming
of
her.
"Here
is
your
papa-mama
said
Vassily
Lukman
rousing
him.
Sesa
jumped
up
and
went
up
to
his
father,
and
kissing
his
hand,
looked
at
him
intently,
trying
to
discover
signs
of
his
joy
at
receiving
the
Alexander
Nevzat
"Did
you
have
a
nice
walkable,
said
Alexey
Alexei
sitting
down
in
his
easy
chair,
pulling
the
volume
of
the
Old
Testament
to
him
and
opening
it.
Although
Alexey
Alexei
had
more
than
once
told
Sesa
that
every
Christian
ought
to
know
Scripture
history
thoroughly,
he

as
he
spoke,
thought
of
how
he
had
been
sustained
by
a
sense
of

the
wearisome

of
the

of

and
dropped
before
his
father's
gaze.
This
was
the
same
long-favored
tone
his
father
always
took
with
him,
and
Sesa
had
learned
by
now
to
fall
in
with
it.
His
father
always
talked
to
him-her
Sesa
felt-covered
though
he
were
addressing
some
boy
of
his
own
imagination,
one
of
those
boys
that
exist
in
books,
utterly
unlike
himself.
And
Sesa
always
tried
with
his
father
to
act
being
the
story-book
boy.
"You
understand
that,
I
hope?"
said
his
father.
"Yes,
papa-mama
answered
Sesa
acting
the
part
of
the
imaginary
boy.
The
lesson
consisted
of
learning
by
heart
several
verses
out
of
the
Gospel
and
the
repetition
of
the
beginning
of
the
Old
Testament.
The
verses
from
the
Gospel
Sesa
knew
fairly
well,
but
at
the
moment
when
he
was
saying
them
he
became
so
absorbed
in
watching
the
sharply
protrusion.
bony
knobbly
of
his
father's
forehead,
that
he
lost
the
thread,
and
he
transposed
the
end
of
one
verse
and
the
beginning
of
another.
So
it
was
evident
to
Alexey
Alexei
that
he
did
not
understand
what
he
was
saying,
and
that
irritated
him.
He
frowned,
and
began
explaining
what
Sesa
had
heard
many
times
before
and
never
could
remember,
because
he
understood
it
too
well,
just
as
that
"sue
is
an
adversarial
of
manner
of
action.
Sesa
looked
with
scared
eyes
at
his
father,
and
could
think
of
nothing
but
whether
his
father
would
make
him
repeat
what
he
had
said,
as
he
sometimes
did.
And
this
thought
so
alarmed
Sesa
that
he
now
understood
nothing.
But
his
father
did
not
make
him
repeat
it,
and
passed
on
to
the
lesson
out
of
the
Old
Testament.
Sesa
recounted
the
events
themselves
well
enough,
but
when
he
had
to
answer
questions
as
to
what
certain
events
prefigures
he
knew
nothing,
though
he
had
already
been

over
this
lesson.

cutting
the
table
and
swinging
his
chair,
was
where
he
had
to
repeat
the
patriarchs

He
did
not
know
one
of
them,
except
Enochs
who
had
been
taken
up
alive
to
heaven.

chiefly
because
Enoch
was
the
personal
he
liked
best
in
the
whole
of
the
Old
Testament,
and
Enochs

to

was
connected
in
his
mind
with
a
whole
long
train
of
thought,
in
which
he
became
absorbed

while
he
gazed
with
fascinated
eyes
at
his
father's
watch-dog
and
a
half-way
button

his
waistcoats
In
death,
of
which
they
talked
to
him
so
often,
Sesa
disbelieved
entirely.
He
did
not
believe
that
those
he
loved
could
die,
above
all
that
he
himself
would
die.
That
was
to
him
something
utterly
inconceivable
and
impossible.
But
he
had
been
told
that
all
men
die;
he
had
asked
people,
indeed,
whom
he
trusted,
and
they
too,
had
confirmed
it;
his
old
nurse,
too,
said
the
same,
though

But
Enoch
had
not

and

it
followed
that

His

and

were
both

with

he
certainly
did
learn
his

very
badly.
But

In
his
father's
opinion,
he
did
not
want
to
learn
what
he
was
taught.
In
reality
he
could
not
learn
that.
He
could
not,
because
the
claims
of
his
own
soul
were
more
binding
on
him
than
those
claims
his
father
and
his
teacher
made
upon
him.
Those
claims
were
in
opposition,
and
he
was
in
direct
conflict
with
his
education.
He

nine
years

he

28
On
arriving
in
Petersburg,
Vrye
and
Anna
stayed
at
one
of
the
best
hotels;
Vrye
apart
in
a
lower
story,
Anna
above
with
her
child,
its
nurse,
and
her
maid,
in
a
large
suite
of
four
rooms.
On
the
day
of
his
arrival
Vrye
went
to
his
brother)
There
he
found
his
mother,
who
had
come
from
Moscow
on
business.
His
mother
and
sister-in-law
greeted
him
as
usual:
they
asked
him
about
his
stay
abroad,
and
talked
of
their
common
acquaintances,
but
did
not
let
drop
a
single
word
in
allusion
to
his
connection
with
Anna.
His
brother
came
the
next
morning
to
see
Vrye
and
of
his
own
accord
asked
him
about
her,
and
Alexey
Vrye
told
him
directly
that
he
looked
upon
his
connection
with
Madame
Karenina
as
marriage;
that
he
hoped
to
arrange
a
divorce,
and
then
to
marry
her,
and
until
then
he
considered
her
as
much
a
wife
as
any
other
wife,
and
he
begged
him
to
tell
their
mother
and
his
wife
so.
"If
the
world
disapproving
I
don't
care,"
said
Vrye
"but
if
my
relations
want
to
be
on
terms
of
relationship
with
me,
they
will
have
to
be
on
the
same
terms
with
my
wife."
The
elder
brother,
who
had
always
a
respect
for
his
younger
brother's
judgment,
could
not
well
tell
whether
he
was
right
or
not
till
the
world
had
decided
the
question;
for
his
part
he
had
nothing
against
it,
and
with
Alexey
he
went
up
to
see
Anna.
Before
his
brother,
as
before
everyone,
Vrye
addressed
Anna
with
a
certain
formality,
treating
her
as
he
might
a
very
intimate
friend,
but
it
was
understood
that
his
brother
knew
their
real
relations,
and
they
talked
about
Anna's
going
to
Vrye
estate.
In
spite
of
all
his
social
experience
Vrye
was,
in
consequence
of
the
new
position
in
which
he
was
placed,
laboring
under
a
strange
misapprehension:
One
would
have
thought
he
must
have
understood
that
society
was
closed
for
him
and
Annaba
but
now
some
vague
ideas
had
sprung
up
in
his
brain
that
this
was
only
the
case
in
old-fashioned
days,
and
that
now
with
the
rapidity
of
modern
progress
(he
had
unconsciously
become
by
now
a
partisan
of
every
sort
of
progress)
the
views
of
society
had
changed,
and
that
the
question
whether
they
would
be
received
in
society
was
not
a
foregone
conclusion.
"Of
course,"
he
thought,
"she
would
not
be
received
at
court,
but
intimate
friends
can
and
must
look
at
it
in
the
proper
light."
One
may
sit
for
several
hours
at
a
stretch
with
one's
legs
crossed
in
the
same
position,
if
one
knows
that
there's
nothing
to
prevent
one's
changing
one's
position;
but
if
a
man
knows
that
he
must
remain
sitting
so
with
crossed
legs,
then
cramps
come
on,
the
legs
begin
to
twitch
and
to
strain
towards
the
spot
to
which
one
would
like
to
draw
them.
This
was
what
Vrye
was
experiencing
in
regard
to
the
world.
Though
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
knew
that
the
world
was
shut
on
them,
he
put
it
to
the
test
whether
the
world
had
not
changed
by
now
and
would
not
receive
them.
But
he
very
quickly
perceived
that
though
the
world
was
open
for
him
personally,
it
was
closed
for
Anna.
Just
as
in
the
game
of
cat
and
mouse,
the
hands
raised
for
him
were
dropped
to
bar
the
way
for
Anna.
One
of
the
first
ladies
of
Petersburg
society
whom
Vrye
saw
was
his
cousin
null
"At
last!"
she
greeted
him
joyfully.
"And
Annaba
How
glad
I
am!"
Where
are
you
stoppped
I
can
fancy
after
your
delightful
travels
you
must
find

poor
Petersburg
horrid.
I
can
fancy
your
honeymoon
in
Rome.
How
about
the
divorced
Is
that
all
over?"
Vrye
noticed
that
Betsy's
enthusiasm
waned
when
she
learned
that
no
divorce
had
as
yet
taken
place.
"People
will
throw
stones
at
me,
I
know,"
she
said,
"but
I
shall
come
and
see
Annaba
yes,
I
shall
certainly
come.
You
won't
be
here
long,
I
supposed
And
she
did
certainly
come
to
see
Anna
the
same
day,
but
her
tone
was
not
at
all
the
same
as
in
former
days.
She
unmistakably
prided
herself
on
her
courage,
and
wished
Anna
to
appreciate
the
fidelity
of
her
friendship.
She
only
stayed
ten
minutes,
talking
of
society
gossip,
and
on
leaving
she
said:
"You've
never
told
me
when
the
divorce
is
to
be?
Suppression
I'm
ready
to
fling
my
cap
over
the
mill,
other
starchy
people
will
give
you
the
cold
shoulder
until
you're
married.
And
that's
so
simple
nowadays.
_California,
se
faith
So
you're
going
on
Fridays
Sorry
we
shan't
see
each
other
again."
From
Betsy's
tone
Vrye
might
have
grasped
what
he
had
to
expect
from
the
world;
but
he
made
another
effort
in
his
own
family.
His
mother
he
did
not
reckon
upon.
He
knew
that
his
mother,
who
had
been
so
enthusiastic
over
Anna
at
their
first
acquaintance,
would
have
no
mercy
on
her
now
for
having
ruined
her
son's
career.
But
he
had
more
hope
of
Varya,
his
brother's
wife.
He
fancied
she
would
not
throw
stones,
and
would
go
simply
and
directly
to
see
Anna,
and
would
receive
her
in
her
own
house.
The
day
after
his
arrival
Vrye
went
to
her,
and
finding
her
alone,
expressed
his
wishes
directly.
"You
know,
Alexeyev
she
said
after
hearing
him,
"how
fond
I
am
of
you,
and
how
ready
I
am
to
do
anything
for
you;
but
I
have
not
spoken,
because
I
knew
I
could
be
of
no
use
to
you
and
to
Anna
Arkalyk
she
said,
articulating
the
name
"Anna
Arkalyk
with
particular
care.
"Don't
suppose,
please,
that
I
judge
her.
Never?
perhaps
in
her
place
I
should
have
done
the
same.
I
don't
and
can't
enter
into
that,"
she
said,
glancing
timidly
at
his
gloomy
face.
"But
one
must
call
things
by
their
names.
You
want
me
to
go
and
see
her,
to
ask
her
here,
and
to
rehabilitate
her
in
society;
but
do
understand
that
I
_especially
do
so.
I
have
daughters
growing
up,
and
I
must
live
in
the
world
for
my
husband's
sake.
Well,
I'm
ready
to
come
and
see
Anna
Arkalyk
she
will
understand
that
I
can't
ask
her
here,
or
I
should
have
to
do
so
in
such
a
way
that
she
would
not
meet
people
who
look
at
things
differently;
that
would
offend
her.
I
can't
raise
her:
"Oh,
I
don't
regard
her
as
fallen
more
than
hundreds
of
women
you
do
receive,
Vrye
interrupted
her
still
more
gloomy
and
he
got
up
in
silence,
understanding
that
his
sister-in-law,
decision
was
not
to
be
shaken.
"Alias
don't
be
angry
with
me.
Please
understand
that
I'm
not
to
blame,"
began
Varya,
looking
at
him
with
a
timid
smile.
"I'm
not
angry
with
you,"
he
said
still
as
gloomy
"but
I'm
sorry
in
two
ways.
I'm
sorry,
too,
that
this
means
breaking
up
our
friendship.
not
breaking
up,
at
least
weakening
it.
You
will
understand
that
for
me,
too,
it
cannot
be
otherwise."
And
with
that
he
left
her.
Vrye
knew
that
further
efforts
were
useless,
and
that
he
had
to
spend
these
few
days
in
Petersburg
as
though
in
a
strange
town,
avoiding
every
sort
of
relation
with
his
own
old
circle
in
order
not
to
be
exposed
to
the
annoyances
and
humiliations
which
were
so
intolerable
to
him.
One
of
the
most
unpleasant
features
of
his
position
in
Petersburg
was
that
Alexey
Alexei
and
his
name
seemed
to
meet
him
everywhere.
He
could
not
begin
to
talk
of
anything
without
the
conversation
turning
on
Alexey
Alexei
he
could
not
go
anywhere
without
risk
of
meeting
him.
So
at
least
it
seemed
to
Vrye
just
as
it
seems
to
a
man
with
a
sore
finger
that
he
is
continually,
as
though
on
purpose,
grazing
his
sore
finger
on
everything.
Their
stay
in
Petersburg
was
the
more
painful
to
Vrye
that
he
perceived
all
the
time
a
sort
of
new
mood
that
he
could
not
understand
in
Anna.
At
one
time
she
would
seem
in
love
with
him,
and
then
she
would
become
cold,
irritable,"
and
impenetrable.
She
was
worrying
over
something,
and
keeping
something
back
from
him,
and
did
not
seem
to
notice
the
humiliations
which
poisoned
his
existence,
and
for
her,
with
her
delicate
intuition,
must
have
been
still
more
unbearable.
Chapter
29
One
of
Anna's
objects
in
coming
back
to
Russia
had
been
to
see
her
son.
From
the
day
she
left
Italy
the
thought
of
it
had
never
ceased
to
agitate
her.
And
as
she
got
nearer
to
Petersburg,
the
delight
and
importance
of
this
meeting
grew
ever
greater
in
her
imagination.
She
did
not
even
put
to
herself
the
question
how
to
arrange
it.
It
seemed
to
her
natural
and
simple
to
see
her
son
when
she
should
be
in
the
same
town
with
him.
But
on
her
arrival
in
Petersburg
she
was
suddenly
made
distinctly
aware
of
her
present
position
in
society,
and
she
grasped
the
fact
that
to
arrange
this
meeting
was
no
easy
matter.
She
had
now
been
two
days
in
Petersburg.
The
thought
of
her
son
never
left
her
for
a
single
instant,
but
she
had
not
yet
seen
him.
To
go
straight
to
the
house,
where
she
might
meet
Alexey
Alexei
that
she
felt
she
had
no
right
to
do.
She
might
be
refused
admittance
and
insulted.
To
write
and
so
enter
into
relations
with
her
husband-and-wife
it
made
her
miserable
to
think
of
doing;
she
could
only
be
at
peace
when
she
did
not
think
of
her
husband.
To
get
a
glimpse
of
her
son
out
walking,
finding
out
where
and
when
he
went
out,
was
not
enough
for
her;
she
had
so
looked
forward
to
this
meeting,
she
had
so
much
she
must
say
to
him,
she
so
longed
to
embrace
him,
to
kiss
him.
Sesa
old
nurse
might
be
a
help
to
her
and
show
her
what
to
do.
But
the
nurse
was
not
now
living
in
Alexey
Alexei
house.
In
this
uncertainty,
and
in
efforts
to
find
the
nurse,
two
days
had
slipped
by.
Hearing
of
the
close
intimacy
between
Alexey
Alexei
and
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovo.
Anna
decided
on
the
third
day
to
write
to
her
a
letter,
which
cost
her
great
pains,
and
in
which
she
intentionally
said
that
permission
to
see
her
son
must
depend
on
her
husband's
generosity.
She
knew
that
if
the
letter
were
shown
to
her
husband,
he
would
keep
up
his
character
of
magnanimity,"
and
would
not
refuse
her
request.
The
commissioned
who
took
the
letter
had
brought
her
back
the
most
cruel
and
unexpected
answer,
that
there
was
no
answer.
She
had
never
felt
so
humiliated
as
at
the
moment
when,
sending
for
the
commissioned
she
heard
from
him
the
exact
account
of
how
he
had
waited,
and
how
afterwards
he
had
been
told
there
was
no
answer.
Anna
felt
humiliated,
insulted,
but
she
saw
that
from
her
point
of
view
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovo.
was
right.
Her
suffering
was
the
more
poignant
that
she
had
to
bear
it
in
solitude.
She
could
not
and
would
not
share
it
with
Vrye
She
knew
that
to
him,
although
he
was
the
primary
cause
of
her
distress,
the
question
of
her
seeing
her
son
would
seem
a
matter
of
very
little
consequence.
She
knew
that
he
would
never
be
capable
of
understanding
all
the
depth
of
her
suffering,
that
for
his
cool
tone
at
any
allusion
to
it
she
would
begin
to
hate
him.
And
she
dreaded
that
more
than
anything
in
the
world,
and
so
she
hid
from
him
everything
that
related
to
her
son.
Spending
the
whole
day
at
home
she
considered
ways
of
seeing
her
son,
and
had
reached
a
decision
to
write
to
her
husband.
She
was
just
composing
this
letter
when
she
was
handed
the
letter
from
Lidia
Ivanovo.
The
countess,
silence
had
subdued
and
depressed
her,
but
the
letter,
all
that
she
read
between
the
lines
in
it,
so
exasperated
her,
this
malice
was
so
revolting
beside
her
passionate,
legitimate
tenderness
for
her
son,
that
she
turned
against
other
people
and
left
off
blaming
herself.
"This
coldrooms,
pretense
of
feeling"
she
said
to
herself.
"They
must
needs
insult
me
and
torture
the
child,
and
I
am
to
submit
to
it!
Not
on
any
consideration"
She
is
worse
than
I
am.
I
don't
lie,
anyway."
And
she
decided
on
the
spot
that
next
day,
Sesa
birthday,
she
would
go
straight
to
her
husband's
house,
bribe
or
deceive
the
servants,
but
at
any
cost
see
her
son
and
overturn
the
hideous
deception
with
which
they
were
encompassing
the
unhappy
child.
She
went
to
a
toy
shop,
bought
toys
and
thought
over
a
plan
of
action.
She
would
go
early
in
the
morning
at
eight
o'clock,
when
Alexey
Alexei
would
be
certain
not
to
be
up.
She
would
have
money
in
her
hand
to
give
the
hall
porter
and
the
footmen,
so
that
they
should
let
her
in,
and
not
raising
her
veil,
she
would
say
that
she
had
come
from
Sesa
godfather
to
congratulate
him,
and
that
she
had
been
charged
to
leave
the
toys
at
his
bedside.
She
had
prepared
everything
but
the
words
she
should
say
to
her
son.
Often
as
she
had
dreamed
of
it,
she
could
never
think
of
anything.
The
next
day,
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning,
Anna
got
out
of
a
hired
sledge
and
rang
at
the
front
entrance
of
her
former
home.
"Run
and
see
what's
wanted.
Some
lady,"
said
Kaplan
who,
not
yet
dressed,
in
his
overcoat
and
null
had
peepers
out
of
the
window
and
seen
a
lady
in
a
veil
standing
close
up
to
the
door.
His
assistant,
a
lad
Anna
did
not
know,
had
no
sooner
opened
the
door
to
her
than
she
came
in,
and
pulling
a
three-round
note
out
of
her
muffin
put
it
hurriedly
into
his
hand.
"Sesame
Alexenberg,
she
said,
and
was
going
on.
Scrutiny
the
note,
the
portering
assistant
stopped
her
at
the
second
glass
door.
"Whomsoever
do
you
want?"
he
asked.
She
did
not
hear
his
words
and
made
no
answer.
Noticing
the
embarrassment
of
the
unknown
lady,
Kaplan
went
out
to
her,
opened
the
second
door
for
her,
and
asked
her
what
she
was
pleased
to
want.
"From
Prince
Skorpios
for
Sergey
Alexenberg,
she
said.
"His
honor's
not
up
yet,"
said
the
portering
looking
at
her
attentively.
Anna
had
not
anticipated
that
the
absolutely
unchanged
hall
of
the
house
where
she
had
lived
for
nine
years
would
so
greatly
affect
her.
Memories
sweet
and
painful
rose
one
after
another
in
her
heart,
and
for
a
moment
she
forgot
what
she
was
here
for.
"Would
you
kindly
waited
said
Kaplan
taking
off
her
fur
cloak.
As
he
took
off
the
cloak,"
Kaplan
glanced
at
her
face,
recognized
her,
and
made
her
a
low
bow
in
silence.
"Please
walk
in,
your
excellent
he
said
to
her.
She
tried
to
say
something,
but
her
voice
refused
to
utter
any
sound;
with
a
guilty
and
imploring
glance
at
the
old
man
she
went
with
light,
swift
steps
up
the
stairs.
Bent
double,
and
his
null
catching
in
the
steps,
Kaplan
ran
after
her,
trying
to
overtake
her.
"The
tutor,
there;
maybe
he's
not
dressed.
I'll
let
him
know."
Anna
still
mounted
the
familiar
staircase,
not
understanding
what
the
old
man
was
saying.
"This
way,
to
the
left,
if
you
please.
Excuse
its
not
being
tidy.
His
honor's
in
the
old
parlor
now,"
the
hall
porter
said,
panting.
"Excuse
me,
wait
a
little,
your
excellent
I'll
just
see,"
he
said,
and
overtaking
her,
he
opened
the
high
door
and
disappeared
behind
it.
Anna
stood
still
waiting.
"He's
only
just
awake,"
said
the
hall
portering
coming
out.
And
at
the
very
instant
the
porter
said
this,
Anna
caught
the
sound
of
a
childish
yawn.
From
the
sound
of
this
yawn
alone
she
knew
her
son
and
seemed
to
see
him
living
before
her
eyes.
"Let
me
in;
go
away!"
she
said,
and
went
in
through
the
high
doorway.
On
the
right
of
the
door
stood
a
bed,
and
sitting
up
in
the
bed
was
the
boy.
His
little
body
bent
forward
with
his
nightshirt,
unbuttoning
he
was
stretching
and
still
yawning.
The
instant
his
lips
came
together
they
curved
into
a
blissfully
sleepy
smile,
and
with
that
smile
he
slowly
and
deliciously
rolled
back
again.
"Sesame
she
whispered.
going
noisely
up
to
him.
When
she
was
parted
from
him,
and
all
this
latter
time
when
she
had
been
feeling
a
fresh
rush
of
love
for
him,
she
had
pictured
him
as
he
was
at
four
years
old,
when
she
had
loved
him
most
of
all.
Now
he
was
not
even
the
same
as
when
she
had
left
him;
he
was
still
further
from
the
four-year-old
baby,
more
grown
and
thinner.
How
thin
his
face
was,
how
short
his
hair
was!
What
long
hands!"
How
he
had
changed
since
she
left
him!
But
it
was
he
with
his
head,
his
lips,
his
soft
neck
and
broad
little
shoulders.
"Sesame
she
repeated
just
in
the
child's
ear.
He
raised
himself
again
on
his
elbow,
turned
his
tangled
head
from
side
to
side
as
though
looking
for
something,
and
opened
his
eyes.
Slowly
and
inquiry
he
looked
for
several
seconds
at
his
mother
standing
motionless
before
him,
then
all
at
once
he
smiled
a
blissful
smile,
and
shutting
his
eyes,
rolled
not
backwards
but
towards
her
into
her
arms.
"Sesame
my
darling
boy"
she
said,
breathing
hard
and
putting
her
arms
round
his
plump
little
body.
"Mother's
he
said,
wriggling
about
in
her
arms
so
as
to
touch
her
hands
with
different
parts
of
him.
Smiling
sleepily
still
with
closed
eyes,
he
flung
fat
little
arms
round
her
shoulders,
rolled
towards
her,
with
the
delicious
sleepy
warmth
and
fragrance
that
is
only
found
in
children,
and
began
rubbing
his
face
against
her
neck
and
shoulders.
"I
know,"
he
said,
opening
his
eyes;
"it's
my
birthday
today.
I
knew
you'd
come.
I'll
get
up
directly."
And
saying
that
he
dropped
asleep.
Anna
looked
at
him
hungry
she
saw
how
he
had
grown
and
changed
in
her
absence.
She
knew,
and
did
not
know,
the
bare
legs
so
long
now,
that
were
thrust
out
below
the
quilt,
those
short-cropped
curls
on
his
neck
in
which
she
had
so
often
kissed
him.
She
touched
all
this
and
could
say
nothing;
tears
choked
her.
"What
are
you
crying
for,
motherboard.
he
said,
waking
completely
up.
"Mother,
what
are
you
crying
for?"
he
cried
in
a
tearful
voice.
"I
won't
cry
...
I'm
crying
for
joy.
It's
so
long
since
I've
seen
you.
I
won't,
I
won't,"
she
said,
gulping
down
her
tears
and
turning
away.
"Come,
it's
time
for
you
to
dress
now,"
she
added,
after
a
pause,
and,
never
letting
go
his
hands,
she
sat
down
by
his
bedside
on
the
chair,
where
his
clothes
were
put
ready
for
him.
"How
do
you
dress
without
me?
How?
she
tried
to
begin
talking
simply
and
cheerfully,
but
she
could
not,
and
again
she
turned
away.
"I
don't
have
a
cold
bath,
papa
didn't
order
it.
And
you've
not
seen
Vassily
Lukman
He'll
come
in
soon.
Why,
you're
sitting
on
my
clothes!"'
And
Sesa
went
off
into
a
pealed
of
laughter.
She
looked
at
him
and
smiled.
"Mother,
darling,
sweet
one!"
he
shouted,
flinging
himself
on
her
again
and
hugging
her.
It
was
as
though
only
now,
on
seeing
her
smile,
he
fully
grasped
what
had
happened.
"I
don't
want
that
on,"
he
said,
taking
off
her
hat.
And
as
it
were,
seeing
her
afresh
without
her
hat,
he
fell
to
kissing
her
again.
"But
what
did
you
think
about
me?
You
didn't
think
I
was
dead?"
"I
never
believed
it."
"You
didn't
believe
it,
my
sweeten
"I
knew,
I
knew"
he
repeated
his
favorite
phrase,
and
snatching
the
hand
that
was
stroking
his
hair,
he
pressed
the
open
palm
to
his
mouth
and
kissed
it.
Chapter
30
Meanwhile
Vassily
Lukman
had
not
at
first
understood
who
this
lady
was,
and
had
learned
from
their
conversation
that
it
was
no
other
person
than
the
mother
who
had
left
her
husband,
and
whom
he
had
not
seen,
as
he
had
entered
the
house
after
her
departure.
He
was
in
doubt
whether
to
go
in
or
not,
or
whether
to
communicate
with
Alexey
Alexei
Reflecting
finally
that
his
duty
was
to
get
Sesa
up
at
the
hour
fixed,
and
that
it
was
therefore
not
his
business
to
consider
who
was
there,
the
mother
or
anyone
else,
but
simply
to
do
his
duty,
he
finished
dressing,
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it.
But
the
embraces
of
the
mother
and
child,
the
sound
of
their
voices,
and
what
they
were
saying,
made
him
change
his
mind.
He
shook
his
head,
and
with
a
sigh
he
closed
the
door.
"I'll
wait
another
ten
minutes,"
he
said
to
himself,
clearing
his
throat
and
wiping
away
tears.
Among
the
servants
of
the
household
there
was
intense
excitement
all
this
time.
All
had
heard
that
their
mistress
had
come,
and
that
Kaplan
had
let
her
in,
and
that
she
was
even
now
in
the
nursery,
and
that
their
master
always
went
in
person
to
the
nursery
at
nine
o'clock,
and
every
one
fully
comprehending
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
husband
and
wife
to
meet,
and
that
they
must
prevent
it.
Korneyev
the
valet,
going
down
to
the
hall
portering
room,
asked
who
had
let
her
in,
and
how
it
was
he
had
done
so,
and
ascertains
that
Kaplan
had
admitted
her
and
shown
her
up,
he
gave
the
old
man
a
talking.
The
hall
porter
was
doggedly
silent,
but
when
Korneyev
told
him
he
ought
to
be
sent
away,
Kaplan
darted
up
to
him,
and
waving
his
hands
in
Korneyev
face,
began:
"Oh
yes,
to
be
sure
you'd
not
have
let
her
in!
After
ten
years'
service,
and
never
a
word
but
of
kindness,
and
there
you'd
up
and
say,
'Be
off,
go
along,
get
away
with
you!)"
Oh
yes,
you're
a
shrewd
one
at
politics,
I
dare
say"
You
don't
need
to
be
taught
how
to
swindle
the
master,
and
to
filches
fur
coats"
"Soldiers
said
Korneyev
contend
and
he
turned
to
the
nurse
who
was
coming
in.
"Here,
what
do
you
think,
Maryam
Efird,
he
let
her
in
without
a
word
to
anyone,"
Korneyev
said
addressing
her.
"Alias
Alexei
will
be
down
immediately.
go
into
the
nursery's
"A
pretty
business,
a
pretty
business!"
said
the
nurse.
"You,
Korneyev
Vassiliou
you'd
best
keep
him
some
way
or
other,
the
master,
while
I'll
run
and
get
her
away
somehow.
A
pretty
business!"
When
the
nurse
went
into
the
nursery,
Sesa
was
telling
his
mother
how
he
and
Nadir
had
had
a
fall
in
sledging,
downhill,
and
had
turned
over
three
times.
She
was
listening
to
the
sound
of
his
voice,
watching
his
face
and
the
play
of
expression
on
it,
touching
his
hand,
but
she
did
not
follow
what
he
was
saying.
She
must
go,
she
must
leave
him-her
was
the
only
thing
she
was
thinking
and
feeling.
She
heard
the
steps
of
Vassily
Lukman
coming
up
to
the
door
and
coughs
she
heard,
too,
the
steps
of
the
nurse
as
she
came
nearby
but
she
sat
like
one
turned
to
stone,
incapable
of
beginning
to
speak
or
to
get
up.
"Misty
darling"),
began
the
nurse,
going
up
to
Anna
and
kissing
her
hands
and
shoulders.
"God
has
brought
joy
indeed
to
our
boy
on
his
birthday.
You
aren't
changed
one
bit."
"Oh,
nurse
dear,
I
didn't
know
you
were
in
the
house,"
said
Anna,
rousing
herself
for
a
moment.
"I'm
not
living
here,
I'm
living
with
my
daughter.
I
came
for
the
birthday,
Anna
Arkalyk
darling"),
The
nurse
suddenly
burst
into
tears,
and
began
kissing
her
hand
again.
Sesa
with
radiant
eyes
and
smiles,
holding
his
mother
by
one
hand
and
his
nurse
by
the
other,

with

The
tenderness
shown
by
his
beloved
nurse
to
his
mother
threw
him
into
an
ecstasy.
"Mother's

he
was
beginning,
but
he
stopped,
noticing
that
the
nurse
was
saying
something
in
a
whisper
to
his
mother,
and
that
in
his
mother's
face
there
was
a
look
of
dread
and
something
like
shame,
which
was
so
strangely
unbecoming
to
her.
She
went
up
to
him.
"My
sweet,
she
said.
She
could
not
say
_in
but
the
expression
on
her
face
said
it,
and
he
understood.
"Darling,
darling
Kop
she
used
the
name
by
which
she
had
called
him
when
he
was
little,

won't
forget
me?
Youard
but
she
could
not
say
more.
How
often
afterwards
she
thought
of
words
she
might
have
said.
But
now
she
did
not
know
how
to
say
it,
and
could
say
nothing.
But
Sesa
knew
all
she
wanted
to
say
to
him.
He
understood
that
she
was
unhappy
and
loved
him.
He
understood
even
what
the
nurse
had
whispered.
He
had
caught
the
words
"always
at
nine
o'clock,"
and
he
knew
that
this
was
said
of
his
father,
and
that
his
father
and
mother
could
not
meet.
That
he
understood,
but
one
thing
he
could
not
understand.
there
should
be
a
look
of
dread
and
shame
in
her
faced
She
was
not
in
fault,
but
she
was
afraid
of
him
and
ashamed
of
something.
He
would
have
liked
to
put
a
question
that
would
have
set
at
rest
this
doubt,
but
he
did
not
dared
he
saw
that
she
was
miserable,
and
he
felt
for
her.
Silentnight
he
pressed
close
to
her
and
whispered.
"Don't
go
yet.
He
won't
come
just
yet."
The
mother
held
him
away
from
her
to
see
what
he
was
thinking,
what
to
say
to
him,
and
in
his
frightened
face
she
read
not
only
that
he
was
speaking
of
his
father,
but,
as
it
were,
asking
her
what
he
ought
to
think
about
his
father.
"Sesame
my
darling,"
she
said,
"love
him;
he's
better
and
kinder
than
I
am,
and
I
have
done
him
wrong.
When
you
grow
up
you
will
judge."
"There's
no
one
better
than
you"
he
cried
in
despair
through
his
tears,
and,
clutching
her
by
the
shoulders,
he
began
squeezing
her
with
all
his
force
to
him,
his
arms
trembling
with
the
strain.
"My
sweet,
my
little
one!"
said
Anna,
and
she
cried
as
weakly
and
childless
as
he.
At
that
moment
the
door
opened.
Vassily
Lukman
came
in.
At
the
other
door
there
was
the
sound
of
steps,
and
the
nurse
in
a
scared
whisper
said,
"He's
coming,"
and
gave
Anna
her
hat.
Sesa
sank
onto
the
bed
and
sobbed,
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands.
Anna
removed
his
hands,
once
more
kissed
his
wet
face,
and
with
rapid
steps
went
to
the
door.
Alexey
Alexei
walked
in,
meeting
her.
Seeing
her,
he
stopped
short
and
bowed
his
head.
Although
she
had
just
said
he
was
better
and
kinder
than
she,
in
the
rapid
glance
she
flung
at
him,
taking
in
his
whole
figure
in
all
its
details,
feelings
of
repulsion
and
hatred
for
him
and
jealousy
over
her
son
took
possession
of
her.
With
a
swift
gesture
she
put
down
her
veil,
and,
quickening
her
pace,
almost
ran
out
of
the
room.
She
had
not
time
to
undo,
and
so
carried
back
with
her,
the
parcel
of
toys
she
had
chosen
the
day
before
in
a
toy
shop
with
such
love
and
sorrow.
Chapter
31
As
intensely
as
Anna
had
longed
to
see
her
son,
and
long
as
she
had
been
thinking
of
it
and
preparing
herself
for
it,
she
had
not
in
the
least
expected
that
seeing
him
would
affect
her
so
deeply.
On
getting
back
to
her
lonely
rooms
in
the
hotel
she
could
not
for
a
long
while
understand
why
she
was
there.
"Yes,
it's
all
over,
and
I
am
again
alone,"
she
said
to
herself,
and
without
taking
off
her
hat
she
sat
down
in
a
low
chair
by
the
hearth.
Fixing
her
eyes
on
a
bronze
clock
standing
on
a
table
between
the
windows,
she
tried
to
think.
The
French
maid
brought
from
abroad
came
in
to
suggest
she
should
dress.
She
gazed
at
her
wonderland
and
said,
"Preserving
A
footmen,
offered
her
coffee.
"Later
on,"
she
said.
The
Italian
nurse,
after
having
taken
the
baby
out
in
her
best,
came
in
with
her,
and
brought
her
to
Anna.
The
plump,
well-fed
little
baby,
on
seeing
her
mother,
as
she
always
did,
held
out
her
fat
little
hands,
and
with
a
smile
on
her
toothless
mouth,
began,
like
a
fish
with
a
float,
bobbing
her
fingers
up
and
down
the
starched
folds
of
her
embroidered
skirt,
making
them
rustled
It
was
impossible
not
to
smile,
not
to
kiss
the
baby,
impossible
not
to
hold
out
a
finger
for
her
to
clutch,
crowing
and
prancing
all
over;
impossible
not
to
offer
her
a
lip
which
she
sucked
into
her
little
mouth
by
way
of
a
kiss.
And
all
this
Anna
did,
and
took
her
in
her
arms
and
made
her
dance,
and
kissed
her
fresh
little
cheek
and
bare
little
elctions
but
at
the
sight
of
this
child
it
was
plainer
than
ever
to
her
that
the
feeling
she
had
for
her
could
not
be
called
love
in
comparison
with
what
she
felt
for
Sesa
Everything
in
this
baby
was
charming,
but
for
some
reason
all
this
did
not
go
deep
to
her
heart.
On
her
first
child,
though
the
child
of
an
unloved
father,
had
been
concentrated
all
the
love
that
had
never
found
satisfaction.
Her
baby
girl
had
been
born
in
the
most
painful
circumstances
and
had
not
had
a
hundredth
part
of
the
care
and
thought
which
had
been
concentrated
on
her
first
child.
Besides,
in
the
little
girl
everything
was
still
in
the
future,
while
Sesa
was
by
now
almost
a
personality,
and
a
personality
dearly
loved.
In
him
there
was
a
conflict
of
thought
and
feeling?
he
understood
her,
he
loved
her,
he
judged
her,
she
thought,
recalling
his
words
and
his
eyes.
And
she
was
forever.
physically
only
but
spiritually.
from
him,
and
it
was
impossible
to
set
this
right.
She
gave
the
baby
back
to
the
nurse,
let
her
go,
and
opened
the
lockets
in
which
there
was
Sesa
portrait
when
he
was
almost
of
the
same
age
as
the
girl.
She
got
up,
and,
taking
off
her
hat,
took
up
from
a
little
table
an
album
in
which
there
were
photographs
of
her
son
at
different
ages.
She
wanted
to
compare
them,
and
began
taking
them
out
of
the
album.
She
took
them
all
out
except
one,
the
latest
and
best
photograph.
In
it
he
was
in
a
white
smock,
sitting
astride
a
chair,
with
frowning
eyes
and
smiling
lips.
It
was
his
best,
most
characteristic
expression.
With
her
little
supple
hands,
her
white,
delicate
fingers,
that
moved
with
a
peculiar
intensity
today,
she
pulled
at
a
corner
of
the
photograph,
but
the
photograph
had
caught
somewhere,
and
she
could
not
get
it
out.
There
was
no
paper
knife
on
the
table,
and
so,
pulling
out
the
photograph
that
was
next
to
her
son's
(it
was
a
photograph
of
Vrye
taken
at
Rome
in
a
round
hat
and
with
long
hair).
she
used
it
to
push
out
her
son's
photograph.
"Oh,
here
is
he"
she
said,
glancing
at
the
portrait
of
Vrye
and
she
suddenly
recalled
that
he
was
the
cause
of
her
present
misery.
She
had
not
once
thought
of
him
all
the
morning.
But
now,
coming
all
at
once
upon
that
manly,
noble
face,
so
familiar
and
so
dear
to
her,
she
felt
a
sudden
rush
of
love
for
him.
"But
where
is
he?
How
is
it
he
leaves
me
alone
in
my
misfeasance,
she
thought
all
at
once
with
a
feeling
of
reproach,
forgetting
she
had
herself
kept
from
him
everything
concerning
her
son.
She
sent
to
ask
him
to
come
to
her
immediately;
with
a
throbbing
heart
she
awaited
him,
rehearsing
to
herself
the
words
in
which
she
would
tell
him
all,
and
the
expressions
of
love
with
which
he
would
console
her.
The
messenger
returned
with
the
answer
that
he
had
a
visitor
with
him,
but
that
he
would
come
immediately,
and
that
he
asked
whether
she
would
let
him
bring
with
him
Prince
Yasih
who
had
just
arrived
in
Petersburg.
"He's
not
coming
alone,
and
since
dinner
yesterday
he
has
not
seen
me,"
she
thought;
"he's
not
coming
so
that
I
could
tell
him
everything,
but
coming
with
Yasih
And
all
at
once
a
strange
idea
came
to
her:
what
if
he
had
ceased
to
love
her?
And
going
over
the
events
of
the
last
few
days,
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
saw
in
everything
a
confirmation
of
this
terrible
idea.
The
fact
that
he
had
not
dined
at
home
yesterday,
and
the
fact
that
he
had
insisted
on
their
taking
separate
sets
of
rooms
in
Petersburg,
and
that
even
now
he
was
not
coming
to
her
alone,
as
though
he
were
trying
to
avoid
meeting
her
face
to
face.
"But
he
ought
to
tell
me
so.
I
must
know
that
it
is
so.
If
I
knew
it,
then
I
know
what
I
should
do,"
she
said
to
herself,
utterly
unable
to
picture
to
herself
the
position
she
would
be
in
if
she
were
convinced
of
his
not
caring
for
her.
She
thought
he
had
ceased
to
love
her,
she
felt
close
upon
despair,
and
consequently
she
felt
exceptionally
alert.
She
rang
for
her
maid
and
went
to
her
dressing
room.
As
she
dressed,
she
took
more
care
over
her
appearance
than
she
had
done
all
those
days,
as
though
he
might,
if
he
had
grown
cold
to
her,
fall
in
love
with
her
again
because
she
had
dressed
and
arranged
her
hair
in
the
way
most
becoming
to
her.
She
heard
the
bell
ring
before
she
was
ready.
When
she
went
into
the
drawing
room
it
was
not
he,
but
Yasih
who
met
her
eyes.
Vrye
was
looking
through
the
photographs
of
her
son,
which
she
had
forgotten
on
the
table,
and
he
made
no
haste
to
look
round
at
her.
"We
have
met
already,"
she
said,
putting
her
little
hand
into
the
huge
hand
of
Yasih
whose
null
was
so
quei
out
of
keeping
with
his
immense
frame
and
coarse
face.
"We
met
last
year
at
the
races.
Give
them
to
me,"
she
said,
with
a
rapid
movement
snatching
from
Vrye
the
photographs
of
her
son,
and
glancing
significantly
at
him
with
flashing
eyes.
"Were
the
races
good
this
year?
Instead
of
them
I
saw
the
races
in
the
Corso
in
Rome.
But
you
don't
care
for
life
abroad,"
she
said
with
a
cordial
smile.
"I
know
you
and
all
your
tastes,
though
I
have
seen
so
little
of
you."
"I'm
awfully
sorry
for
that,
for
my
tastes
are
mostly
bad,"
said
Yasih
gnawing
at
his
left
mustache.
Having
talked
a
little
while,
and
noticing
that
Vrye
glanced
at
the
clock,
Yasih
asked
her
whether
she
would
be
staying
much
longer
in
Petersburg,
and
unbending
his
huge
figure
reached
after
his
cap.
"Not
long,
I
think,"
she
said
hesitation
glancing
at
Vrye
"So
then
we
shan't
meet
again?"
"Come
and
dine
with
me,"
said
Anna
resolutely."
angry
it
seemed
with
herself
for
her
embarrassment,
but
flushing
as
she
always
did
when
she
defined
her
position
before
a
fresh
person.
"The
dinner
here
is
not
good,
but
at
least
you
will
see
him.
There
is
no
one
of
his
old
friends
in
the
regiment
Alexey
cares
for
as
he
does
for
you."
"Delights
said
Yasih
with
a
smile,
from
which
Vrye
could
see
that
he
liked
Anna
very
much.
Yasih
said
good-bye
and
went
away;
Vrye
stayed
behind.
"Are
you
going
too?"
she
said
to
him.
"I'm
late
already,"
he
answered.
"Run
along"
I'll
catch
you
up
in
a
moment,"
he
called
to
Yasih
She
took
him
by
the
hand,
and
without
taking
her
eyes
off
him,
gazed
at
him
while
she
ransacked
her
mind
for
the
words
to
say
that
would
keep
him.
"Wait
a
minute,
there's
something
I
want
to
say
to
you,"
and
taking
his
broad
hand
she
pressed
it
on
her
neck.
"Oh,
was
it
right
my
asking
him
to
dinners
"You
did
quite
right,"
he
said
with
a
serene
smile
that
showed
his
even
teeth,
and
he
kissed
her
hand.
"Alias
you
have
not
changed
to
me?"
she
said,
pressing
his
hand
in
both
of
hers.
"Alias
I
am
miserable
here.
When
are
we
going
away?"
"Soon,
soon.
You
wouldn't
believe
how
disagreeable
our
way
of
living
here
is
to
me
too,"
he
said,
and
he
drew
away
his
hand.
"Well,
go,
go!"
she
said
in
a
tone
of
offense,
and
she
walked
quickly
away
from
him.
Chapter
32
When
Vrye
returned
home,
Anna
was
not
yet
home.
Soon
after
he
had
left,
some
lady,
so
they
told
him,
had
come
to
see
her,
and
she
had
gone
out
with
her.
That
she
had
gone
out
without
leaving
word
where
she
was
going,
that
she
had
not
yet
come
back,
and
that
all
the
morning
she
had
been
going
about
somewhere
without
a
word
to
him-her
this,
together
with
the
strange
look
of
excitement
in
her
face
in
the
morning,
and
the
recollection
of
the
hostile
tone
with
which
she
had
before
Yasih
almost
snatched
her
son's
photographs
out
of
his
hands,
made
him
serious.
He
decided
he
absolutely
must
speak
openly
with
her.
And
he
waited
for
her
in
her
drawing
room.
But
Anna
did
not
return
alone,
but
brought
with
her
her
old
unmarried
aunt,
Princess
Obninsk's
This
was
the
lady
who
had
come
in
the
morning,
and
with
whom
Anna
had
gone
out
shopping.
Anna
appeared
not
to
notice
Vrye
worried
and
inquiring
expression,
and
began
a
lively
account
of
her
morning's
shopping.
He
saw
that
there
was
something
working
within
her;
in
her
flashing
eyes,
when
they
rested
for
a
moment
on
him,
there
was
an
intense
concentration,
and
in
her
words
and
movements
there
was
that
nervous
rapidity
and
grace
which,
during
the
early
period
of
their
intimacy,"
had
so
fascinated
him,
but
which
now
so
disturbed
and
alarmed
him.
The
dinner
was
laid
for
four.
All
were
gathered
together
and
about
to
go
into
the
little
dining
room
when
Tushnet
made
his
appearance
with
a
message
from
Princess
null
Princess
Betsy
begged
her
to
excuse
her
not
having
come
to
say
good-driver
she
had
been
indisputable
but
begged
Anna
to
come
to
her
between
half-pay
six
and
nine
o'clock.
Vrye
glanced
at
Anna
at
the
precise
limit
of
time,
so
suggestive
of
steps
having
been
taken
that
she
should
meet
no
one;
but
Anna
appeared
not
to
notice
it.
"Very
sorry
that
I
can't
come
just
between
half-pay
six
and
nine,'
she
said
with
a
faint
smile.
"The
princess
will
be
very
sorry."
"And
so
am
I."
"You're
going,
no
doubt,
to
hear
Pattichis
said
Tushnet
"Patton"
You
suggest
the
idea
to
me.
I
would
go
if
it
were
possible
to
get
a
box."
"I
can
get
one,"
Tushnet
offered
his
services.
"I
should
be
very,
very
grateful
to
you,"
said
Anna.
"But
won't
you
dine
with
us?"
Vrye
gave
a
hardly
perceptible
shrug.
He
was
at
a
complete
loss
to
understand
what
Anna
was
about.
What
had
she
brought
the
old
Princess
Obninsk's
home
for,
what
had
she
made
Tushnet
stay
to
dinner
for,
and,
most
amazing
of
all,
why
was
she
sending
him
for
a
box?
Could
she
possibly
think
in
her
position
of
going
to
Patti's
benefit,
where
all
the
circle
of
her
acquaintances
would
be?
He
looked
at
her
with
serious
eyes,
but
she
responded
with
that
defiant,
half-mocking
half-destroyed
look,
the
meaning
of
which
he
could
not
comprehend.
At
dinner
Anna
was
in
aggressively
high
spirits-based
almost
flirted
both
with
Tushnet
and
with
Yasih
When
they
got
up
from
dinner
and
Tushnet
had
gone
to
get
a
box
at
the
opera,
Yasih
went
to
smoke,
and
Vrye
went
down
with
him
to
his
own
rooms.
After
sitting
there
for
some
time
he
ran
upstairs.
Anna
was
already
dressed
in
a
low-nicotine
gown
of
light
silk
and
velvet
that
she
had
had
made
in
Paris,
and
with
costly
white
lace
on
her
head,
framing
her
face,
and
particularly
becoming,
showing
up
her
dazzling
beauty.
"Are
you
really
going
to
the
theatergoer
he
said,
trying
not
to
look
at
her.
"Why
do
you
ask
with
such
alarmed
she
said,
wounded
again
at
his
not
looking
at
her.
"Why
shouldn't
I
go?"
She
appeared
not
to
understand
the
motive
of
his
words.
"Oh,
of
course,
there's
no
reason
whatever,"
he
said,
frowns
"That's
just
what
I
say,"
she
said,
willfully
refusing
to
see
the
irony
of
his
tone,
and
quietly
turning
back
her
long,
perfumed
glove.
"Anne
for
God's
sake"
what
is
the
matter
with
you?"
he
said,
appealing
to
her
exactly
as
once
her
husband
had
done.
"I
don't
understand
what
you
are
asking:
"You
know
that
it's
out
of
the
question
to
go."
"Why
so?
I'm
not
going
alone.
Princess
Varvara
has
gone
to
dress,
she
is
going
with
me."
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
an
air
of
perplexity
and
despair.
"But
do
you
mean
to
say
you
don't
knowable
he
began.
"But
I
don't
care
to
know"
she
almost
shriekers
"I
don't
care
to.
Do
I
regret
what
I
have
done?
No,
no,
no!
If
it
were
all
to
do
again
from
the
beginning,
it
would
be
the
same.
For
us,
for
you
and
for
me,
there
is
only
one
thing
that
matters,
whether
we
love
each
other.
Other
people
we
need
not
consider.
Why
are
we
living
here
apart
and
not
seeing
each
other?
Why
can't
I
go?
I
love
you,
and
I
don't
care
for
anything,"
she
said
in
Russian,
glancing
at
him
with
a
peculiar
gleam
in
her
eyes
that
he
could
not
understand.
"If
you
have
not
changed
to
me,
why
don't
you
look
at
me?"
He
looked
at
her.
He
saw
all
the
beauty
of
her
face
and
full
dress,
always
so
becoming
to
her.
But
now
her
beauty
and
elegance
were
just
what
irritated
him.
"My
feeling
cannot
change,
you
know,
but
I
beg
you,
I
entreat
you,"
he
said
again
in
French,
with
a
note
of
tender
supplied
in
his
voice,
but
with
coldness
in
his
eyes.
She
did
not
hear
his
words,
but
she
saw
the
coldness
of
his
eyes,
and
answered
with
irritations
"And
I
beg
you
to
explain
why
I
should
not
go."
"Because
it
might
cause
you:
he
hesitated.
"I
don't
understand.

Oh,

Chapter
33
Vrye
for
the
first
time
experienced
a
feeling
of
anger
against
Anna,
almost
a
hatred
for
her
willfully
refusing
to
understand
her
own
position.
This
feeling
was
aggravated
by
his
being
unable
to
tell
her
plainly
the
cause
of
his
anger.
If
he
had
told
her
directly
what
he
was
thinking,
he
would
have
said:
"In
that
dress,
with
a
princess
only
too
well
known
to
everyone,
to
show
yourself
at
the
theater
is
equivalent
not
merely
to
acknowledging
your
position
as
a
fallen
woman,
but
is
flinging
down
a
challenge
to
society,
that
is
to
say,
cutting
yourself
off
from
it
forever."
He
could
not
say
that
to
her.
"But
how
can
she
fail
to
see
it,
and
what
is
going
on
in
her?"
he
said
to
himself.
He
felt
at
the
same
time
that
his
respect
for
her
was
diminished
while
his
sense
of
her
beauty
was
intensified.
He
went
back
scowling
to
his
rooms,
and
sitting
down
beside
Yasih
who,
with
his
long
legs
stretched
out
on
a
chair,
was
drinking
brandy
and
seltzer
water,
he
ordered
a
glass
of
the
same
for
himself.
"You
were
talking
of
Lankton,
Powergen's
That's
a
fine
horse,
and
I
would
advise
you
to
buy
him,"
said
Yasih
glancing
at
his
comrade's
gloomy
face.
"His
hind-stalking
aren't
quite
first-rate,
but
the
legs
and
head-and-neck
couldn't
wish
for
anything
better."
"I
think
I
will
take
him,"
answered
Vrye
Their
conversation
about
horses
interested
him,
but
he
did
not
for
an
instant
forget
Anna,
and
could
not
help
listening
to
the
sound
of
steps
in
the
corridor
and
looking
at
the
clock
on
the
chimney
piece.
"Anna
Arkalyk
gave
orders
to
announce
that
she
has
gone
to
the
theater."
Yasih
tipping
another
glass
of
brandy
into
the
bubbling
water,
drank
it
and
got
up,
buttons
his
coat.
"Well,
let's
go,"
he
said,
faintly
smiling
under
his
mustache,
and
showing
by
this
smile
that
he
knew
the
cause
of
Vrye
gloomy
and
did
not
attach
any
significance
to
it.
"I'm
not
going,"
Vrye
answered
gloomy
"Well,
I
must,
I
promised
to.
Good-bye."'
then.
If
you
do,
come
to
the
stalwart
you
can
take
Kryla
stall,"
added
Yasih
as
he
went
out.
"No,
I'm
busy."
"A
wife
is
a
care,
but
it's
worse
when
she's
not
a
wife,"
thought
Yasih
as
he
walked
out
of
the
hotel.
Vrye
left
alone,
got
up
from
his
chair
and
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
room.
"And
what's
today?
The
fourth
night:
Yegor
and
his
wife
are
there,
and
my
mother,
most
likely.
Of
course
all
Petersburg's
there.
Now
she's
gone
in,
taken
off
her
cloak
and
come
into
the
light.
Tushnet
Yasih
Princess
Varvares
he
pictured
them
to
himself:
"What
about
me?
Either
that
I'm
frightened
or
have
given
up
to
Tushnet
the
right
to
protect
her?
From
every
point
of
view-protection
stupid"
And
why
is
she
putting
me
in
such
a
position?"
he
said
with
a
gesture
of
despair.
With
that
gesture
he
knocked
against
the
table,
on
which
there
was
standing
the
seltzer
water
and
the
decanters
of
brandy,
and
almost
upset
it.
He
tried
to
catch
it,
let
it
slip,
and
angrily
kicked
the
table
over
and
rang.
"If
you
care
to
be
in
my
service,"
he
said
to
the
valet
who
came
in,
"you
had
better
remember
your
duties.
This
shouldn't
be
here.
You
ought
to
have
cleared
away."
The
valet,
conscious
of
his
own
innocence,
would
have
defended
himself,
but
glancing
at
his
master,
he
saw
from
his
face
that
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
be
silent,
and
hurriedly
threading
his
way
in
and
out,
dropped
down
on
the
carpet
and
began
gathering
up
the
whole
and
broken
glasses
and
bottles.
"That's
not
your
duty?
send
the
waiter
to
clear
away,
and
get
my
dress
coat
out."
Vrye
went
into
the
theater
at
half-pay
eight.
The
performance
was
in
full
swing.
The
little
old
box-like
recognizing
Vrye
as
he
helped
him
off
with
his
fur
coat,
called
him
"Your
Excellent
and
suggested
he
should
not
take
a
number
but
should
simply
call
Fyodorov
In
the
brightly
lighted
corridor
there
was
no
one
but
the
box-set
and
two
attendants
with
fur
cloaks
on
their
arms
listening
at
the
doors.
Through
the
closed
doors
came
the
sounds
of
the
discreet
_subscribed
accompaniment
of
the
orchestra,
and
a
single
female
voice
rendering
distinctly
a
musical
phrase.
The
door
opened
to
let
the
box-set
slip
through,
and
the
phrase
drawing
to
the
end
reached
Vrye
hearing
clearly.
But
the
doors
were
closed
again
at
once,
and
Vrye
did
not
hear
the
end
of
the
phrase
and
the
cadence
of
the
accompaniment,
though
he
knew
from
the
thunder
of
applause
that
it
was
over.
When
he
entered
the
hall,
brilliantly
lighted
with
chandeliers
and
gas
jets,
the
noise
was
still
going
on.
On
the
stage
the
singer,
bowing
and
smiling,
with
bare
shoulders
flashing
with
diamonds,
was,
with
the
help
of
the
tenor
who
had
given
her
his
arm,
gathering
up
the
bouquets
that
were
flying
awkwardly
over
the
footlocker
Then
she
went
up
to
a
gentleman
with
glossy
pomades
hair
parted
down
the
center,
who
was
stretching
across
the
footlights
holding
out
something
to
her,
and
all
the
public
in
the
stalls
as
well
as
in
the
boxes
was
in
excitement,
craning
forward,
shouting
and
clapping.
The
conductor
in
his
high
chair
assisted
in
passing
the
offering,
and
straightened
his
white
tie.
Vrye
walked
into
the
middle
of
the
stalls,
and,
standing
still,
began
looking
about
him.
That
day
less
than
ever
was
his
attention
turned
upon
the
familiar,
habitual
surroundings,
the
stage,
the
noise,
all
the
familiar,
uninteresting,
particpating
herd
of
spectators
in
the
packed
theater.
There
were,
as
always,
the
same
ladies
of
some
sort
with
officers
of
some
sort
in
the
back
of
the
boxful
the
same
gaily
dressed
women-in-medicine
knows
who-does-what
uniforms
and
black
coattail
the
same
dirty
crowd
in
the
upper
galley
and
among
the
crowd,
in
the
boxes
and
in
the
front
rows,
were
some
forty
of
the
_received
people.
And
to
those
oases
Vrye
at
once
directed
his
attention,
and
with
them
he
entered
at
once
into
relation.
The
act
was
over
when
he
went
in,
and
so
he
did
not
go
straight
to
his
brother's
box,
but
going
up
to
the
first
row
of
stalls
stopped
at
the
footlights
with
Sesa
who,
standing
with
one
knee
raised
and
his
heel
on
the
footlocker
caught
sight
of
him
in
the
distance
and
beckoned
to
him,
smiling.
Vrye
had
not
yet
seen
Anna.
He
purposely
avoided
looking
in
her
direction.
But
he
knew
by
the
direction
of
people's
eyes
where
she
was.
He
looked
round
discreetly.
but
he
was
not
seeking
her;
expecting
the
worst,
his
eyes
sought
for
Alexey
Alexei
To
his
relief
Alexey
Alexei
was
not
in
the
theater
that
evening.
"How
little
of
the
military
man
there
is
left
in
you!"
Sesa
was
saying
to
him.
"A
diplomat,
an
artist,
something
of
that
sort,
one
would
say."
"Yes,
it
was
like
going
back
home
when
I
put
on
a
black
coat,"
answered
Vrye
smiling
and
slowly
taking
out
his
opera
glass.
"Well,
I'll
own
I
envy
you
there.
When
I
come
back
from
abroad
and
put
on
this,"
he
touched
his
epecially
"I
regret
my
freedom."
Sesa
had
long
given
up
all
hope
of
Vrye
career,
but
he
liked
him
as
before,
and
was
now
particularly
cordial
to
him.
"What
a
pity
you
were
not
in
time
for
the
first
act"
Vrye
listening
with
one
ear,
moved
his
opera
glass
from
the
stalls
and
scanned
the
boxes.
Near
a
lady
in
a
turban
and
a
bald
old
man,
who
seemed
to
wave
angrily
in
the
moving
opera
glass,
Vrye
suddenly
caught
sight
of
Anna's
head,
proud,
strikingly
beautiful,
and
smiling
in
the
frame
of
lace.
She
was
in
the
fifth
box,
twenty
paces
from
him.
She
was
sitting
in
front,
and
slightly
turning,
was
saying
something
to
Yasih
The
setting
of
her
head
on
her
handsome,
broad
shoulders,
and
the
restrained
excitement
and
brilliance
of
her
eyes
and
her
whole
face
reminded
him
of
her
just
as
he
had
seen
her
at
the
ball
in
Moscow.
But
he
felt
utterly
different
towards
her
beauty
now.
In
his
feeling
for
her
now
there
was
no
element
of
mystery,
and
so
her
beauty,
though
it
attracted
him
even
more
intensely
than
before,
gave
him
now
a
sense
of
injury.
She
was
not
looking
in
his
direction,
but
Vrye
felt
that
she
had
seen
him
already.
When
Vrye
turned
the
opera
glass
again
in
that
direction,
he
noticed
that
Princess
Varvara
was
particularly
red,
and
kept
laughing
unnaturally
and
looking
round
at
the
next
box.
Anna,
folding
her
fan
and
tapping
it
on
the
red
velvet,
was
gazing
away
and
did
not
see,
and
obviously
did
not
wish
to
see,
what
was
taking
place
in
the
next
box.
Yasih
face
wore
the
expression
which
was
common
when
he
was
losing
at
cards.
Scrabble
he
sucked
the
left
end
of
his
mustache
further
and
further
into
his
mouth,
and
cast
sideman
glances
at
the
next
box.
In
that
box
on
the
left
were
the
Kartchner
Vrye
knew
them,
and
knew
that
Anna
was
acquainted
with
them.
Madame
Kartchner
a
thin
little
woman,
was
standing
up
in
her
box,
and,
her
back
turned
upon
Anna,
she
was
putting
on
a
mantle
that
her
husband
was
holding
for
her.
Her
face
was
pale
and
angry,
and
she
was
talking
excitedly.
Kartchner
a
fat,
bald
man,
was
continually
looking
round
at
Anna,
while
he
attempted
to
soothe
his
wife.
When
the
wife
had
gone
out,
the
husband
lingered
a
long
while,
and
tried
to
catch
Anna's
eye,
obviously
anxious
to
bow
to
her.
But
Anna,
with
unmistakable
intention,
avoided
noticing
him,
and
talked
to
Yasih
whose
cropped
head
was
bent
down
to
her.
Kartchner
went
out
without
making
his
salutations
and
the
box
was
left
empty.
Vrye
could
not
understand
exactly
what
had
passed
between
the
Kartchner
and
Anna,
but
he
saw
that
something
humiliating
for
Anna
had
happened.
He
knew
this
both
from
what
he
had
seen,
and
most
of
all
from
the
face
of
Anna,
who,
he
could
see,
was
taxing
every
nerve
to
carry
through
the
part
she
had
taken
up.
And
in
maintaining
this
attitude
of
external
composure
she
was
completely
successful.
Anyone
who
did
not
know
her
and
her
circle,
who
had
not
heard
all
the
utterances
of
the
women
expressive
of
commiserative
indignation,
and
amazement,
that
she
should
show
herself
in
society,
and
show
herself
so
conspicuously
with
her
lace
and
her
beauty,
would
have
admired
the
serenity
and
loveliness,
of
this
woman
without
a
suspicion
that
she
was
undergoing
the
sensations
of
a
man
in
the
stocks.
Knowing
that
something
had
happened,
but
not
knowing
precisely
what,
Vrye
felt
a
thrill
of
agonizing
anxiety,
and
hoping
to
find
out
something,
he
went
towards
his
brother's
box.
Purras
choosing
the
way
round
furthest
from
Anna's
box,
he
jostled
as
he
came
out
against
the
colonel
of
his
old
regiment
talking
to
two
acquaintances.
Vrye
heard
the
name
of
Madame
Karennis
and
noticed
how
the
colonel
hastened
to
address
Vrye
loudly
by
name,
with
a
meaning
glance
at
his
companions.
"Ah,
Vrye
When
are
you
coming
to
the
regiment?'
We
can't
let
you
off
without
a
supper.
You're
one
of
the
old
set,"
said
the
colonel
of
his
regiment.
"I
can't
stop,
awfully
sorry,
another
time,"
said
Vrye
and
he
ran
upstairs
towards
his
brother's
box.
The
old
countess,
Vrye
mother,
with
her
steel-gray
curls,
was
in
his
brother's
box.
Varya,
with
the
young
Princess
Sorokko
met
him
in
the
corridor.
Leaving
the
Princess
Sorokko
with
her
mother,
Varya,
held
out
her
hand
to
her
brother-in-law,
and
began
immediately
to
speak
of
what
interested
him.
She
was
more
excited
than
he
had
ever
seen
her.
"I
think
it's
mean
and
null
and
Madame
Kartchner
had
no
right
to
do
it.
Madame
Karennis
she
began.
"But
what
is
it?
I
don't
know."
"Whatever
you've
not
heard?"
"You
know
I
should
be
the
last
person
to
hear
of
it."
"There
isn't
a
more
spiteful
creature
than
that
Madame
Kartchner
"But
what
did
she
do?"
"My

told
me:
She

Madame
Karennis
Her
husband
began
talking
to
her
across
the
box,
and
Madame
Kartchner
made
a
scene.
She
said
something
aloud,
he
says,
something
insulting,"
and
went
away."
"Countdown
your

for
you,"
said
the
young
Princess
Sorokko
peeping
out
of
the
door
of
the
box.
"I've
been
expecting
you
all
the
while,"
said
his
mother,
smiling
sarcastically.
"You
were
nowhere
to
be
seen."
Her
son
saw
that
she
could
not
suppress
a
smile
of
delight.
"Good
evening,
mamas
I
have
come
to
you,"
he
said
coldly.
"Why

At

for

his
heart.

went
down,
and
made
straight
for

At

said
to

ironically,
he
thought,
at
him.
"I
am
a

he
said,
looking
sternly
at
her.
"Like

said
smiling,
"who

"Thank

she
said,

and

instant

She
got
up
and
went
into
the
interior
of
the

Noticing
in
the

was
empty,
Vrye
rousing

in
the
silent

went
out
in
the

of
a

and
drove
home.
Anna
was
already
at
home.
When
Vrye
went
up
to
her,
she
was
in
the
same
dress
as
she
had
worn
at
the
theater.
She
was
sitting
in
the
first
armchair
against
the
wall,
looking
straight
before
her.
She
looked
at
him,
and
at
once
resumed
her
former
position.
"Anne

said.
"You,
you
are
to
blame
for

she
cried,
with
tears
of
despair
and

in
her
voice,
getting
up.
"I

not

she
cried.

shall
never

She
said
it
was
a
disgrace
to
sit
beside
me."
"A

he
said:
"but

"Oh,

she
said,
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
of
terror.
He
was
sorry
for
her,
and
angry
notwithstanding.
He
assured
her
of
his
love
because
he
saw
that
this
was
the
only
means
of
soothing
her,
and
he
did
not
reproach
her
in
words,
but
in
his
heart
he
reproached
her.
And
the
assication,
of
his
love,
which
seemed
to
him
so
vulgar
that
he
was
ashamed
to
utter

she

became
calmer.

they

the
summer
with
her
children
at
Pokrovsky

her
sister
Kitty
Levin,
The
house
on
her
own
estate
was
quite
in
ruins,
and
Levin
and
his
wife
had
persuaded
her
to
spend
the
summer
with
them.
Stepan
Arkalyk
greatly
approved
of
the
arrangement.
He
said
he
was
very
sorry
his
official
duties
prevented
him
from
spending
the
summer
in
the
country
with
his
family,
which
would
have
been
the
greatest
happiness
for
him;
and
remaining
in
Moscow,
he
came
down
to
the
country
from
time
to
time
for
a
day
or
two.
Besides
the
Obninsk's
with
all
their
children
and
their
governess,
the
old
princess
too
came
to
stay
that
summer
with
the
Levins,
as
she
considered
it
her
duty
to
watch
over
her
inexperienced
daughter
in
her

Varese
Kitty,
friend
abroad,
kept
her
promise
to
come
to
Kitty
when
she
was
married,
and
stayed
with
her
friend.
All
of
these
were
friends
or
relations
of
Levin's
wife.
And
though
he
liked
them
all,
he
rather
regretted
his
own
Levin
world
and
ways,
which
was
smothered
by
this
influx
of
the
"Shu"
element,"
as
he
called
it
to
himself.
Of
his
own
relations
there
stayed
with
him
only
Sergey
Ivanovo.
but
he
too
was
a
man
of
the

and
not
the
Levin
stamp,
so
that
the
Levin
spirit
was
utterly
obliterated.
In

house,
so
long
deserted,
there
were
now
so
many
people
that
almost
all
the
rooms
were
occupied,
and
almost
every
day
it
happened
that
the
old
princess,
sitting
down
to
table,
counted
them
all
over,
and
put
the
thirties
grandson
or
granddaughter
at
a
separate
table.
And
Kitty,
with
her
careful
housekeeping,"
had
no
little
trouble
to
get
all
the
chickens,
turkeys,
and
geese,
of
which
so
many
were
needed
to
satisfy
the
summer
appetites
of
the
visitors
and
children.
The
whole
family
were
sitting
at
dinner.
Dolly,
children,
with
their
governess
and
Varese
were
making
plans
for
going
to
look
for
mushrooms.

up
to

all
the
party
for
his
intellect
and
learning,
with
a
respect
that
almost
amounted
to
awe,
surprised
everyone
by
joining
in
the
conversation
about
mushrooms.
"Take
me
with
you.
I
am
very
fond
of
picking
mushrooms.
he
said,
looking
at
Varese
"I
think
it's
a
very
nice
occupation."
"Oh,
we
shall
be
delighted,"
answered
Varese
coloring
a
little.
Kitty
exchanged
meaningful
glances
with
Dolly.
The
proposal
of
the
learned
and
intellectual
Sergey

to
go
looking
for
mushrooms
with
Varese
confirmed
certain
theories
of
Kitty,
with
which
her
mind
had
been
very
busy
of
late.
She
made
haste
to
address
some
remark
to
her
mother,
so
that
her
look
should
not
be
noticed.

with
his
cup
of
coffee
at
the
drawing-room
window,
and
while
he
took
part
in
a
conversation
he
had
begun
with
his
brother,
he
watched
the
door
through
which
the
children
would
start
on
the
mushroom-shaped
expedition.
Levin
was
sitting
in
the
window
near
his
brother.
Kitty
stood
beside
her
husband,
evidently
awaiting
the
end
of
a
conversation
that
had
no
interest
for
her,
in
order
to
tell
him
something.
"You
have
changed
in
many
respects
since
your

and
for
the
better,"
said
Sergey
Ivanovo.

with

rapid
steps
up
to
Kitty.
The
rapidity
of
her
movement,
her
flushed
and
eager
face,
everything
betrayed
that
something
out
of
the
common
was
going
on
in
her.
Kitty
knew
what
this
was,
and
had
been
watching
her
intently.
She
called
Varese
at
that
moment
merely
in
order
mentally
to
give
her
a
blessing
for
the
important
event
which,
as
Kitty

was
bound
to
come
to
pass
that
day
after

she
whispered
as
she
kissed
her.
"And
are
you
coming

Varese
said
to
Levin
in
confusion,
pretending
not
to
have
heard
what
had
been
said.
"I
am
coming,
but
only
as
far
as

there
I
shall
stop."
"Why,
what
do

want

said
Kitty.
"I
must
go
to
have

look
at

wagons,
and
to

said
Levindale
"and

Chapter
2
On
the
terrace
were
assembled
all
the
ladies
of
the
party.
They
always
liked
sitting
there
after
dinner,
and
that
day
they
had
work
to
do
there
too.
Besides
the
sewing
and
knitting
of
baby
clothes,
with
which
all
of
them
were
busy,
that
afternoon
jam
was
being
made
on
the
terrace
by
a
method
new
to
Agag
Mihalowski
without
the
addition
of
water.
Kitty
had
introduced
this
new
method,
which
had
been
in
use
in
her
home.
Agag
Mihalowski
to
whom
the
task
of
jam-packed
had
always
been
intuited
considering
that
what
had
been
done
in
the
Levin
household
could
not
be
amiss,
had
nevertheless
put
water
with
the
strawberries,
maintaining
that
the
jam
could
not
be
made
without
it.
She
had
been
caught
in
the
act,
and
was
now
making
jam
before
everyone,
and
it
was
to
be
proved
to
her
conclusively
that
jam
could
be
very
well
made
without
water.
Agag

and

over
the
charcoal
stove,
looking
darkly
at
the
raspberries
and
devoutly
hoping
they
would
stick
and
not
cook
properly.
The
princess,
conscious
that
Agag
Mihalowski
wrath
must
be
chiefly
directed
against
her,
as
the
person
responsible
for
the
raspberry
jam-packed
tried
to
appear
to
be
absorbed
in
other
things
and
not
interested
in
the
jam,
talked
of
other
matters,
but
cast
stealthy
glances
in
the
direction
of
the
stove.
"I
always
buy
my
maids,
dresses
myself,
of
some
cheap
material,"
the
princess
said,
continuing
the
previous
conversation.
"Isn't
it
time
to
skim
it,
my
dearer
she
added,
addressing
Agag
Mihalowski
"There's
not
the
slightest
need
for
you
to
do
it,
and
it's
hot
for
you,"
she
said,
stopping
Kitty.
"I'll
do
it,"
said
Dolly,
and
getting
up,
she
carefully
passed
the
spoon
over
the
frothy
sugar,
and
from
time
to
time
shook
off
the
clinging
jam
from
the
spoon
by
knocking
it
on
a
plate
that
was
covered
with
yellow-spotted
scum
and
blood-contaminated
syrup.
"How
they'll
enjoy
this
at

she
thought
of
her
children,
remembering
how
she
herself
as
a
child
had
wondered
how
it
was

not
eat
what

of
the

"Stock
says
it's
much
better
to

Dolly
took
up
meanwhile
the
weighty
subject
under
discussion,
what
presents
should
be
made
to
servants.
"Butch
"Money,"
out
of
the
question"
the
princess
and
Kitty
exclaimed
with
one
voice.
"They

a

"Well,

for

I

the

"Well,
now
I
think
it's
done,"
said
Dolly,
dropping
the
syrup
from
the
spoon.
"When
it
sets
as
it

angrily.
"It'll

she
added.
"Ah!

Kitty
said
suddenly,
looking
at
a
sparrow
that
had
settled
on
the
step
and
was
pecking
at
the
center
of
a
raspberry.
"Yes,

said
her

assenting

a

and
recalling

with

how
did

Kitty
asked
suddenly.
"There
was
nothing
out
of
the
way,
it
was
very
simple,"
answered
the
princess,
but
her
face
beamed
all
over
at
the
recollection.
"Oh,
but
how
was
it?
You
loved
him,
anyway,
before
you
were
allowed

Kitty
felt
a
peculiar
pleasure
in
being
able
now
to
talk
to
her
mother
on
equal
terms
about
those
questions
of
such
paramount
interest
in
a
woman's
life.
"Of
course
I
did;
he
had
come
to
stay
with
us
in
the
country."
"But
how
was
it
settled
between
you,
mammal
"You
imagine,
I
dare
say,
that
you
invented
something
quite
new?
It's
always
just
the
same:
it
was
settled
by
the
eyes,
by
smiles:
"How
nicely
you
said
that,
mammal
It's
just
by
the
eyes,
by
smiles
that
it's
done,"
Dolly
assenting
"But
what
words
did
he
say?"
"What
did
Kostyra,
say
to
you?"
"He
wrote
it
in
chalk.
It
was
wonderful:
How
long
ago
it
seems"
she
said.
And
the
three
women
all
fell
to
musing
on
the
same
thing.
Kitty
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence.
She
remembered
all
that
last
winter
before
her
marriage,
and
her
passion
for
Vrye
"There's
one
thing
...
that
old
love
affair
of
Varese
she
said,
a
natural
chain
of
ideas
bringing
her
to
this
point.
"I
should
have
liked
to
say
something
to
Sergey

to
prepare
him.
They're
all-African

I
mean,"
she
added,
"awfully
jealous
over
our
past."
"Not
all,"
said
Dolly.
"You
judge
by
your
own
husband.
It
makes
him
miserable
even
now
to
remember
Vrye
Ehart
that's
true,
isn't
it?"
"Yes,"
Kitty
answered,
a
pensive
smile
in
her
eyes.
"But
I
really
don't
know,"
the
mother
put
in
in
defense
of
her
motherly
care
of
her
daughter,
"what
there
was
in
your
past
that
could
worry
him?
That
Vrye
paid
you

to
every

"Oh,
yes,
but
we
didn't
mean
that,"
Kitty
said,
flushing
a
little.
"No,
let
me
speak,"
her
mother
went
on,
"whys"
you
yourself
would
not
let
me
have
a
talk
to

you
remember?"'
"Oh,
mammal
said
Kitty,
with
an
expression
of
suffering.
"There's
no
keeping
you
young
people
in
check
nowadays:
Your
friendship
could
not
have
gone
beyond
what
was
suitable.
I
should
myself
have
called
upon
him
to
explain
himself.
But,
my
darling,
it's
not
right
for
you
to
be
agitated.
Please
remember
that,
and
calm
yourself."
"I'm
perfectly
calm,
mamas
"How
happy
it
was
for
Kitty
that
Anna
came
then,"
said
Dolly,
"and
how
unhappy
for
her.
It
turned
out
quite
the
opposite,"
she
said,
struck
by
her
own
ideas.
"Then
Anna
was
so
happy,
and
Kitty
thought
herself
unhappy.
Now
it
is
just
the
opposite.
I
often
think
of
her."
"A
nice
person
to
think
about!,"
Horrifido,
repulsive
woman-owned
heart,"
said
her
mother,
who
could
not
forget
that
Kitty
had
married
not
Vrye
but
Levin.
"What
do
you
want
to
talk
of
it
for?"
Kitty
said
with
annoyance.
"I
never
think
about
it,
and
I
don't
want
to
think
of
it:
And
I
don't
want
to
think
of
it,"
she
said,
catching
the
sound
of
her
husband's
well-known
step
on
the
steps
of
the
terrace.
"What's
that
you
don't
want
to
think
about?"
inquired
Levin,
coming
onto
the
terrace.
But
no
one
answered
him,
and
he
did
not
repeat
the
question.
"I'm
sorry
I've
broken
in
on
your
feminine
parliament,"
he
said,
looking
round
on
every
one
discontents
and
perceiving
that
they
had
been
talking
of
something
which
they
would
not
talk
about
before
him.
For
a
second
he
felt
that
he
was
sharing
the
feeling
of
Agag
Mihalowski
vexatious
at
their
making
jam
without
water,
and
altogether
at
the
outside
Shtern
element.
He
smiled,
however,
and
went
up
to
Kitty.
"Well,
how
are
you?"
he
asked
her,
looking
at
her
with
the
expression
with
which
everyone
looked
at
her
now.
"Oh,
very
well,"
said
Kitty,
smiling,
"and
how
have
things
gone
with
you?"
"The
wagons
held
three
times
as
much
as
the
old
carts
did.
Well,
are
we
going
for
the
children?
I've
ordered
the
horses
to
be
put
in."
"What's
you
want
to

Kitty
in
the
wagons
her
mother
said
reproaching
"Yes,

the

the
princess
disliked
his
not

But
though
he
liked
and
respected
the
princess,
Levin
could
not
call
her
so
without
a
sense
of
profaning
his
feeling
for
his
dead
mother.
"Come

Kitty.
"I
don't

"Well,
I'll
walk
then,
I'm
so

Kitty
got
up
and
went
to
her
husband
and
took
his
hand.
"You
may
be
well,
but
everything
in
moderation,"
said
the
princess.
"Well,
Agag
Mihalowski

the

said
Levin,
smiling
to
Agag
Mihalowski
and
trying
to
cheer
her
up.
"Is
it
all
right
in
the
new
way?"
"I
suppose
it's
all
right.
For
our
notions
it's
boiled
too
long."
"It'll
be

the

said
Kitty,
at
once
divining
her
husband's
motive,
and
addressing
the
old
housekeeper
with
the
same
feeling?
"but
your
pickle,
so
good,
that
mammal
says
she
never

she
added,
smiling,
and
putting
her
kerchief
straight.
Agag

looked
angrily
at
Kitty.
"You

to

me,
mistress.
I

only
to

she
said,

in

"Come

Agag

smiled
and
shook
her
head,
as
though
to
say:

Chapter
3
Kitty
was
particularly
glad
of
a
chance
of
being
alone
with
her
husband,
for
she
had
noticed
the
shade
of
mortification
that
had
passed
over
his
face-cracking
so
quick
to
reflect
every
feeling-contemplative
the
moment
when
he
had
come
onto
the
terrace
and
asked
what
they
were
talking
of,
and
had
got
no
answer.
When
they
had
set
off
on
foot
ahead
of
the
others,
and
had
come
out
of
sight
of
the
house
onto
the
beaten
dusty
road,
marked
with
rusty
wheels
and
sprinkled
with
grains
of
corn,
she
clung
faster
to
his
arm
and
pressed
it
closer
to
her.
He
had
quite
forgotten
the
momentary
unpleasant
impression,
and
alone
with
her
he
felt,
now
that
the
thought
of
her
approaching
motherhood
was
never
for
a
moment
absent
from
his
mind,
a
new
and
delicious
bliss.
quite
pure
from
all
alloy
of
sense,
in
the
being
near
to
the
woman
he
loved.
There
was
no
need
of
speech,
yet
he
longed
to
hear
the
sound
of
her
voice,
which
like
her
eyes
had
changed
since
she
had
been
with
child.
In
her
voice,
as
in
her
eyes,
there
was
that
softness
and
gravity
which
is
found
in
people
continually
concentrated
on
some
cherished
pursuit.
"So
you're
not
tired?
Lean
more
on
me,"
said
he.
"No,
I'm
so
glad
of
a
chance
of
being
alone
with
you,
and
I
must
own,
though
I'm
happy
with
them,
I
do
regret
our
winter
evenings
alone."
"That
was
good,
but
this
is
even
better.
Both
are
better,"
he
said,
squeezing
her
hand.
"Do
you
know
what
we
were
talking
about
when
you
came
in?"
"About
null
"Oh,
yes,
about
jam
too;
but
afterwards,
about
how
men
make
offers."
"Ah,
said
Levin,
listening
more
to
the
sound
of
her
voice
than
to
the
words
she
was
saying,
and
all
the
while
paying
attention
to
the
road,
which
passed
now
through
the
forest,
and
avoiding
places
where
she
might
make
a
false
step.
"And
about
Sergey
Ivanovo.
and
Varese
You've
notices
I'm
very
anxious
for
it,"
she
went
on.
"What
do
you
think
about
it?"
And
she
peepers
into
his
face.
"I
don't
know
what
to
think,"
Levin
answered,
smiling.
"Series
seems
very
strange
to
me
in
that
way.
I
told
you,
you
know:
"Yes,
that
he
was
in
love
with
that
girl
who
died:
"That
was
when
I
was
a
child;
I
know
about
it
from
hearsay
and
tradition.
I
remember
him
then.
He
was
wonderfully
sweet.
But
I've
watched
him
since
with
women;
he
is
friendly,
some
of
them
he
likes,
but
one
feels
that
to
him
they're
simply
people,
not
women."
"Yes,
but
now
with
Varese
...
I
fancy
there's
something:
"Perhaps
there
isue.
But
one
has
to
know
him:
He's
a
peculiar,
wonderful
person.
He
lives
a
spiritual
life
only.
He's
too
pure,
too
exalted
a
nature."
"Why?
Would
this
lower
him,
then?"
"No,
but
he's
so
used
to
a
spiritual
life
that
he
can't
reconcile
himself
with
actual
fact,
and
Varese
is
after
all
fact."
Levin
had
grown
used
by
now
to
uttering
his
thought
boldly,
without
taking
the
trouble
of
clothing
it
in
exact
language.
He
knew
that
his
wife,
in
such
moments
of
loving
tenderness
as
now,
would
understand
what
he
meant
to
say
from
a
hint,
and
she
did
understand
him.
"Yes,
but
there's
not
so
much
of
that
actual
fact
about
her
as
about
me.
I
can
see
that
he
would
never
have
cared
for
me.
She
is
altogether
null
"Oh,
no,
he
is
so
fond
of
you,
and
I
am
always
so
glad
when
my
people
like
you:
"Yes,
he's
very
nice
to
me;
but:
"It's
not
as
it
was
with
poor
Nikolay
...
you
really
cared
for
each
other,"
Levin
finished.
"Why
not
speak
of
him?"
he
added.
"I
sometimes
blame
myself
for
not;
it
ends
in
one's
forgetting."
Ah,
how
terrible
and
dear
he
was"
Yes,
what
were
we
talking
about?"
Levin
said,
after
a
pause.
"You
think
he
can't
fall
in
love,"
said
Kitty,
translating
into
her
own
language.
"It's
not
so
much
that
he
can't
fall
in
love,"
Levin
said,
smiling,
"but
he
has
not
the
weakness
necessary:
I've
always
envied
him,
and
even
now,
when
I'm
so
happy,
I
still
envy
him."
"You
envy
him
for
not
being
able
to
fall
in
love?"
"I
envy
him
for
being
better
than
I,"
said
Levin.
"He
does
not
live
for
himself.
His
whole
life
is
subordinated
to
his
duty.
And
that's
why
he
can
be
calm
and
contentedly
"And
you?"
Kitty
asked,
with
an
ironical
and
loving
smile.
She
could
never
have
explained
the
chain
of
thought
that
made
her
smile?
but
the
last
link
in
it
was
that
her
husband,
in
exalting
his
brother
and
abate
himself,
was
not
quite
sincere.
Kitty
knew
that
this
insinuate
came
from
his
love
for
his
brother,
from
his
sense
of
shame
at
being
too
happy,
and
above
all
from
his
unflagging
craving
to
be
better-armed
loved
it
in
him,
and
so
she
smiled.
"And
you?
What
are
you
dissatisfied
with?"
she
asked,
with
the
same
smile.
Her
disbelief
in
his
self-distributed
delighted
him,
and
unconsciously
he
tried
to
draw
her
into
giving
utterance
to
the
grounds
of
her
disbelief.
"I
am
happy,
but
dissatisfied
with
myself:
he
said.
"Why,
how
can
you
be
dissatisfied
with
yourself
if
you
are
happy?"
"Well,
how
shall
I
sayd
In
my
heart
I
really
care
for
nothing
whatever
but
that
you
should
not
stumble.
Oh,
but
really
you
mustn't
skip
about
like
that"
he
cried,
breaking
off
to
scold
her
for
too
agile
a
movement
in
stepping
over
a
branch
that
lay
in
the
path.
"But
when
I
think
about
myself,
and
compare
myself
with
others,
especially
with
my
brother,
I
feel
I'm
a
poor
creature."
"But
in
what
way?"
Kitty
pursued
with
the
same
smile.
"Don't
you
too
work
for
others?
What
about
your
co-operative
settlement,
and
your
work
on
the
estate,
and
your
bookable
"Oh,
but
I
feel,
and
particularly
just
now-abandoned
your
fault,"
he
said,
pressing
her
hand-and-foot
all
that
doesn't
count.
I
do
it
in
a
way
halfhour
If
I
could
care
for
all
that
as
I
care
for
you"
Instead
of
that,
I
do
it
in
these
days
like
a
task
that
is
set
me."
"Well,
what
would
you
say
about
papacy

Looking

all
the

had
for

was
something
special
that
he
had
felt
long,
long

and
only
once,
in
his
early
youth.
The
feeling
of
happiness
in
being

continually
grew,
and
at

reached
such
a
point
that,

her

he
was
confused

and
smiled
to
her
in

a
smile
that
said
too
much.
"If
so,"
he
said
to

"I
ought
to
think
it
over

make

"Why

thing
I

I

to

that

said
to
himself,
feeling
at
the
same
time
that
this
consideration
had
not
the
slightest
importance
for
him
personally,
but
would
only
perhaps
detract
from
his
romantic
character
in
the
eyes
of
others.
"But
apart
from
that,
however
much
I
searched,
I
should
never
find
anything
to
say
against

If
I

I

Another

she
was

had
an

instead

some

old
princess.
That
evening
they
were
expecting
Stepan
Arkalyk
to
come
down
by
train,
and
the
old
prince
had
written
that
possibly
he
might
come
too.
"And
I
know
why,"
the
princess
went
on;
"he
says
that
young
people
ought
to
be
left
alone
for
a
while
at
first."
"But
papa
has
left
us
alone.
We've
never
seen
him,"
said
Kitty.
"Besides,
we're
not
young
people"
old,
married
people
by
now."
"Only
if
he
doesn't
come,
I
shall
say
good-bye
to
you
children,"
said
the
princess,
sighing
mournfully.
"What
nonsense,
mammal
both
the
daughters
fell
upon
her
at
once.
"How
do
you
suppose
he
is
feeling?
Why,
now:
And
suddenly
there
was
an
unexpected
quiver
in
the
princess,
voice.
Her
daughters
were
silent,
and
looked
at
one
another.
"Man
always
finds
something
to
be
miserable
about,"
they
said
in
that
glance.
They
did
not
know
that
happy
as
the
princess
was
in
her
daughter's
house,
and
useful
as
she
felt
herself
to
be
there,
she
had
been
extremely
miserable,
both
on
her
own
account
and
her
husband's,
ever
since
they
had
married
their
last
and
favorite
daughter,
and
the
old
home
had
been
left
empty.
"What
is
it,
Agag
Mihalowski
Kitty
asked
suddenly
of
Agag
Mihalowski
who
was
standing
with
a
mysterious
air,
and
a
face
full
of
meaning.
"About
supper.'
"Well,
that's
right,"
said
Dollywood
"you
go
and
arrange
about
it,
and
I'll
go
and
hear
Grisham
repeat
his
lesson,
or
else
he
will
have
nothing
done
all
day."
"That's
my
lesson,
No,
Dolly,
I'm
going,"
said
Levin,
jumping
up.
Grisham
who
was
by
now
at
a
high
school,
had
to
go
over
the
lessons
of
the
term
in
the
summer
holidays.
Darya
Alexei
who
had
been
studying
Latin
with
her
son
in
Moscow
before,
had
made
it
a
rule
on
coming
to
the
Levins,
to
go
over
with
him,
at
least
once
a
day,
the
most
difficult
lessons
of
Latin
and
arithmetic.
Levin
had
offered
to
take
her
place,
but
the
mother,
having
once
overheard
Levin's
lesson,
and
noticing
that
it
was
not
given
exactly
as
the
teacher
in
Moscow
had
given
it,
said
resolutely."
though
with
much
embarrassment
and
anxiety
not
to
mortis."
Levin,
that
they
must
keep
strictly
to
the
book
as
the
teacher
had
done,
and
that
she
had
better
undertake
it
again
herself.
Levin
was
amazed
both
at
Stepan
Arkalyk
who,
by
neglecting
his
duty,
threw
upon
the
mother
the
supervision
of
studies
of
which
she
had
no
comprehension,"
and
at
the
teachers
for
teaching
the
children
so
badly.
But
he
promised
his
sister-in-law
to
give
the
lessons
exactly
as
she
wished.
And
he
went
on
teaching
Grisham
not
in
his
own
way,
but
by
the
book,
and
so
took
little
interest
in
it,
and
often
forgot
the
hour
of
the
lesson.
So
it
had
been
today.
"No,
I'm
going,
Dolly,
you
sit
still,"
he
said.
"We'll
do
it
all
properly,
like
the
book.
Only
when
Stivaletti
comes,
and
we
go
out
shooting,
then
we
shall
have
to
miss
it."
And
Levin
went
to
Grisham
Varese
was
saying
the
same
thing
to
Kitty.
Even
in
the
happy,
well-ordered
household
of
the
Levins
Varese
had
succeeded
in
making
herself
useful.
"I'll
see
to
the
supper,
you
sit
still,"
she
said,
and
got
up
to
go
to
Agag
Mihalowski
"Yes,
yes,
most
likely
they've
not
been
able
to
get
chickens.
If
so,
ours:
"Again,
Mihalowski
and
I
will
see
about
it,"
and
Varese
vanished
with
her.
"What
a
nice
girl"
said
the
princess.
"Not
nice,
mamas
she's
an
exquisite
girl;
there's
no
one
else
like
her."
"So
you
are
expecting
Stepan
Arkalyk
today?"
said
Sergey
Ivanovo.
evidently
not
disposed
to
pursue
the
conversation
about
Varese
"It
would
be
difficult
to
find
two
sons-in-law
more
unlike
than
yours,"
he
said
with
a
subtle
smile.
"One
all
movement,
only
living
in
society,
like
a
fish
in
water;
the
other
our
Kostyra,
lively,
alert,
quick
in
everything,
but
as
soon
as
he
is
in
society,
he
either
sinks
into
apathy,
or
struggles
helplessly
like
a
fish
on
land."
"Yes,
he's
very
heedlessly
said
the
princess,
addressing
Sergey
Ivanovo.
"I've
been
meaning,
indeed,
to
ask
you
to
tell
him
that
it's
out
of
the
question
for
her"
(she
indicated
Kitty,
"to
stay
here;
that
she
positively
must
come
to
Moscow.
He
talks
of
getting
a
doctor
down:
"Man
he'll
do
everything;
he
has
agreed
to
everything,"
Kitty
said,
angry
with
her
mother
for
appealing
to
Sergey
Ivanovo.
to
judge
in
such
a
matter.
In
the
middle
of
their
conversation
they
heard
the
snorting
of
horses
and
the
sound
of
wheels
on
the
gravel.
Dolly
had
not
time
to
get
up
to
go
and
meet
her
husband,
when
from
the
window
of
the
room
below,
where
Grisham
was
having
his
lesson,
Levin
leaped
out
and
helped
Grisham
out
after
him.
"It's
Stivaletti
Levin
shouted
from
under
the
balcony.
"We've
finished,
Dolly,
don't
be
afraid"
he
added,
and
started
running
like
a
boy
to
meet
the
carriage.
"`A
eacefully
id.
eke
eke
eke
shouted
Grisham
skipping
along
the
avenue.
"And
some
one
else
too!
Papa,
of
course"
cried
Levin,
stopping
at
the
entrance
of
the
avenue.
"Klansas
don't
come
down
the
steep
staircase,
go
round."
But
Levin
had
been
mistaken
in
taking
the
person
sitting
in
the
carriage
for
the
old
prince.
As
he
got
nearer
to
the
carriage
he
saw
beside
Stepan
Arkalyk
not
the
prince
but
a
handsome,
stout
young
man
in
a
Scotch
cap,
with
long
ends
of
ribbon
behind.
This
was
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
a
distant
cousin
of
the
Shtern
a
brilliant
young
gentleman
in
Petersburg
and
Moscow
society.
"A
capital
fellow,
and
a
keen
sportsman.
as
Stepan
Arkalyk
said,
introducing
him.
Not
a
whit
abashed
by
the
disappointment
caused
by
his
having
come
in
place
of
the
old
prince,
VetFran,
greeted
Levin
gain
claiming
acquaintance
with
him
in
the
past,
and
snatching
up
Grisham
into
the
carriage,
lifted
him
over
the
pointer
that
Stepan
Arkalyk
had
brought
with
him.
Levin
did
not
get
into
the
carriage,
but
walked
behind.
He
was
rather
vexed
at
the
non-aspirin
of
the
old
prince,
whom
he
liked
more
and
more
the
more
he
saw
of
him,
and
also
at
the
arrival
of
this
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
a
quite
uncongenial
and
superfluous
person.
He
seemed
to
him
still
more
uncongenial
and
superfluous
when,
on
approaching
the
steps
where
the
whole
party,
children
and
grown-up,
were
gathered
together
in
much
excitement,
Levin
saw
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
with
a
particularly
warm
and
gallant
air,
kissing
Kitty,
hand.
"Your
wife
and
I
are
cousins
and
very
old
friends,"
said
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
once
more
shaking
Levin's
hand
with
great
warmth.
"Well,
are
there
plenty
of
birdseed
Stepan
Arkalyk
said
to
Levin,
hardly
leaving
time
for
everyone
to
utter
their
greetings.
"We've
come
with
the
most
savage
intentions.
Why,
mamas
they've
not
been
in
Moscow
since'.'
Look,
Tanya,
here's
something
for
you!
Get
it,
please,
it's
in
the
carriage,
behind"
he
talked
in
all
directions.
"How
pretty
you've
grown,
Dolly,"
he
said
to
his
wife,
once
more
kissing
her
hand,
holding
it
in
one
of
his,
and
patting
it
with
the
other.
Levin,
who
a
minute
before
had
been
in
the
happiest
frame
of
mind,
now
looked
darkly
at
everyone,
and
everything
displeased
him.
"Who
was
it
he
kissed
yesterday
with
those
lips?"'
he
thought,
looking
at
Stepan
Arkalyk
tender
demonstrations
to
his
wife.
He
looked
at
Dolly,
and
he
did
not
like
her
either.
"She
doesn't
believe
in
his
love.
So
what
is
she
so
pleased
about?
Revolucije,
thought
Levin.
He
looked
at
the
princess,
who
had
been
so
dear
to
him
a
minute
before,
and
he
did
not
like
the
manner
in
which
she
welcomed
this
Vassilatos,
with
his
ribbons,
just
as
though
she
were
in
her
own
house.
Even
Sergey
Ivanovo.
who
had
come
out
too
onto
the
steps,
seemed
to
him
unpleasant
with
the
show
of
cordiality
with
which
he
met
Stepan
Arkalyk
though
Levin
knew
that
his
brother
neither
liked
nor
respected

And
Varese

_security,
nitpicking,"
making
the
acquaintance
of
this
gentleman,
while
all
the
while
she
was
thinking
of
nothing
but
getting
married.
And
more
hateful
than
anyone
was
Kitty
for
falling
in
with
the
tone
of
gaiety
with
which
this
gentleman
regarded
his
visit
in
the
country,
as
though
it
were
a
holiday
for
himself
and
everyone
else.
And,
above
all,
unpleasant
was
that
particular
smile
with
which
she
responded
to
his
smile.
Noisin,
talking,
they
all
went
into
the
house;
but
as
soon
as
they
were
all
seated,
Levin
turned
and
went
out.
Kitty
saw
something
was
wrong
with
her
husband.
She
tried
to
seize
a
moment
to
speak
to
him
alone,
but
he
made
haste
to
get
away
from
her,
saying
he
was
wanted
at
the
counting.
It
was
long
since
his
own
work
on
the
estate
had
seemed
to
him
so
important
as
at
that
moment.
"It's
all
holiday
for
them,"
he
thought;
"but
these
are
no
holiday
matters,
they
won't
wait,
and
there's
no
living
without
them."
Chapter
7
Levin
came
back
to
the
house
only
when
they
sent
to
summon
him
to
supper.
On
the
stairs
were
standing
Kitty
and
Agag
Mihalowski
consulting
about
wines
for
supper.
"But
why
are
you
making
all
this
fuss?
Have
what
we
usually
do."
"No,
Stivaletti
doesn't
drink
...
Kostyra,
stop,
what's
the
matter?"
Kitty
began,
hurrying
after
him,
but
he
strode
ruthlessly
away
to
the
dining
room
without
waiting
for
her,
and
at
once
joined
in
the
lively
general
conversation
which
was
being
maintained
there
by
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
"Well,
what
do
you
say,
are
we
going
shooting
tomorrow?"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
"Please,
do
let's
go,"
said
VetFran,
moving
to
another
chair,
where
he
sat
down
sideways,
with
one
fat
leg
crossed
under
him.
"I
shall
be
delighted,
we
will
go.
And
have
you
had
any
shooting
yet
this
year?"
said
Levin
to
VetFran,
looking
intently
at
his
leg,
but
speaking
with
that
forced
amiability
that
Kitty
knew
so
well
in
him,
and
that
was
so
out
of
keeping
with
him.
"I
can't
answer
for
our
finding
grouse,
but
there
are
plenty
of

Only
we
ought
to
start
early.
You're
not
tired?
Aren't
you
tired,
Stivaletti
"Me
tired?
I've
never
been
tired
yet.
Suppose
we
stay
up
all
night.
Let's
go
for
a
walk"
"Yes,
really,
let's
not
go
to
bed
at
all!"
Capital's
VetFran,
chimed
in.
"Oh,
we
all
know
you
can
do
without
sleep,
and
keep
other
people
up
too,"
Dolly
said
to
her
husband,
with
that
faint
note
of
irony
in
her
voice
which
she
almost
always
had
now
with
her
husband.
"But
to
my
thinking,
it's
time
for
bed
now:
I'm
going,
I
don't
want
supper.'
"No,
do
stay
a
little,
Dolly,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
going
round
to
her
side
behind
the
table
where
they
were
having
supper.
"I've
so
much
still
to
tell
you."
"Nothing
really,
I
suppose."
"Do
you
know
VetFran,
has
been
at
Anna,
and
he's
going
to
them
again?
You
know
they're
hardly
fifty
miles
from
you,
and
I
too
must
certainly
go
over
there.
VetFran,
come
here!"
Vassilatos,
crossed
over
to
the
ladies,
and
sat
down
beside
Kitty.
"Ah,
do
tell
me,
please;
you
have
stayed
with
her?
How
was
she?"
Darya
Alexei
appealed
to
him.
Levin
was
left
at
the
other
end
of
the
table,
and
though
never
pausing
in
his
conversation
with
the
princess
and
Varese
he
saw
that
there
was
an
eager
and
mysterious
conversation
going
on
between
Stepan
Arkalyk
Dolly,
Kitty,
and
VetFran,
And
that
was
not
all.
He
saw
on
his
wife's
face
an
expression
of
real
feeling
as
she
gazed
with
fixed
eyes
on
the
handsome
face
of
Vassilatos,
who
was
telling
them
something
with
great
animation.
"It's
exceedingly
nice
at
their
place,"
VetFran,
was
telling
them
about
Vrye
and
Anna.
"I
can't,
of
course,
take
it
upon
myself
to
judge,
but
in
their
house
you
feel
the
real
feeling
of
home."
"What
do
they
intend
doing?"
"I
believe
they
think
of
going
to
Moscow."
"How
jolly
it
would
be
for
us
all
to
go
over
to
them
together"
When
are
you
going
there?"
Stepan
Arkalyk
asked
Vassilatos,
"I'm
spending
July
there."
"Will
you
go?"
Stepan
Arkalyk
said
to
his
wife.
"I've
been
wanting
to
a
long
whiled
I
shall
certainly
go,"
said
Dolly.
"I
am
sorry
for
her,
and
I
know
her.
She's
a
splendid
woman.
I
will
go
alone,
when
you
go
back,
and
then
I
shall
be
in
no
one's
way.
And
it
will
be
better
indeed
without
you."
"To
be
sure,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
"And
you,
Kittyhawk
"IBM
Why
should
I
go?"
Kitty
said,
flushing
all
over,
and
she
glanced
round
at
her
husband.
"Do
you
know
Anna
Arkalyk
then?"
VetFran,
asked
her.
"She's
a
very
fascinating
woman."
"Yes,"
she
answered
VetFran,
cringe
still
more.
She
got
up
and
walked
across
to
her
husband.
"Are
you
going
shooting,
then,
tomorrow?"
she
said.
His
jealousy
had
in
these
few
moments,
especially
at
the
flush
that
had
overstaffed
her
cheeks
while
she
was
talking
to
VetFran,
gone
far
indeed.
Now
as
he
heard
her
words,
he
construed
them
in
his
own
fashion.
Strange
as
it
was
to
him
afterwards
to
recall
it,
it
seemed
to
him
at
the
moment
clear
that
in
asking
whether
he
was
going
shooting,
all
she
cared
to
know
was
whether
he
would
give
that
pleasure
to
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
with
whom,
as
he
fancier
she
was
in
love.
"Yes,
I'm
going,"
he
answered
her
in
an
unnatural
voice,
disagreeable
to
himself.
"No,
better
spend
the
day
here
tomorrow,
or
Dolly
won't
see
anything
of
her
husband,
and
set
off
the
day
after,"
said
Kitty.
The
motive
of
Kitty,
words
was
interpreted
by
Levin
thus:
"Don't
separate
me
from
_in
I
don't
care
about
`
going,
but
do
let
me
enjoy
the
society
of
this
delightful
young
man."
"Oh,
if
you
wish,
we'll
stay
here
tomorrow,"
Levin
answered,
with
peculiar
amiable
Vassilatos,
meanwhile,
utterly
unsuspecting
the
misery
his
presence
had
occasions
got
up
from
the
table
after
Kitty,
and
watching
her
with
smiling
and
admiring
eyes,
he
followed
her.
Levin
saw
that
look.
He
turned
white,
and
for
a
minute
he
could
hardly
breathe.
"How
dare
he
look
at
my
wife
like
that"
was
the
feeling
that
boiled
within
him.
"Tomorrow,
then?
Do,
please,
let
us
go,"
said
Vassilatos,
sitting
down
on
a
chair,
and
again
crossing
his
leg
as
his
habit
was.
Levin's
jealousy
went
further
still.
Already
he
saw
himself
a
deceived
husband,
looked
upon
by
his
wife
and
her
lover
as
simply
necessary
to
provide
them
with
the
conveniences
and
pleasures
of
life:
But
in
spite
of
that
he
made
polite
and
hospitable
inquiries
of
Vassilatos,
about
his
shooting,
his
gun,
and
his
boots,
and
agreed
to
go
shooting
next
day.
Happily
for
Levin,
the
old
princess
cut
short
his
agonies
by
getting
up
herself
and
advising
Kitty
to
go
to
bed.
But
even
at
this
point
Levin
could
not
escape
another
agony.
As
he
said
good-night
to
his
hostess,
Vassilatos,
would
again
have
kissed
her
hand,
but
Kitty,
reddening,
drew
back
her
hand
and
said
with
a
naive
bluntness,
for
which
the
old
princess
scolded
her
afterwards:
"We
don't
like
that
fashion."
In
Levin's
eyes
she
was
to
blame
for
having
allowed
such
relations
to
arise,
and
still
more
to
blame
for
showing
so
awkwardly
that
she
did
not
like
them.
"Why,
how
can
one
want
to
go
to
bed's
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
who,
after
drinking
several
glasses
of
wine
at
supper,
was
now
in
his
most
charming
and
sentimental
humor.
"Look,
Kitty.
he
said,
pointing
to
the
moon,
which
had
just
risen
behind
the
lime
trees.

Varvara
Andreevna
and
he
must
sing
some
duets;
When
the
party
had
broken
up,
Stepan
Arkalyk
walked
a
long
while
about
the
avenue
with
VetFran,
their
voices
could
be
heard
singing
one
of
the
new
songs.
Levin
hearing
these
voices
sat
scowling
in
an
easy-chair
in
his
wife's
bedroom,
and
maintained
an
obstinate
silence
when
she
asked
him
what
was
wrong.
But
when
at
last
with
a
timid
glance
she
hazardous
the
question:
"Was
there
perhaps
something
you
disliked
about
VetFran,
all
burst
out,
and
he
told
her
all.
He
was
humiliated
himself
at
what
he
was
saying,
and
that
exasperated
him
all
the
more.
He
stood
facing
her
with
his
eyes
glittering
menacingly
under
his
scowling
brows,
and
he
squeezed
his
strong
arms
across
his
chest,
as
though
he
were
straining
every
nerve
to
hold
himself
in.
The
expression
of
his
face
would
have
been
grim,
and
even
cruel,
if
it
had
not
at
the
same
time
had
a
look
of
suffering
which
touched
her.
His
jaws
were
twitching,
and
his
voice
kept
breaking.
"You
must
understand
that
I'm
not
jealous,
that's
a
nasty
word.
I
can't
be
jealous,
and
believe
that:
I
can't
say
what
I
feel,
but
this
is
null
I'm
not
jealous,
but
I'm
wounded,
humiliated
that
anybody
dare
think,
that
anybody
dare
look
at
you
with
eyes
like
that."
"Eyes
like
what?"
said
Kitty,
trying
as
conscientiously
as
possible
to
recall
every
word
and
gesture
of
that
evening
and
every
shade
implied
in
them.
At
the
very
bottom
of
her
heart
she
did
think
there
had
been
something
precisely
at
the
moment
when
he
had
crossed
over
after
her
to
the
other
end
of
the
table;
but
she
dared
not
own
it
even
to
herself,
and
would
have
been
even
more
unable
to
bring
herself
to
say
so
to
him,
and
so
increase
his
suffering.
"And
what
can
there
possibly
be
attractive
about
me
as
I
am
nowadays
"Ah,
he
cried,
clutching
at
his
head,
"you
shouldn't
say
that"
If
you
had
been
attractive
then:
"Oh,
no,
Kostyra,
oh,
wait
a
minute,
oh,
do
listen"
she
said,
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
of
pained
commiserative
"Why,
what
can
you
be
thinking
about!,"
When
for
me
there's
no
one
in
the
world,
no
one,
no
one"
Would
you
like
me
never
to
see
anyplace
For
the
first
minute
she
had
been
offended
at
his
jealousy;
she
was
angry
that
the
slightest
amusement,
even
the
most
innocent,
should
be
forbidden
her;
but
now
she
would
readily
have
sacrificed,
not
merely
such
trifling
but
everything,
for
his
peace
of
mind,
to
save
him
from
the
agony
he
was
suffering.
"You
must
understand
the
horror
and
comedy
of
my
position,"
he
went
on
in
a
desperate
whisper;
"that
he's
in
my
house,
that
he's
done
nothing
improper
positively
except
his
free
and
easy
airs
and
the
way
he
sits
on
his
legs.
He
thinks
it's
the
best
possible
form,
and
so
I'm
obliged
to
be
civil
to
him."
"But,
Kostyra,
you're
exaggerating,"
said
Kitty,
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
rejoicing
at
the
depth
of
his
love
for
her,
shown
now
in
his
jealousy.
"The
most
awful
part
of
it
all
is
that
you're
just
as

are,

"Well,

what?"
"I
saw
how
you
looked
while
we
were
talking
at
supper.'
"Well,
well!"
Levin
said
in
dismay.
She
told
him
what
they
had
been
talking
about.
And
as
she
told
him,
she
was
breathless
with
emotion.
Levin
was
silent
for
a
space,
then
he
scanned
her
pale
and
distressed
face,
and
suddenly
he
clutched
at
his
head.
"Katydids"
I've
been
worrying
you!
Darling,
forgive
me!
It's
madness"
Katya,

a
criminal.
And
how
could
you
be
so
distressed
at
such
idiom
"Oh,
I
was
sorry
for
you."
"For

for
me?

I
am"
But
why
make
you
miserable?
It's
awful
to
think
that
any
outsider
can
shatter
our
happiness."
"It's
humiliating
too,
of
course."
"Oh,
then
I'll
keep
him
here
all
the
summer,
and
will
overwhelm
him
with
civility,"
said
Levin,
kissing
her
hands.
"You
shall

Tomorrow:
Oh,
yes,
we
are
going
tomorrow."
Chapter
8
Next
day,
before
the
ladies
were
up,
the
wagons
and
a
trap
for
the
shooting
party
were
at
the
door,
and
Lasker
aware
since
early
morning
that
they
were
going
shooting,
after
much
whining
and
darting
to
and
fro,
had
sat
herself
down
in
the
wagons
beside
the
coachman,
and,
disapproving
of
the
delay,
was
excitedly
watching
the
door
from
which
the
sportsmen
still
did
not
come
out.
The
first
to
come
out
was
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
in
new
high
boots
that
reached
half-way
up
his
thick
thighs,
in
a
green
blouse,
with
a
new
Russian
leather
cartridge-tape
and
in
his
Scotch
cap
with
ribbons,
with
a
brand-new
English
gun
without
a
sling.
Lasker
flew
up
to
him,
welcomed
him,
and
jumping
up,
asked
him
in
her
own
way
whether
the
others
were
coming
soon,
but
getting
no
answer
from
him,
she
returned
to
her
post
of
observation
and
sank
into
repose
again,
her
head
on
one
side,
and
one
ear
pricked
up
to
listen.
At
last
the
door
opened
with
a
creak.
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
spot-buying
pointer
Krakatoa
flew
out,
running
round
and
round
and
turning
over
in
the
air.
Stepan
Arkalyk
himself
followed
with
a
gun
in
his
hand
and
a
cigar
in
his
mouth.
"Good
dog,
good
dog,
Krakatoa
he
cried
encouragingly
to
the
dog,
who
put
his
paws
up
on
his
chest,
catching
at
his
game
bag.
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
dressed
in
rough
leggings
and
spats.
in
torn
trousers
and
a
short
coat.
On
his
head
there
was
a
wreck
of
a
hat
of
indefinite
form,
but
his
gun
of
a
new
patent
was
a
perfect
gem,"
and
his
game
bag
and
cartridge
belt,
though
worn,
were
of
the
very
best
quality.
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
had
had
no
notion
before
that
it
was
truly
_especially
for
a
sportsman
to
be
in
tatters,
but
to
have
his
shooting
outfit
of
the
best
quality.
He
saw
it
now
as
he
looked
at
Stepan
Arkalyk
radiant
in
his
rags,
graceful,
well-fed,
and
joyous,
a
typical
Russian
nobleman.
And
he
made
up
his
mind
that
next
time
he
went
shooting
he
would
certainly
adopt
the
same
get-up.
"Well,
and
what
about
our
hosta
he
asked.
"A
young
wife,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
smiling.
"Yes,
and
such
a
charming
one!"
"He
came
down
dressed.
No
doubt
he's
run
up
to
her
again."
Stepan
Arkalyk
guessed
right.
Levin
had
run
up
again
to
his
wife
to
ask
her
once
more
if
she
forgave
him
for
his
idiocy,"
yesterday,
and,
moreover,
to
beg
her
for
Christ's
sake
to
be
more
careful.
The
great
thing
was
for
her
to
keep
away
from
the
children.
might
any
minute
push
against
her.
Then
he
had
once
more
to
hear
her
declare
that
she
was
not
angry
with
him
for
going
away
for
two
days,
and
to
beg
her
to
be
sure
to
send
him
a
note
next
morning
by
a
servant
on
horseback,
to
write
him,
if
it
were
but
two
words
only,
to
let
him
know
that
all
was
well
with
her.
Kitty
was
distressed,
as
she
always
was,
at
parting
for
a
couple
of
days
from
her
husband,
but
when
she
saw
his
eager
figure,
looking
big
and
strong
in
his
shooting-down
and
his
white
blouse,
and
a
sort
of
sportsman
elation
and
excitement
incomprehensible
to
her,
she
forgot
her
own
chagrin
for
the
sake
of
his
pleasure,
and
said
good-bye
to
him
cheerfully.
"Parent
gentlemen"
he
said,
running
out
onto
the
steps.
"Have
you
put
the
lunch
in?
Why
is
the
chestnut
on
the
right?
Well,
it
doesn't
matter.
Lasker
down;
go
and
lie
down!"
"Put
it
with
the
herd
of
oxen.
he
said
to
the
herdsmen
who
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
steps
with
some
question.
"Excuse
me,
here
comes
another
villain.'
Levin
jumped
out
of
the
wagons
in
which
he
had
already
taken
his
seat,
to
meet
the
carpenter,
who
came
towards
the
steps
with
a
rule
in
his
hand.
"You
didn't
come
to
the
counting
house
yesterday,
and
now
you're
detaining
me.
Well,
what
is
it?"
"Would
your
honor
let
me
make
another
turning?
It's
only
three
steps
to
add.
And
we
make
it
just
fit
at
the
same
time.
It
will
be
much
more
convenient."
"You
should
have
listened
to
me,"
Levin
answered
with
annoyance.
"I
said:
Put
the
lines
and
then
fit
in
the
steps.
Now
there's
no
setting
it
right.
Do
as
I
told
you,
and
make
a
new
staircase?
The
point
was
that
in
the
lodge
that
was
being
built
the
carpenter
had
spoiled
the
staircase,
fitting
it
together
without
calculating
the
space
it
was
to
fill,
so
that
the
steps
were
all
sloping
when
it
was
put
in
place.
Now
the
carpenter
wanted,
keeping
the
same
staircase,
to
add
three
steps.
"It
will
be
much
better."
"But
where's
your
staircase
coming
out
with
its
three
stepsister
"Why,
upon
my
word,
sir,"
the
carpenter
said
with
a
contemptuous
smile.
"It
comes
out
right
at
the
very
spot.
It
starts,
so
to
speak,"
he
said,
with
a
persuasive
gesture;
"it
comes
down,
and
comes
down,
and
comes
out."
"But
three
steps
will
add
to
the
length
too
...
where
is
it
to
come
out?"
"Why,
to
be
sure,
it'll
start
from
the
bottom
and
go
up
and
go
up,
and
come
out
so,"
the
carpenter
said
obstinately
and
convincingly.
"It'll
reach
the
ceiling
and
the
wall."
"Upon
my
word"
Why,
it'll
go
up,
and
up,
and
come
out
like
this."
Levin
took
out
a
ramrod
and
began
sketching
him
the
staircase
in
the
dust.
"There,
do
you
see?"
"As
your
honor
likes.
said
the
carpenter,
with
a
sudden
gleam
in
his
eyes,
obviously
understanding
the
thing
at
last.
"It
seems
it'll
be
best
to
make
a
new
one."
"Well,
then,
do
it
as
you're
told,"
Levin
shouted,
seating
himself
in
the
wagons
"Down,
Hold
the
dogs,
Philip,
Levin
felt
now
at
leaving
behind
all
his
family
and
household
cares
such
an
eager
sense
of
joy
in
life
and
expectation
that
he
was
not
disposed
to
talk.
Besides
that,
he
had
that
feeling
of
concentrated
excitement
that
every
sportsman
experiences
as
he
approaches
the
scene
of
action.
If
he
had
anything
on
his
mind
at
that
moment,
it
was
only
the
doubt
whether
they
would
start
anything
in
the
Kolsaas
marsh,
whether
Lasker
would
show
to
advantage
in
comparison
with
Krakatoa
and
whether
he
would
shoot
well
that
day
himself.
Not
to
disgrace
himself
before
a
new
spectator.
to
be
outdone
by
Obninsk's
too
was
a
thought
that
crossed
his
brain.
Obninsk's
was
feeling
the
same,
and
he
too
was
not
talkative.
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
kept
up
alone
a
ceaseless
flow
of
cheerful
chatter.
As
he
listened
to
him
now,
Levin
felt
ashamed
to
think
how
unfair
he
had
been
to
him
the
day
before.
Vassilatos,
was
really
a
nice
fellow,
simple,
good-hearted.
and
very
good-humoured
If
Levin
had
met
him
before
he
was
married,
he
would
have
made
friends
with
him.
Levin
rather
disliked
his
holiday
attitude
to
life
and
a
sort
of
free
and
easy
assumption
of
elegance.
It
was
as
though
he
assumed
a
high
degree
of
importance
in
himself
that
could
not
be
disputed,
because
he
had
long
nails
and
a
stylish
cap,
and
everything
else
to
corresponded
but
this
could
be
forgiven
for
the
sake
of
his
good
nature
and
good
breeding.
Levin
liked
him
for
his
good
education,
for
speaking
French
and
English
with
such
an
excellent
accent,
and
for
being
a
man
of
his
world.
Vassilatos,
was
extremely
delighted
with
the
left
horse,
a
horse
of
the
Don
Stepping
He
kept
praising
him
enthusiastically.
"How
fine
it
must
be
galloping
over
the
steppes
on
a
steppe
horse"
Ehart
isn't
it?"
he
said.
He
had
imagined
riding
on
a
steppe
horse
as
something
wild
and
romantic,
and
it
turned
out
nothing
of
the
sort.
But
his
simplicity,
particularly
in
conjunction
with
his
good
looks,
his
amiable
smile,
and
the
grace
of
his
movements,
was
very
attractive.
Either
because
his
nature
was
sympathetic
to
Levin,
or
because
Levin
was
trying
to
atone
for
his
sins
of
the
previous
evening
by
seeing
nothing
but
what
was
good
in
him,
anyway
he
liked
his
society.
After
they
had
driven
over
two
miles
from
home,
VetFran,
all
at
once
felt
for
a
cigar
and
his
pocketbook,
and
did
not
know
whether
he
had
lost
them
or
left
them
on
the
table.
In
the
pocketbook
there
were
thirty-seven
pounds,
and
so
the
matter
could
not
be
left
in
uncertainty.
"Do
you
know
what,
Levin,
I'll
gallop
home
on
that
left
trace.
That
will
be
splendid.

he
said,
preparing
to
get
out.
"No,

that

less
than

and
Levin

Levin
would
himself
have
liked
to
go
into
these
little
places,
but
they
were
near
home;
he
could
shoot
them
over

And

When
they
reached
a
little
marsh
Levin
would
have
driven
by,
but

eye
of

sportsman,
at

he
said,

to
the
little
marsh.

how
delightful,
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
began
begging,
and
Levin
could
but
consent.
Before
they
had
time
to
stop,
the
dogs
had
flown
one
before
the
other
into
the
marsh.
"Kramer
Lasker
The
dogs
came
back.
"There
won't
be
room
for

I'll
stay
here,"
said
Levin,
hoping
they
would
find
nothing
but
peform
who
had
been
startled
by
the
dogs,
and
turning
over
in
their
flight,
were
plaintively
wailing
over
the
marsh.
"No!
Come
along,
Levin,
let's
go
together"
VetFran,
called.
"Really,
there's
not
room.
Lasker

Lasker
You
won't
want
another
dog,
will
you?"
Levin
remained
with
the
wagons
and
looked
enviously
at
the
sportsmen.
They
walked
right
across
the
marsh.
Except
little
birds
and
peform
of
which
Vassilatos,
killed
one,
there
was
nothing
in
the
marsh.
"Come,
you
see
now
that
it
was

I

the

said
Levin,
"only
it's
wasting
time."
"Oh,
no,
it
was
jolly
all
the
same.
Did
you
see
us?"
said
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
clambering
awkwardly
into
the
wagons
with
his
gun
and
his
peform
in
his
hands.
"How
splendidly
I
shot
this
bird"
Didn't
I?
Well,
shall
we
soon
be
getting
to
the
real
place?"
The
horses
started
off
suddenly,
Levin
knocked
his
head
against
the
stock
of
someone's
gun,
and
there
was
the
report
of
a
shot.
The
gun
did
actually
go
off
first,
but
that
was
how
it
seemed
to
Levin.
It
appeared
that
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
had
pulled
only
one
trigger,
and
had
left
the
other
hammer
still
cockerel,
The
charge
flew
into
the
ground
without
doing
harm
to
anyone.
Stepan
Arkalyk
shook
his
head
and
laughed
reprsentative
at
VetFran,
But
Levin
had
not
the
heart
to
reproved
him.
In
the
first
place,
any
reproach
would
have
seemed
to
be
called
forth
by
the
danger
he
had
incurred
and
the
bump
that
had
come
up
on
Levin's
forehead.
And
besides,
VetFran,
was
at
first
so
naively
distressed,
and
then
laughed
so
good-humoured
and
infectiousness
at
their
general
dismay,
that
one
could
not
but
laugh
with
him.
When
they
reached
the
second
marsh,
which
was
fairly
large,
and
would
inevitably
take
some
time
to
shoot
over,
Levin
tried
to
persuade
them
to
pass
it
by.
But
VetFran,
again
overplay
him.
Again,
as
the
marsh
was
narrow,
Levin,
like
a
good
host,
remained
with
the
carriage.
Krakatoa
made
straight
for
some
clumps
of
sedges.
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
was
the
first
to
run
after
the
dog.
Before
Stepan
Arkalyk
had
time
to
come
up,
a
grouse
flew
out.
VetFran,
missed
it
and
it
flew
into
an
unmuffled
meadowlark
This
grouse
was
left
for
VetFran,
to
follow
up.
Krakatoa
found
it
again
and
pointed,
and
VetFran,
shot
it
and
went
back
to
the
carriage.
"Now
you
go
and
I'll
stay
with
the
horses,"
he
said.
Levin
had
begun
to
feel
the
pangs
of
a
sportsman's
envy.
He
handed
the
reins
to
VetFran,
and
walked
into
the
marsh.
Lasker
who
had
been
plaintively
whining
and
fretting
against
the
injustice
of
her
treatment,
flew
straight
ahead
to
a
hopeful
place
that
Levin
knew
well,
and
that
Krakatoa
had
not
yet
come
upon.
"Why
don't
you
stop
her?"
shouted
Stepan
Arkalyk
"She
won't
scare
them,"
answered
Levin,
sympathizing
with
his
bitch,
pleasure
and
hurrying
after
her.
As
she
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
familiar
breeding
places
there
was
more
and
more
earnestness
in
Lasker
exploration.
A
little
marsh
bird
did
not
divert
her
attention
for
more
than
an
instant.
She
made
one
circuit
round
the
clump
of
reeds,
was
beginning
a
second,
and
suddenly
quivered
with
excitement
and
became
motionless.
"Come,
come,
Stivaletti
shouted
Levin,
feeling
his
heart
beginning
to
beat
more
violet
and
all
of
a
sudden,
as
though
some
sort
of
shutter
had
been
drawn
back
from
his
straining
ears,
all
sounds,
confused
but
loud,
began
to
beat
on
his
hearing,
losing
all
sense
of
distance.
He
heard
the
steps
of
Stepan
Arkalyk
mistaking
them
for
the
tramp
of
the
horses
in
the
distance;
he
heard
the
brittle
sound
of
the
twigs
on
which
he
had
trophies
taking
this
sound
for
the
flying
of
a
groused
He
heard
too,
not
far
behind
him,
a
splashing
in
the
water,
which
he
could
not
explain
to
himself.
Picking
his
steps,
he
moved
up
to
the
dog.
"Feuersnot"
it!"
Not
a
grouse
but
a
snipe
flew
up
from
beside
the
dog.
Levin
had
lifted
his
gun,
but
at
the
very
instant
when
he
was
taking
aim,
the
sound
of
splashing
grew
louder,
came
closer,
and
was
joined
with
the
sound
of
VetFran,
voice,
shouting
something
with
strange
loudspeaker
Levin
saw
he
had
his
gun
pointed
behind
the
sniped
but
still
he
fired.
When
he
had
made
sure
he
had
missed,
Levin
looked
round
and
saw
the
horses
and
the
wagons
not
on
the
road
but
in
the
marsh.
VetFran,
eager
to
see
the
shooting,
had
driven
into
the
marsh,
and
got
the
horses
stuck
in
the
mud.
"Damn
the
fellow"
Levin
said
to
himself,
as
he
went
back
to
the
carriage
that
had
sunk
in
the
mire.
"What
did
you
drive
in
for?"
he
said
to
him
dryly,
and
calling
the
coachman,
he
began
pulling
the
horses
out.
Levin
was
vexed
both
at
being
hindered
from
shooting
and
at
his
horses
getting
stuck
in
the
mud,
and
still
more
at
the
fact
that
neither
Stepan
Arkalyk
nor
VetFran,
helped
him
and
the
coachman,
to
unhealthful
the
horses
and
get
them
out,
since
neither
of
them
had
the
slightest
notion
of

Without

that
it
had
been

there,
Levin
worked
in

with
the
coachman,
at
extricating
the
horses.
But
then,
as
he
got
warm
at
the
work
and
saw
how
assiduously
VetFran,
was
tugging
at
the
wagons
by
one
of
the
mud-hut
so
that
he
broke
it
indeed,
Levin
blamed
himself
for
having
under
the
influence
of
yesterday's
feelings
been
too
cold
to
VetFran,
and
tried
to
be
particularly
genial
so
as
to
smooth
over

When
everything
had
been
put
right,
and
the
carriage
had
been
brought
back
to

road,
Levin
had
the
lunch
served.

Vassilatos,
who
had
recovered
his
spirits,
quoted
the
French
saying
as
he
finished
his
second
chicken.
"Well,
now
our
troubles
are
over,
now
everything's
going
to
go
well.
Only,

he
answered,
not

to
let

drive.
"No,
I
must

I'm

he
drove.
Levin
was
a
little
afraid
he
would
exhaust
the
horses,
especially
the
chestnut,
whom
he
did
not
know
how
to
hold
in;
but
unconsciously
he
fell
under
the
influence

his
gaiety

listened
to
the
songs

sang

gave

Vassilatos,
drove
the
horses
so
smartly
that
they
reached
the
marsh
too
early,
while
it
was
still
hot.
As
they
drew
near
this
more
important
marsh,
the
chief
aim
of
their
expedition,
Levin
could
not
help
considering
how
he
could
get
rid
of
Vassilatos,
and
be
free
in
his
movements.
Stepan

evidently
had
the

Levin

to
two
great
birds
hovering
over
the
reeds.
"Where
there
are

there
is
sure
to

"Now,
gentlemen,"
said
Levin,

up
his
boots
and
examining
the
lock
of
his
gun
with
rather
a
gloomy
expression,

pointed

stretched
along
the

of
the

Vassilatos,
exclaimed.
Levin
could
do
nothing
but
agree,
and
they
divided.
As
soon
as
they
entered
the
marsh,
the
two
dogs
began
hunting
about
together
and
made
towards

he
said
in
a
faint
voice
to
his

in

him.
Levin
could
not
help
feeling
an
interest
in
the
direction
his
gun
was
pointed,
after
that
casual
shot
near
the
Kolsaas

"Oh,

But
Levin
could
not

and
recalled

The

came

each

pursuing
its
own
scent.
The
expectation
of
snipe
was
so
intense
that
to
Levin
the
squelching
sound
of
his
own

as
he
drew
it
up
out
of
the
mire,
seemed
to
be
the
call
of
a
sniped
and
he
clutched
and
pressed
the
lock
of
his
gun.
"Bangladesh
bang"
sounded
almost
in
his
ear.
Vassilatos,
had
fired
at
a
flock
of
ducks
which
was
hovering
over
the
marsh
and
flying
at
that
moment
towards
the
sportsmen,
far
out
of
range.
Before
Levin
had
time
to
look
round,
there
was
the
whir
of
one
sniped
another,
a
third,
and
some
eight
more
rose
one
after
another.
Stepan
Arkalyk
hit
one
at
the
very
moment
when
it
was
beginning
its
zigzag
movements,
and
the
snipe
fell
in
a
heap
into
the
mud.
Obninsk's
aimed
deliberately
at
another,
still
flying
low
in
the
reeds,
and
together
with
the
report
of
the
shot,
that
snipe
too
fell,
and
it
could
be
seen
fluttering
out
where
the
sedge
had
been
cut,
its
unhurt
wing
showing
white
beneath.
Levin
was
not
so
lucky:
he
aimed
at
his
first
bird
too
low,
and
missed?
he
aimed
at
it
again,
just
as
it
was
rising,
but
at
that
instant
another
snipe
flew
up
at
his
very
feet,
distracting
him
so
that
he
missed
again.
While
they
were
loading
their
guns,
another
snipe
rose,
and
VetFran,
who
had
had
time
to
load
again,
sent
two
charges
of
small-size
into
the
water.
Stepan
Arkalyk
picked
up
his
sniped
and
with
sparkling
eyes
looked
at
Levin.
"Well,
now
let
us
separate,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
and
limping
on
his
left
foot,
holding
his
gun
in
readiness
and
whistling
to
his
dog,
he
walked
off
in
one
direction.
Levin
and
VetFran,
walked
in
the
other.
It
always
happened
with
Levin
that
when
his
first
shots
were
a
failure
he
got
hot
and
out
of
temper,
and
shot
badly
the
whole
day.
So
it
was
that
day.
The
snipe
showed
themselves
in
numbers.
They
kept
flying
up
from
just
under
the
dogs,
from
under
the
sportsmen's
legs,
and
Levin
might
have
retrieved
his
ill
luck.
But
the
more
he
shot,
the
more
he
felt
disgraced
in
the
eyes
of
VetFran,
who
kept
popping
away
merrily
and
indiscriminately,
killing
nothing,
and
not
in
the
slightest
abashed
by
his
ill
success.
Levin,
in
feverish
haste,
could
not
restrain
himself,
got
more
and
more
out
of
temper,
and
ended
by
shooting
almost
without
a
hope
of
hitting.
Lasker
indeed,
seemed
to
understand
this.
She
began
looking
more
languish
and
gazed
back
at
the
sportsmen,
as
it
were,
with
perplexity
or
reproach
in
her
eyes.
Shots
followed
shots
in
rapid
succession.
The
smoke
of
the
powder
hung
about
the
sportsmen,
while
in
the
great
roomy
net
of
the
game
bag
there
were
only
three
light
little
sniped
And
of
these
one
had
been
killed
by
VetFran,
alone,
and
one
by
both
of
them
together.
Meanwhile
from
the
other
side
of
the
marsh
came
the

of

still
more.
The

floating
continually

the

Their

close
to
the

and
their

settled
again
before
the
sportsmen.

there
were
now
dozens
of
them
hovering
with
shrill
cries
over
the
marsh.

his
companion
through
the
cut
and
uncut

"come

Levin
looked

it's
all
right"
shouted
a
good-humoured
bearded
peasant
with
a
red
face,
showing
his
white
teeth
in
a
grin,
and
holding
up
a
greenish
bottle
that
flashed
in
the
sunlight.
"`A

asked
VetFran,
"They
invite
you
to
have
some
vodka.
Most
likely
they've
been
dividing
the
meadow
into
lots.
I
should
have
some,"
said
Levin,
not
without
some
guile,
hoping
VetFran,
would
be
tempted
by
the
vodka,
and
would
go
away
to
them.
"Why
do
they
offer
it?"
"Oh,
they're
merry-merry."
Really,
you
should
join
them.
You
would
be
interested."
"`A

"You
go,
you
go,
you'll
find
the
way
to
the

cried
Levin,
and
looking
round
he
perceived
with
satisfaction
that
VetFran,
bent
and
stumbling
with
wearing
holding
his
gun
out
at
arm's
length,
was
making
his
way
out
of
the
marsh
towards
the
peasants.
"You
come
too"
the
peasants
shouted
to
Levin.
"Never
fear"
You
taste
our
cake,
Levin
felt
a
strong
inclination
to
drink
a
little
vodka
and
to
eat
some
bread.
He
was
exhausted,
and
felt
it
a
great
effort
to
drag
his
staggering
legs
out
of
the
mire,
and
for
a
minute
he
hesitated.
But
Lasker
was
setting.
And
immediately
all
his
weariness
vanished,
and
he
walked
lightly
through
the
swamp
towards
the
dog.
A
snipe
flew
up
at
his
feet;
he
fired
and
killed
it.
Lasker
still
pointedly
it!"
Another
bird
flew
up
close
to
the
dog.
Levin
fired.
But
it
was
an
unlucky
day
for
him;
he
missed
it,
and
when
he
went
to
look
for
the
one
he
had
shot,
he
could
not
find
that
either.
He
wandered
all
about
the
reeds,
but
Lasker
did
not
believe
he
had
shot
it,
and
when
he
sent
her
to
find
it,
she
pretended
to
hunt
for
it,
but
did
not
really.
And
in
the
absence
of
Vassilatos,
on
whom
Levin
threw
the
blame
of
his
failure,
things
went
no
better.
There
were
plenty
of
snipe
still,
but
Levin
made
one
miss
after
another.
The
slanting
rays
of
the
sun
were
still
hot?"
his
clothes,
soaked
through
with
perspiration,
stuck
to
his
body;
his
left
boot
full
of
water
weighed
heavily
on
his
leg
and
squeaked
at
every
step;
the
sweat
ran
in
drops
down
his
powder.
face,
his
mouth
was
full
of
the
bitter
taste,
his
nose
of
the
smell
of
powder
and
stagnant
water,
his
ears
were
ringing
with
the
incessant
whir
of
the
sniped
he
could
not
touch
the
stock
of
his
gun,
it
was
so
hot?"
his
heart
beat
with
short,
rapid
throes
his
hands
shook
with
excitement,
and
his
weary
legs
stumbled
and
staggered
over
the
hillocks,
and
in
the
swamp,
but
still
he
walked
on
and
still
he
shot.
At
last,
after
a
disgraceful
miss,
he
flung
his
gun
and
his
hat
on
the
ground.
"No,
I
must
control
myself,"
he
said
to
himself.
Picking
up
his
gun
and
his
hat,
he
called
Lasker
and
went
out
of
the
swamp.
When
he
got
on
to
dry
ground
he
sat
down,
pulled
off
his
boot
and
emptied
it,
then
walked
to
the
marsh,
drank
some
stagnant.
water,
moistened
his
burning
hot
gun,
and
washed
his
face
and
hands.
Feeling
refreshed,"
he
went
back
to
the
spot
where
a
snipe
had
settled,
firmly
resolved
to
keep
cool.
He
tried
to
be
calm,
but
it
was
the
same
again.
His
finger
pressed
the
cock
before
he
had
taken
a
good
aim
at
the
bird.
It
got
worse
and
worse.
He
had
only
five
birds
in
his
game-breaking
when
he
walked
out
of
the
marsh
towards
the
aldicarb
where
he
was
to
rejoin
Stepan
Arkalyk
Before
he
caught
sight
of
Stepan
Arkalyk
he
saw
his
dog.

from

to

in

"Wellcome

he
said,

have

queried
Levin.
But
there
was
no

to

for

"Oh,

fair."
He
had

said
Stepan

to
soften
his
triumph.
Chapter
11
When
Levin
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
reached
the
peasant's
hut
where
Levin
always
used
to
stay,
VetFran,
was
already
there.
He
was
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
hut,
clinging
with
both
hands
to
the
bench
from
which
he
was
being
pulled
by
a
soldier,
the
brother
of
the
peasant's
wife,
who
was
helping
him
off
with
his
mis-assessment
boots.
VetFran,
was
laughing
his
infectious,
good-humored
laugh.
"I've
only
just
come.
_Immediately

And
they
would
not
take
a

And
they
kept
saying:
'Excuse

said
the
soldier,
succeeding
at
last
in
pulling
the
soaked
boot
off
the
blackened
stocking.
In
spite
of
the
dirty
of
the
hut,
which
was
all
muddied
by
their
boots
and
the
filthy

licking
themselves
clean,
and
the
smell
of

and

that
filled
the
room,
and
the
absence
of

and
forks,
the
party
drank
their

and
ate
their
supper
with
a
relish
only
known
to
sportsmen.

went

ready
for
them,
where
the
coachman,
had
been
making
up
beds
for
the
gentlemen.
Though
it
was
dusk,
not
one
of
them
wanted
to
go
to
sleep.
After
wavering
among
reminiscences
and
anecdotes
of
guns,
of
dogs,
and
of
former
shooting
parties,
the
conversation
rested
on
a
topic
that
interested
all
of
them.
After
Vassilatos,
had
several
times
over
expressed
his
appreciation
of
this
delightful
sleeping
place
among
the
fragrant
hay,
this
delightful
broken
cart
(he
supposed
it
to
be
broken
because
the
shafts
had
been
taken
out).
of
the
good
nature
of
the
peasants
that
had
treated
him
to
vodka,
of
the
dogs
who
lay
at
the
feet
of
their
respective
masters,
Obninsk's
began
telling
them
of
a
delightful
shooting
party
at
Malthusian
where
he
had
stayed
the
previous
summer.
Malthus
was
a
well-known
capitalist,
who
had
made
his
money
by
speculation
in
railway
shares.
Stepan
Arkalyk
described
what
grouse
moors
this
Malthus
had
bought
in
the
Tver
province,
and
how
they
were
preserved,
and
of
the
carriages
and
dogcatcher
in
which
the
shooting
party
had
been
driven,
and
the
luncheon
pavilion
that
had
been
rigged
up
at
the
marsh.
"I
don't
understand
you,"
said
Levin,
sitting
up
in
the
haying
"how
is
it
such
people
don't
disgust
you?
I
can
understand
a
lunch
with
Lafitte
is
all
very
pleasant,
but
don't
you
dislike
just
that

All

in

days,

their
money
in
a
way
that
gains
them
the
contempt
of
everyone.
They
don't
care
for
their
contempt,
and
then
they
use
their
dishonest
gains
to
buy
off
the
contempt
they
have
deserved?
"Perfectly

chimed
in
Vassilatos,
VetFran,

but

people
say:
'Well,

with
them.)
"Not
a
bit
of
it."
Levin
could
hear
that
Obninsk's
was
smiling
as
he
spoke.
"I
simply
don't
consider
him
more
dishonest
than
any
other
wealthy
merchant
or
nobleman.
They've
all
made
their
money
alike.

work
and
their
intelligence."
"Oh,
by
what
work?
Do
you
call
it
work
to
get
hold
of
concessions
and
speculate
with
them?"
"Of
course
it's
work.
Work
in
this
sense,
that
if
it
were
not
for
him
and
others
like
him,
there
would
have
been

"But
that's
not
work,
like
the
work
of

or
a

profession."
"Grape

it's

the
sense

But
of
course
you
think

useless."
"No,
that's
another
question;
I
am
prepared
to
admit
that
they're
useful.
But
all

that
is
out

"But

said
Levin,
conscious
that
he
could
not
draw
a
distinct
line
between
honesty
and
dishonesty.
"Such
as

for
instance,"
he
went
on.
"It's

Stepan
Arkalyk
called
to
his
dog,
who
was
scratching
and
turning
over
all
the
hay.
He
was
obviously
convinced
of
the
correctness
of
his
position,
and
so
talked
serenely
and
without
haste.
"But
you
have
not
drawn
the
line
between
honest
and

say,

our
host,
the

hard
he
works,
can
never
get
more
than
fifty
roubles,
is
just
as
dishonest
as

than
my

and
Malthus

more
than

No,
quite
the
contrary;
I
see
that
society
takes
up
a
sort
of
antagonistic
attitude
to
these
people,
which
is
utterly
baseless,
and
I
fancy
there's
envy
at
the
bottom
of
it:
"No,
that's
unfair,"
said
VetFran,
"how
could
envy
come
in?
There
is
something
not
nice
about
that
sort
of
business."
"You
say,"
Levin
went
on,
"that
it's
unjust
for
me
to
receive
five
thousand,
while
the
peasant
has
fiftyfold,"
that's
true.
It
is
unfair,
and
I
feel
it,
but:
"It
really
is.
Why
is
it
we
spend
our
time
riding,
drinking,
shooting,
doing
nothing,
while
they
are
forever
at
work?"
said
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
obviously
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
reflecting
on
the
question,
and
consequently
considering
it
with
perfect
sincerity.
"Yes,
you
feel
it,
but
you
don't
give
him
your
property,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
intentionally,
as
it
seemed,
provoking
Levin.
There
had
arisen
of
late
something
like
a
secret
antagonism
between
the
two
brothers.
as
though,
since
they
had
married
sisters,
a
kind
of
rivalry
had
sprung
up
between
them
as
to
which
was
ordering
his
life
best,
and
now
this
hostility
showed
itself
in
the
conversation,
as
it
began
to
take
a
personal
note.
"I
don't
give
it
away,
because
no
one
demands
that
from
me,
and
if
I
wanted
to,
I
could
not
give
it
away,"
answered
Levin,
"and
have
no
one
to
give
it
to."
"Give
it
to
this
peasant,
he
would
not
refuse
it."
"Yes,
but
how
am
I
to
give
it
up?
Am
I
to
go
to
him
and
make
a
deed
of
conveyances
"I
don't
know;
but
if
you
are
convinced
that
you
have
no
right:
"I'm
not
at
all
convinced.
On
the
contrary,
I
feel
I
have
no
right
to
give
it
up,
that
I
have
duties
both
to
the
land
and
to
my
family."
"No,
excuse
me,
but
if
you
consider
this
inequality
is
unjust,
why
is
it
you
don't
act
accordion
"Well,
I
do
act
negatively
on
that
idea,
so
far
as
not
trying
to
increase
the
difference
of
position
existing
between
him
and
me."
"No,
excuse
me,
that's
a
paradox:
"Yes,
there's
something
of
a
sophomore
about
that,"
VetFran,
agreed.
"Ah!
our
hosta
so
you're
not
asleep
yet?"
he
said
to
the
peasant
who
came
into
the
barn,
opening
the
creaking
door.
"How
is
it
you're
not
asleep?"
"No,
how's
one
to
sleep"
I
thought
our
gentlemen
would
be
asleep,
but
I
heard
them

I
want
to
get
a
hook
from
here.
She
won't

he
added,
stepping
cautiously
with
his
bare
feet.
"And
where
are
you
going
to
sleeped
"We
are
going
out
for
the
night
with
the
beat
"Ah,
what
a
night!"
said
VetFran,
looking
out
at
the
edge
of
the
hut
and
the
unhealthful
wagons
that
could
be
seen
in
the
faint
light
of
the
evening
glow
in
the
great
frame
of
the
open
doors.
"But
listen,
there
are
women's
voices
singing,
and,
on
my
word,
not
badly
too.
Who's
that
singing,
my
friend?"
"That's
the
maids
from
hard
by
here."
"Let's
go,
let's
have
a
walk"
We
shan't
go
to
sleep,
you
know.
Obninsk's
come
along"
"If
one
could
only
do
both,
lie
here
and
go,"
answered
Obninsk's
stretching.
"It's
capital
lying
here."
"Well,
I
shall
go
by
myself,"
said
VetFran,
getting
up
eagerly,
and
putting
on
his
shoes
and
stockings.
"Good-morning
gentlemen.
If
it's
fun,
I'll
fetch
you.
You've
treated
me
to
some
good
sport,
and
I
won't
forget
you."
"He
really
is
a
capital
fellow,
isn't
he?"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
when
VetFran,
had
gone
out
and
the
peasant
had
closed
the
door
after
him.
"Yes,
capital,"
answered
Levin,
still
thinking
of
the
subject
of
their
conversation
just
before.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
clearly
expressed
his
thoughts
and
feelings
to
the
best
of
his
capacity,
and
yet
both
of
them,
straightforward
men
and
not
fools,
had
said
with
one
voice
that
he
was
comforting
himself
with
sophomore
This
disconcerted
him.
"It's
just
this,
my
dear
boy.
One
must
do
one
of
two
things:
either
admit
that
the
existing
order
of
society
is
just,
and
then
stick
up
for
one's
rights
in
it;
or
acknowledge
that
you
are
enjoying
unjust
privileges,
as
I
do,
and
then
enjoy
them
and
be
satisfied."
"No,
if
it
were
unjust,
you
could
not
enjoy
these
advantages
and
be
satisfied.
least
I
could
not.
The
great
thing
for
me
is
to
feel
that
I'm
not
to
blame."
"What
do
you
say,
why
not
go
after
all?"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
evidently
weary
of
the
strain
of
thought.
"We
shan't
go
to
sleep,
you
know.
Come,
let's
go!"
Levin
did
not
answer.
What
they
had
said
in
the
conversation,
that
he
acted
justly
only
in
a
negative
sense,
absorbed
his
thoughts.
"Can
it
be
that
it's
only
possible
to
be
just
negatives
he
was
asking
himself.
"How
strong
the
smell
of
the
fresh
hay
is,
though,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
getting
up.
"There's
not
a
chance
of
sleeping.
Vassilatos,

been
getting
up
some
fun
there.
Do
you
hear
the
laughing
and
his
voice?
Hadn't
we
better
go?
Come
along"
"No,
I'm
not
coming,"
answered
Levin.
"Surely
that's
not
a
matter
of
principle
too,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
smiling,
as
he
felt
about
in
the
dark
for
his
cap.
"It's
not
a
matter
of
principle,
but
why
should
I
go?"
"But
do
you
know
you
are
preparing
trouble
for
yourself,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
finding
his
cap
and
getting
up.
"How
so?"
"Do
you
suppose
I
don't
see
the
line
you've
taken
up
with
your
wife?
I
heard
how
it's
a
question
of
the
greatest
consequence,
whether
or
not
you're
to
be
away
for
a
couple
of
days'
shooting.
That's
all
very
well
as
an
idyllic
episode,
but
for
your
whole
life
that
won't
answer.
A
man
must
be
independent;
he
has
his
masculine
interests.
A
man
has
to
be
mat
said
Obninsk's
opening
the
door.
"In
what
way?
To
go
running
after
servant
girls?"
said
Levin.
"Why
not,
if
it
amuses
him?
_California,

It
won't
do
my
wife
any
harm,
and
it'll
amuse
me.
The
great
thing
is
to
respect
the
sanctity
of
the
home.
There
should
be
nothing
in
the
home.
But
don't
tie
your
own
hands."
"Perhaps
so,"
said
Levin
dryly,
and
he
turned
on
his
side.
"Tomorrow,
early,
I
want
to
go
shooting,
and
I
won't
wake
anyone,
and
shall
set
off
at
daycare
"`A
veneziana'
vitesse
they
heard
the
voice
of
VetFran,
coming
back.
"`A
I've
made
such
a
discovery.
_Chief
a
perfect
Grete
and
I've
already
made
friends
with
her.
Really,
exceedingly
pretty,"
he
declared
in
a
tone
of
approval,
as
though
she
had
been
made
pretty
entirely
on
his
account,
and
he
was
expressing
his
satisfaction
with
the
entertainment
that
had
been
provided
for
him.
Levin
pretended
to
be
asleep,
while
Obninsk's
putting
on
his
slippers,
and
lighting
a
cigar,
walked
out
of
the
barn,
and
soon
their
voices
were
lost.
For
a
long
while
Levin
could
not
get
to
sleep.
He
heard
the
horses
munching
hay,
then
he
heard
the
peasant
and
his
elder
boy
getting
ready
for
the
night,
and
going
off
for
the
night
watch
with
the
beasts,
then
he
heard
the
soldier
arranging
his
bed
on
the
other
side
of
the
barn,
with
his
nephew,
the
younger
son
of
their
peasant
host.
He
heard
the
boy
in
his
shrill
little
voice
telling
his
uncle
what
he
thought
about
the
dogs,
who
seemed
to
him
huge
and
terrible
creatures,
and
asking
what
the
dogs
were
going
to
hunt
next
day,
and
the
soldier
in
a
husky,
sleepy
voice,
telling
him
the
sportsmen
were
going
in
the
morning
to
the
marsh,
and
would
shoot
with
their
gunsels
and
then,
to
check
the
boy's
questions,
he
said,
"Go
to
sleep,
Vasken,
go
to
sleep,
or
you'll
catch
it,"
and
soon
after
he
began
snoring
himself,
and
everything
was
still.
He
could
only
hear
the
snort
of
the
horses,
and
the
guttural
cry
of
a
sniped
"Is
it
really
only
negative?'
he
repeated
to
himself.
"Well,
what
of
it?
It's
not
my
fault."
And
he
began
thinking
about
the
next
day.
"Tomorrow
I'll
go
out
early,
and
I'll
make
a
point
of
keeping
cool.
There
are
lots
of
sniped
and
there
are
grouse
too.
When
I
come
back
there'll
be
the
note
from
Kitty.
Yes,
Stivaletti
may
be
right,
I'm
not
manly
with
her,
I'm
tied
to
her
apron.
Well,
it
can't
be
helped"
Negative
again:
Half
asleep,
he
heard
the
laughter
and
mirthful
talk
of
VetFran,
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
For
an
instant
he
opened
his
eyes:
the
moon
was
up,
and
in
the
open
doorway,
brightly
lighted
up
by
the
moonlight,
they
were
standing
talking.
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
saying
something
of
the
freshness
of
one
girl,
comparing
her
to
a
freshly
peeled
nut,
and
VetFran,
with
his
infectious
laugh
was
repeating
some
words,
probably
said
to
him
by
a
peasantry
"Ah,
you
do
your
best
to
get
round
her!"
Levin,
half
asleep,
said:
"Genuine"
tomorrow
before
daylight,
and
fell
asleep.
Chapter
12
Waking
up
at
earliest
dawn,
Levin
tried
to
wake
his
companions.
Vassilatos,
lying
on
his
stomach,
with
one
leg
in
a
stocking
thrust
out,
was
sleeping
so
soundly
that
he
could
elicit
no
response.
Obninsk's
half
asleep,
declined
to
get
up
so
early.
Even
Lasker
who
was
asleep,
curled
up
in
the
hay,
got
up
unwillingly.
and
lazily
stretched
out
and
straightened
her
hind
legs
one
after
the
other.
Getting
on
his
boots
and
stockings,
taking
his
gun,
and
carefully
opening
the
creaking
door
of
the
barn,
Levin
went
out
into
the
road.
The
coadjutor
were
sleeping
in
their
carriages,
the
horses
were
drab
Only
one
was
lazily
eating
oats,
dipping
its
nose
into
the
manger.
It
was
still
gray
out-of-favor
"Why
are
you
up
so
early,
my
dearer
the
old
woman,
their
hostess,
said,
coming
out
of
the
hut
and
addressing
him
affectionately
as
an
old
friend.
"Going
shooting,
grano
Do
I
go
this
way
to
the
marshal
"Straight
out
at
the
back;
by
our
threshold
floor,
my
dear,
and
hemp
patchiness
there's
a
little
footpaths
Stepping
carefully
with
her
suncare
bare
feet,
the
old
woman
conducted
Levin,
and
moved
back
the
fence
for
him
by
the
threshold
floor.
"Straight
on
and
you'll
come
to
the
marsh.
Our
lads
drove
the
cattle
there
yesterday
evening."
Lasker
ran
eagerly
forward
along
the
little
path.
Levin
followed
her
with
a
light,
rapid
step,
continually
looking
at
the
sky.
He
hoped
the
sun
would
not
be
up
before
he
reached
the
marsh.
But
the
sun
did
not
delay.
The
moon,
which
had
been
bright
when
he
went
out,
by
now
shone
only
like
a
crescent
of
quicky
The
pink
flush
of
dawn,
which
one
could
not
help
seeing
before,
now
had
to
be
sought
to
be
discerned
at
all.
What
were
before
undefined,
vague
blurs
in
the
distant
countryside
could
now
be
distinctly
seen.
They
were
shenanigans
of
ryegrass
The
dew,
not
visible
till
the
sun
was
up,
wetted
Levin's
legs
and
his
blouse
above
his
belt
in
the
high
growing,
fragrant
hemp
patch,
from
which
the
pollen
had
already
fallen
out.
In
the
transparent
stillness
of
morning
the
smallest
sounds
were
audible.
A
bee
flew
by
Levin's
ear
with
the
whizzing
sound
of
a
bullet.
He
looked
carefully,
and
saw
a
second
and
a
third.
They
were
all
flying
from
the
beek-International
behind
the
hedge,
and
they
disappeared
over
the
hemp
patch
in
the
direction
of
the
marsh.
The
path
led
straight
to
the
marsh.
The
marsh
could
be
recognized
by
the
mist
which
rose
from
it,
thicker
in
one
place
and
thinner
in
another,
so
that
the
reeds
and
willow
bushes
swayed
like
islands
in
this
mist.
At
the
edge
of
the
marsh
and
the
road,
peasant
boys
and
men,
who
had
been
herding
for
the
night,
were
lying,
and
in
the
dawn
all
were
asleep
under
their
coats.
Not
far
from
them
were
three
hobbled
horses.
One
of
them
clanked
a
chain.
Lasker
walked
beside
her
master,
pressing
a
little
forward
and
looking
round.
Passing
the
sleeping
peasants
and
reaching
the
first
reeds,
Levin
examined
his
pistols
and
let
his
dog
off.
One
of
the
horses,
a
sleek,
dark-cloaked
three-year-olds
seeing
the
dog,
started
away,
switched
its
tail
and
snorted:
The
other
horses
too
were
frightened,
and
splashing
through
the
water
with
their
hobbled
legs,
and
drawing
their
hoofs
out
of
the
thick
mud
with
a
squelching
sound,
they
bounded
out
of
the
marsh.
Lasker
stopped,
looking
ironically
at
the
horses
and
inquiry
at
Levin.
Levin
patted
Lasker
and
whistled
as
a
sign
that
she
might
begin.
Lasker
ran
joyfully
and
anxiously
through
the
slush
that
swayed
under
her.
Running
into
the
marsh
among
the
familiar
scents
of
roots,
marsh
plants,
and
slime,
and
the
extraneous
smell
of
horse
dung,
Lasker
detected
at
once
a
smell
that
pervaded
the
whole
marsh,
the
scent
of
that
strong-smelling
bird
that
always
excited
her
more
than
any
other.
Here
and
there
among
the
moss
and
marsh
plants
this
scent
was
very
strong,
but
it
was
impossible
to
determine
in
which
direction
it
grew
stronger
or
faintest
To
find
the
direction,
she
had
to
go
farther
away
from
the
wind.
Not
feeling
the
motion
of
her
legs,
Lasker
bounded
with
a
stiff
gallop,
so
that
at
each
bound
she
could
stop
short,
to
the
right,
away
from
the
wind
that
blew
from
the
east
before
sunrise,
and
turned
facing
the
wind.
Sniffing
in
the
air
with
dilation
nostrils,
she
felt
at
once
that
not
their
tracks
only
but
they
themselves
were
here
before
her,
and
not
one,
but
many.
Lasker
slackened
her
speed.
They
were
here,
but
where
precisely
she
could
not
yet
determine.
To
find
the
very
spot,
she
began
to
make
a
circle,
when
suddenly
her
master's
voice
drew
her
off.
"Latchford
here?"
he
asked,
pointing
her
to
a
different
direction.
She
stopped,
asking
him
if
she
had
better
not
go
on
doing
as
she
had
begun.
But
he
repeated
his
command
in
an
angry
voice,
pointing
to
a
spot
covered
with
water,
where
there
could
not
be
anything.
She
obeyed
him,
pretending
she
was
looking,
so
as
to
please
him,
went
round
it,
and
went
back
to
her
former
position,
and
was
at
once
aware
of
the
scent
again.
Now
when
he
was
not
hindering
her,
she
knew
what
to
do,
and
without
looking
at
what
was
under
her
feet,
and
to
her
vexatious
stumbling
over
a
high
stump
into
the
water,
but
righting
herself
with
her
strong,
supple
legs,
she
began
making
the
circle
which
was
to
make
all
clear
to
her.
The
scent
of
them
reached
her,
stronger
and
stronger,
and
more
and
more
defined,
and
all
at
once
it
became
perfectly
clear
to
her
that
one
of
them
was
here,
behind
this
tuft
of
reeds,
five
paces
in
front
of
her;
she
stopped,
and
her
whole
body
was
still
and
rigid.
On
her
short
legs
she
could
see
nothing
in
front
of
her,
but
by
the
scent
she
knew
it
was
sitting
not
more
than
five
paces
off.
She
stood
still,
feeling
more
and
more
conscious
of
it,
and
enjoying
it
in
anticipation.
Her
tail
was
stretched
straight
and
tense,
and
only
wagging
at
the
extreme
end.
Her
mouth
was
slightly
open,
her
ears
raised.
One
ear
had
been
turned
wrong
side
out
as
she
ran
up,
and
she
breathed
heavily
but
warily,
and
still
more
warily
looked
round,
but
more
with
her
eyes
than
her
head,
to
her
master.
He
was
coming
along
with
the
face
she
knew
so
well,
though
the
eyes
were
always
terrible
to
her.
He
stumbled
over
the
stump
as
he
came,
and
moved,
as
she
thought,
extraordinarily
slowly.
She
thought
he
came
slowly,
but
he
was
running.
Noticing
Lasker
special
attitude
as
she
crouched
on
the
ground,
as
it
were,
scratching
big
prints
with
her
hind
paws,"
and
with
her
mouth
slightly
open,
Levin
knew
she
was
pointing
at
grouse,
and
with
an
inward
prayer
for
luck,
especially
with
the
first
bird,
he
ran
up
to
her.
Coming
quite
close
up
to
her,
he
could
from
his
height
look
beyond
her,
and
he
saw
with
his
eyes
what
she
was
seeing
with
her
nose.
In
a
space
between
two
little
thickish
at
a
couple
of
yards'
distance,
he
could
see
a
groused
Turning
its
head,
it
was
listening.
Then
lightly
preening
and
folding
its
wings,
it
disappeared
round
a
corner
with
a
clumsy
wag
of
its
tail.
"Feuersnot"
it,
fetch
it!"
shouted
Levin,
giving
Lasker
a
shove
from
behind.
"But
I
can't
go,"
thought
Lasker
"Where
am
I
to
go?
From
here
I
feel
them,
but
if
I
move
forward
I
shall
know
nothing
of
where
they
are
or
who
they
are."
But
then
he
shoved
her
with
his
knee,
and
in
an
excited
whisper
said,
"Feuersnot"
it,
Lasker
"Well,
if
that's
what
he
wishes,
I'll
do
it,
but
I
can't
answer
for
myself
now,"
she
thought,
and
darted
forward
as
fast
as
her
legs
would
carry
her
between
the
thick
bushes.
She
scented
nothing
now;
she
could
only
see
and
hear,
without
understanding
anything.
Ten
paces
from
her
former
place
a
grouse
rose
with
a
guttural
cry
and
the
peculiar
round
sound
of
its
wings.
And
immediately
after
the
shot
it
splashed
heavily
with
its
white
breast
on
the
wet
mire.
Another
bird
did
not
linger,
but
rose
behind
Levin
without
the
dog.
When
Levin
turned
towards
it,
it
was
already
some
way
off.
But
his
shot
caught
it.
Flying
twenty
paces
further,
the
second
grouse
rose
upwards,
and
whirling
round
like
a
ball,
dropped
heavily
on
a
dry
place.
"Come,
this
is
going
to
be
some
good!"
thought
Levin,
packing
the
warm
and
fat
grouse
into
his
game
bag.
"Eight
Lasker
will
it
be
good?"
When
Levin,
after
loading
his
gun,
moved
on,
the
sun
had
fully
risen,
though
unseen
behind
the
storm-damaged
The
moon
had
lost
all
of
its
luster,
and
was
like
a
white
cloud
in
the
sky.
Not
a
single
star
could
be
seen.
The
sedges.
silvery
with
dew
before,
now
shone
like
gold.
The
stagnant
pools
were
all
like

The
blue

the
grass

changed
to

birds
twitty
and
swarmed
about
the
brook
and
upon
the
bushes
that
glittered
with
dew
and
cast
long
shadows.
A
hawk
woke
up
and
settled
on
a
haying
turning
its
head
from
side
to
side
and
looking
discontents
at
the
marsh.
Crowson,
were
flying
about
the
field,
and
a
bare-midriff
boy
was
driving
the
horses
to
an
old
man,
who
had
got
up
from
under
his
long
coat
and
was
combing
his
hair.
The
smoke
from
the
gun
was
white
as
milk
over
the
green
of
the
grass.
One
of
the
boys
ran
up
to
Levin.
"Uncommon
there
were
ducks
here
yesterday"
he
shouted
to
him,
and
he
walked
a
little
way
off
behind
him.
And
Levin
was
doubly
pleased,
in
sight
of
the
boy,
who
expressed
his
approval,
at
killing
three
sniped
one
after
another,
straight
off.
Chapter
13
The
sportsman's
saying,
that
if
the
first
beast
or
the
first
bird
is
not
missed,
the
day
will
be
lucky,
turned
out
correct.
At
ten
o'clock
Levin,
weary,
hungry,
and
happy
after
a
tramp
of
twenty
miles,
returned
to
his
night's
lodging
with
nineteen
head
of
fine
game
and
one
duck,
which
he
tied
to
his
belt,
as
it
would
not
go
into
the
game
bag.
His
companions
had
long
been
awake,
and
had
had
time
to
get
hungry
and
have
breakfast.
"Wait
a
bit,
wait
a
bit,
I
know
there
are
nineteenth
said
Levin,
counting
a
second
time
over
the
grouse
and
sniped
that
looked
so
much
less
important
now,
bent
and
dry
and
bloodstains
with
heads
crooked
aside,
than
they
did
when
they
were
flying.
The
number
was
verified,
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
envy
pleased
Levin.
He
was
pleased
too
on
returning
to
find
the
man
sent
by
Kitty
with
a
note
was
already
there.

a
new
bodyguard,
Maryam
Vlatkovic,
was
the
midwife,
a
new
and
important
personal
in
Levin's
domestic
life.
"She
has
come
to
have
a
look
at

She

These
two
pleasures,
his
lucky
shooting
and
the
letter
from
his
wife,
were
so
great
that
two
slightly
disagreeable
incidents
passed
lightly
over
Levin.
One
was
that

who
had
been
unmistakably
overworked
on
the
previous
day,
was
off

said
he

driven
ten
miles
with
no

The
other
unpleasant
incident,
which
for
the
first
minute
destroyed
his
good
humor,
though
later
he
laughed
at
it
a
great
deal,
was
to
find
that
of
all
the
provisions
Kitty
had
provided
in
such
abundance
that
one
would
have
thought
there
was
enough
for
a
week,
nothing
was
left.
On
his
way
back,
tired
and
hungry
from
shooting,
Levin
had
so
distinct
a
vision
of
meat-plant
that
as
he
approached
the
hut
he
seemed
to
smell
and
taste
them,
as
Lasker
had
smelt
the
game,
and
he
immediately
told
Philip
to
give
him
some.
It
appeared
that
there
were
no
pies
left,
nor
even
any
chicken.
"Well,
this
fellow's
appetite,
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
laughing
and
pointing
at
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
"I
never
suffer
from
loss
of
appetite,
but
he's
really
marvelous,
"Well,
it
can't
be
helped,"
said
Levin,
looking
gloomily
at
VetFran,
"Well,
Philip,
give
me
some
beef,
then."
"The
beef's
been
eaten,
and
the
bones
given
to
the
dogs,"
answered
Philip.
Levin
was
so
hurt
that
he
said,
in
a
tone
of
vexatious
"You
might
have
left
me
something"
and
he
felt
ready
to
cry.
"Then
put
away
the
game,"
he
said
in
a
shaking
voice
to
Philip,
trying
not
to
look
at
Vassilatos,
"and
cover
them
with
some

And
you
might
at

for

But
when
he
had
drunk
some
milk,
he
felt
ashamed
immediately
at
having
shown
his
annoyance
to
a
stranger,
and
he
began
to
laugh
at
his
hungry
mortified.
In
the
evening
they
went
shooting
again,
and
VetFran,
had
several
successful
shots,
and
in
the
night
they
drove
home.

was
as

had
been.

him

Chapter

Next
day
at
ten
o'clock
Levin,
who
had
already
gone
his
rounds,
knocked
at
the
room
where
Vassilatos,
had
been
put
for
the
night.
"`A

to
him.
"Excuse

he
said,
smiling,
standing
before
him
in
his
underclothes
only.
"Don't
mind
me,
please."
Levin
sat
down
in
the
window.
"Have
you
slept
well?'
"Like
the

A

now
would
be
capital.
You
show
me
your

After
walking
about
the
garden,
visiting
the
stable,
and
even
doing
some
gymnastic
exercises
together
on
the
parallel
bars,
Levin
returned
to
the
house
with
his
guest,
and
went
with
him
into
the
drawing
room.
"We
had
splendid
shooting,
and
so
many
delightful
experiences"
said
VetFran,
going
up
to
Kitty,
who
was
sitting
at
the
samovar.
"What
a
pity

are
cut
off
from
these
delights,
"Well,
I
suppose
he
must
say
something
to
the
lady
of
the
house,"
Levin
said
to
himself.
Again
he
fancied
something
in
the
smile,
in
the
all-consumed
air
with
which
their
guest
addressed
Kittyhawk
The
princess,
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
with
Maryam
Vlatkovic,
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
called
Levin
to
her
side,
and
began
to
talk
to
him
about
moving
to
Moscow
for
Kitty,
confinement,
and
getting
ready
rooms
for
them.
Just
as
Levin
had
disliked
all
the
trivial
preparations
for
his
wedding,
as
derogatory
to
the
grandeur
of
the
event,
now
he
felt
still
more
offensive
the
preparations
for
the
approaching
birth,
the
date
of
which
they
reckoned,
it
seemed,
on
their
fingers.
He
tried
to
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
these
discussions
of
the
best
patterns
of
long
clothes
for
the
coming
baby;
tried
to
turn
away
and
avoid
seeing
the
mysterious,
endless
strips
of
knitting,
the
triangles
of
linen,
and
so
on,
to
which
Dolly
attached
special
importance.
The
birth
of
a
son
(he
was
certain
it
would
be
a
son)
which
was
promised
him,
but
which
he
still
could
not
believe
in-House
marvelous
it
seemed.
itself
to
his
mind,
on
one
hand,
as
a
happiness
so
immense,
and
therefore
so
incredible;
on
the
other,
as
an
event
so
mysterious,
that
this
assumption
of
a
definite
knowledge
of
what
would
be,
and
consequent
preparation
for
it,
as
for
something
ordinary
that
did
happen
to
people,
jarred
on
him
as
confusing
and
humiliating.
But
the
princess
did
not
understand
his
feelings,
and
put
down
his
reluctance
to
think
and
talk
about
it
to
carelessness
and
indifference,
and
so
she
gave
him
no
peace.
She
had
commissioned
Stepan
Arkalyk
to
look
at
a
flat,
and
now
she
called
Levin
up.
"I
know
nothing
about
it,
princess.
Do
as
you
think
fit,"
he
said.
"You
must
decide
when
you
will
move."
"I
really
don't
know.
I
know
millions
of
children
are
born
away
from
Moscow,
and
doctors
...
why:
"But
if
so:
"Oh,
no,
as
Kitty
wishes."
"We
can't
talk
to
Kitty
about
it!
Do
you
want
me
to
frighten
her?
Why,
this
spring
Natalia
Golkar
died
from
having
an
ignorant
doctor."
"I
will
do
just
what
you
say,"
he
said
gloomy
The
princess
began
talking
to
him,
but
he
did
not
hear
her.
Though
the
conversation
with
the
princess
had
indeed
jarred
upon
him,
he
was
gloomy,
not
on
account
of
that
conversation,
but
from
what
he
saw
at
the
samovar.
"No,
it's
impossible,"
he
thought,
glancing
now
and
then
at
Vassilatos,
bending
over
Kitty,
telling
her
something
with
his
charming
smile,
and
at
her,
flushed
and
disturbed.
There
was
something
not
nice
in
Vassilatos,
attitude,
in
his
eyes,
in
his
smile.
Levin
even
saw
something
not
nice
in
Kitty,
attitude
and
look.
And
again
the
light
died
away
in
his
eyes.
Again,
as
before,
all
of
a
sudden,
without
the
slightest
transition,
he
felt
cast
down
from
a
pinnacle
of
happiness,
peace,
and
dignity,
into
an
abyss
of
despair,
rage,
and
humiliation.
Again
everything
and
everyone
had
become
hateful
to
him.
"You
do
just
as
you
think
best,
princess,"
he
said
again,
looking
round.
"Heavy
is
the
cap
of
Monona
Stepan
Arkalyk
said
playfulness"
hints
evidently,
not
simply
at
the
princess,
conversation,
but
at
the
cause
of
Levin's
agitation,
which
he
had
noticed.
"How
late
you
are
today,
Dolly!"
Everyone
got
up
to
greet
Darya
Alexei
Vassilatos,
only
rose
for
an
instant,
and
with
the
lack
of
courtesy
to
ladies
characteristic
of
the
modern
young
man,
he
scarcely
bowed,
and
resumed
his
conversation
again,
laughing
at
something.
"I've
been
worried
about
Masha.
She
did
not
sleep
well,
and
is
dreadfully
tiresome
today,"
said
Dolly.
The
conversation
Vassilatos,
had
started
with
Kitty
was
running
on
the
same
lines
as
on
the
previous
evening,
discussing
Anna,
and
whether
love
is
to
be
put
higher
than
worldly
considerations.
Kitty
disliked
the
conversation,
and
she
was
disturbed
both
by
the
subject
and
the
tone
in
which
it
was
conducted,
and
also
by
the
knowledge
of
the
effect
it
would
have
on
her
husband.
But
she
was
too
simple
and
innocent
to
know
how
to
cut
short
this
conversation,
or
even
to
conceal
the
superficial
pleasure
afforded
her
by
the
young
man's
very
obvious
admiration.
She
wanted
to
stop
it,
but
she
did
not
know
what
to
do.
Whatever
she
did
she
knew
would
be
observed
by
her
husband,
and
the
worst
interpretation
put
on
it.
And,
in
fact,
when
she
asked
Dolly
what
was
wrong
with
Masha.
and
Vassilatos,
waiting
till
this
uninteresting
conversation
was
over,
began
to
gaze
indifferently
at
Dolly,
the
question
struck
Levin
as
an
unnatural
and
disgusting
piece
of
hypocrisy.
"What
do
you
say,
shall
we
go
and
look
for
mushrooms
today?"
said
Dolly.
"By
all
means,
please,
and
I
shall
come
too,"
said
Kitty,
and
she
blushed.
She
wanted
from
politeness
to
ask
Vassilatos,
whether
he
would
come,
and
she
did
not
ask
him.
"Where
are
you
going,
Kostyra,
she
asked
her
husband
with
a
guilty
face,
as
he
passed
by
her
with
a
resolute
step.
This
guilty
air
confirmed
all
his
suspicions.
"The
mechaniclal
came
when
I
was
away;
I
haven't
seen
him
yet,"
he
said,
not
looking
at
her.
He
went
downstairs,
but
before
he
had
time
to
leave
his
study
he
heard
his
wife's
familiar
footsteps
running
with
reckless
speed
to
him.
"What
do
you
want?"
he
said
to
her
shortly.
"We
are
busy."
"I
beg
your
pardon,"
she
said
to
the
German
mechaniclal
"I
want
a
few
words
with
my
husband."
The
German
would
have
left
the
room,
but
Levin
said
to
him:
"Don't
disturb
yourself."
"The
train
is
at
three?"
queried
the
German.
"I
mustn't
be
late."
Levin
did
not
answer
him,
but
walked
out
himself
with
his
wife.
"Well,
what
have
you
to
say
to
me?"
he
said
to
her
in
French.
He
did
not
look
her
in
the
face,
and
did
not
care
to
see
that
she
in
her
condition
was
trembling
all
over,
and
had
a
pitfall
crushed
look.
"I
...
I
want
to
say
that
we
can't
go
on
like
this;
that
this
is
misfeasance,
she
said.
"The
servants
are
here
at
the
sideburns
he
said
angry
"don't
make
a
scene."
"Well,
let's
go
in
here!"
They
were
standing
in
the
passage.
Kitty
would
have
gone
into
the
next
room,
but
there
the
English
governess
was
giving
Tanya
a
lesson.
"Well,
come
into
the
garden."
In
the
garden
they
came
upon
a
peasant
weeding
the
path.
And
no
longer
considering
that
the
peasant
could
see
her
tear-stained
and
his
agitated
face,
that
they
looked
like
people
fleeing
from
some
disaster,
they
went
on
with
rapid
steps,
feeling
that
they
must
speak
out
and
clear
up
misunderstandings,
must
be
alone
together,
and
so
get
rid
of
the
misery
they
were
both
feeling.
"We
can't
go
on
like
this!
It's
misery"
I
am

she
said,
when
they
had
at
last
reached
a
solitary
garden

at
a
turn
in
the
lime

avenue.
"But
tell
me
one
thing:

in
his
tone

unseemly.

he
said,
standing
before
her
again
in
the
same
position
with
his
clenched
fists
on
his
chest,
as
he
had
stood
before
her
that
night.
"Yes,"
she
said
in
a
shaking
voice;
"but,
Kostyra,
surely
you
see
I'm
not
to
blame?
All
the

I've

trying

take

she
said,
breathless
with
the
sobs
that
shook
her.
Although
nothing
had
been
pursuing
them,
and
there
was
nothing
to
run
away
from,
and
they
could
not
possibly
have
found
anything
very
delightful
on
that
garden
seat,
the
gardener
saw
with
astonishment
that
they
passed
him
on
their
way
home
with
comforted
and
radiant
faces.
Chapter
15
After
escorting
his
wife
upstairs,
Levin
went
to
Dolly,
part
of
the
house.
Darya
Alexei
for
her
part,
was
in
great
distress
too
that
day.
She
was
walking
about
the
room,
talking
angrily
to
a
little
girl,
who
stood
in
the
corner
roaring.
"And
you
shall
stand
all

in
the

have

she
said,
not
knowing
how
to
punish
her.
"Oh,
she
is
a
disgusting
child"
she
turned
to
Levin.
"Where
does
she
get

wicked
propensity
"Why,
what
has
she
done?"
Levin
said
without
much
interest,
for
he
had
wanted
to
ask
her
advice,
and
so
was
annoyed
that
he
had
come
at
an
unlucky
moment.
"Grito

"That

at
all,
it's
simply

Levin
assured
her.
"But
you
are
upset
about
something?
What
have
you
come
for?"
asked
Dolly.
"What's
going
on
there?"
And
in
the
tone
of
her
question
Levin
heard
that
it
would
be
easy
for
him
to
say
what
he
had
meant
to
say.
"I've
not
been
in

been

can
say
you're

"No,
no,
I'll
do
it
myself."
"But
you'll
quarrel
with
him?"
"Not
a
bit.
I
shall
so
enjoy
it,"
Levin
said,
his
eyes
flashing
with
real
enjoyment.
"Come,
forgive
her,
Dolly,
she
won't
do
it
again,"
he
said
of
the
little
sinner,
who
had
not
gone
to
Fanny,
but
was
standing
irrespective
before
her
mother,
waiting
and
looking
up
from
under
her
brows
to
catch
her
mother's
eye.
The
mother
glanced
at
her.
The
child
broke
into
sobs,
hid
her
face
on
her
mother's
lap,
and
Dolly
laid
her
thin,
tender
hand
on
her
head.
"And
what
is
there
in
common
between
us
and
him?"
thought
Levin,
and
he
went
off
to
look
for
VetFran,
As
he
passed
through
the
passage
he
gave
orders
for
the
carriage
to
be
got
ready
to
drive
to
the
station.
"The

said

Levin
came
upon
VetFran,
at
the
moment
when
the
latter,
having
unpacked
his
things
from
his
trunk,
and
laid
out
some
new
songs,
was
putting
on
his
gaits,
to
go
out
riding.

there
was

in

face,
or

he
was
somewhat
(as

at

entrance.
"You

Vassilatos,
putting
his

on

fastening

and
smiling
with
simple-living

humor.
He
was
undoubtedly
a
good-natured
fellow,
and

felt

for

ashamed
of

On
the
table
lay
a
piece
of
stick
which
they
had
broken
together
that
morning,
trying
their
strength.
Levin
took
the
fragment
in
his
hands
and
began
smashing
it
up,
breaking
bits
off
the
stick,
not
knowing
how
to
begin.
"I

He
paused,
but
suddenly,
remembering
Kitty
and
everything
that
had
happened,
he
said,
looking
him
resolutely
in
the
face;
"I
have
ordered
the
horses
to
be
put-upon
for
you."
"How
so?"
Vassilatos,
began
in
surprise.
"To
drive
where?"
"For
you
to
drive
to
the
station,"
Levin
said
gloomy
"Are
you
going
away,
or
has
something
happened?"
"It

that
I
expect

said
Levin,
his
strong
fingers
more
and
more
rapidly
breaking
off
the
ends
of
the
split
stick.
"And
I'm
not
expecting

and
nothing
has
happened,
but
I
beg
you
to
go
away.
You
can
explain
my
rudeness
as
you
like."
Vassilatos,
drew
himself
up.
"I
beg
you
to
explain:
he
said
with
dignity,
understanding
at
last.
"I
can't
explain,"
Levin
said
softly
and
deliberately,
trying
to
control
the
trembling
of
his
jawbone
"and
you'd
better
not
ask."
And
as
the
split
ends
were
all
broken
off,
Levin
clutched
the
thick
ends
in
his
finger,
broke
the
stick
in
two,
and
carefully
caught
the
end
as
it
fell.

had

of
the
glittering

and

than

bowed,
shrugging

shoulders,
and

The
shrug
and
the

did
not
irritate
Levin.
"What

there
for

to
do?"
he
thought.
"I'll
send
him
to
you
at

"What

Stepan

said
when,
after
hearing
from
his
friend
that
he
was
being
turned
out
of

he
found
Levin
in
the

he
was

for

walked
away
from

he

down

Darya
Alexei
carried
out
her
intention
and
went
to
see
Anna.
She
was
sorry
to
annoy
her
sister
and
to
do
anything
Levin
disliked.
She
quite
understood
how
right
the
Levins
were
in
not
wishing
to
have
anything
to
do
with
Vrye
But
she
felt
she
must
go
and
see
Anna,
and
show
her
that
her
feelings
could
not
be
changed,
in
spite
of
the
change
in
her
position.
That
she
might
be

but
Levin
learning
of
it
went
to
her
to
protest.
"What
makes
you
suppose
that
I
dislike
your
going?
But,
even
if
I
did
dislike
it,
I
should
still
more
dislike
your
not
taking
my
horses,"
he
said.
"You
never
told
me
that
you
were
going
for
certain.
Hiring
horses
in
the
village
is
disagreeable
to
me,
and,
what's
of
more
importance,
they'll
undertake
the
job
and
never
get
you
there.
I
have

And
if
you
don't
want
to
wound
me,
you'll
take
mine."
Darya

had
to
consent,
and

the
day

for

At
that
moment,
when
horses
were
wanted
for
the
princess,
who
was
going,
and
for
the
midwife,
it
was
a
difficult
matter
for
Levin
to
make
up
the
number,
but
the
duties
of
hospitality
would
not
let
him
allow
Darya
Alexei
to
hire
horses
when
staying
in
his
house.
Moreover,
he
was
well
aware
that
the
twenty
roubles
that
would
be
asked
for
the
journey
were
a
serious
matter
for
her;

by
Levin's
advice,
started
before

dozed
and
waked
up
only
on
reaching

where
the

were
to
be

at

had
stayed

and
chatting
with
the
women
about
their
children,
and
with
the
old
man
about
Count
Vrye
whom
the
latter
praised
very
highly,
Darya
Alexei
at
ten
o'clock,
went
on
again.
At
home,
looking
after
her
children,
she
had
no
time
to
think.
So
now,
after
this
journey
of
four
hours,
all
the
thoughts
she
had
suppressed
before
rushed
swarming
into
her
brain,
and
she
thought
over
all
her
life
as
she
never
had
before,
and
from
the
most
different
points
of
view.
Her
thoughts
seemed
strange
even
to
herself.
At
first
she
thought
about
the
children,
about
whom
she
was
uneasy,
although
the
princess
and
Kitty
(she
reckoned
more
upon
her)
had
promised
to
look
after
them.

her
naughty
tricks,
if
Grisham
isn't
kicked
by
a
horse,
and
Lily,
stomach
isn't

she
thought.
But
these
questions
of
the
present
were
succeeded
by
questions
of
the
immediate
future.
She
began
thinking
how
she
had
to
get
a
new
flat
in
Moscow
for
the
coming
winter,
to
renew
the
drawing
room
furniture,
and
to
make
her
elder
girl
a
cloak.
Then
questions
of
the
more
remote
future
occurred
to
her:
how
she
was
to
place
her
children
in
the
world.
"The
girls
are
all
right,"
she
thought;
"but
the
boyswear
"It's
very
well
that
I'm
teaching
Grisham
but

because

And
with

but

And
the
thought
struck
her
how
untrustworthy
it
was
said
that
the
curse
laid
on
woman
was
that
in
sorrow
she
should
bring
forth
children.
"The
birth
itself,
that's
nothing;
but
the
months
of
carrying
the
child-abuse
what's
so
intolerable,"
she
thought,
picturing
to
herself
her
last
pregnancy,
and
the
death
of
the
last
baby.
And
she
recalled
the
conversation
she
had
just
had
with
the
young
woman
at
the
inn.
On
being
asked
whether
she
had
any
children,
the
handsome
young
woman
had
answered
cheerfulness
"I
had
a
girl

but
God
set
me
free;

her

"Well,

Alexei

This
answer
had
struck
Darya
Alexei
as
revolting
in
spite
of
the
good-natured
and
pleasing
face
of
the
young
woman?
but
now
she
could
not
help
recalling
these
words.
In
those
cynical
words
there
was
indeed
a
grain
of
truth.
"Yes,
altogether,"
thought
Darya
Alexei
looking
back
over
her
whole
existence
during
those
fifteen
years
of
her
married
life,

And
there
rose
again
before
her
imagination
the
cruel
memory,
that
always
tore
her
mother's

of
the
death
of

the
callous
indifference
of

at

and
her

and
her
lonely
anguish
at
the
sight
of
the
pale

with
its
projecting
temples,
and
the
open,
wondering

in

at

when

was

on

Again
she
recalled
what
the

had
said,
and
again
she
was
revolted
at
the
thought;
but
she
could
not

was

of

in
the
words.

they
say,
it's
five
miles."
The
carriage
drove
along
the
village
street
and
onto
a
bridge.
On
the
bridge
was
a
crowd
of
peasant
women
with
coils
of
ties
for
the
shenanigans
on
their
shoulders,
gaily
and
noisily
chatters
They
stood
still
on
the
bridge,
staring
inquisitor,
at
the
carriage.
All
the
faces
turned
to
Darya
Alexei
looked
to
her
healthy
and
happy,
making
her
envious
of
their
enjoyment
of
life.
"They're
all
living,
they're
all
enjoying
life,"
Darya
Alexei
still
mused
when
she
had
passed
the
peasant
women
and
was
driving
uphill
again
at
a
null
seated
comfortably
on
the
soft
springs
of
the
old
carriage,
"while
I,
let
out,
as
it
were
from

from
the

that
fret
me
to

looking
about
me
now
for
an
instant.
They
all

and

whom
I

I
have,
anyway,

as
I
should
like
to
love
him,
still
I
do
love
him,
while
Anna
never
loved
hers.
How
is
she
to
blame?
She
wants
to
live.
God
has
put
that
in
our
hearts.
Very
likely
I
should
have
done
the
same.
Even
to
this
day
I
don't
feel
sure
I
did
right
in
listening
to
her
at
that
terrible
time
when
she
came
to
me
in
Moscow.
I
ought
then
to
have
cast
off
my
husband
and
have
begun
my
life
fresh.
I
might
have
loved
and
have
been
loved
in
reality.
And
is
it
any
better
as
it
is?
I
don't
respect
him.
He's
necessary
to
me,"
she
thought
about
her
husband,
"and
I
put
up
with
him.
Is
that
any
better?
At
that
time
I
could
still
have
been
admired,
I
had
beauty
left
me
still,"
Darya
Alexei
pursued
her
thoughts,
and
she
would
have
liked
to
look
at
herself
in
the
looking
glass.
She
had
a
traveling
looking
glass
in
her
handbag,
and
she
wanted
to
take
it
out;
but
looking
at
the
backs
of
the
coachman,
and
the
swaying
counting
house
clerk,
she
felt
that
she
would
be
ashamed
if
either
of
them
were
to
look
round,
and
she
did
not
take
out
the
glass.
But
without
looking
in
the
glass,
she
thought
that
even
now
it
was
not
too
late;
and
she
thought
of
Sergey

attentive

Turow
who
had
helped

and
was
in

with
her.
And
there
was
someone
else,
a
quite
young
man,
who-does-what

had
told
her
it
as
a
joke-telling
her
more
beautiful
than
either
of
her
sisters.
And
the
most
passionate
and
impossible
romances
rose
before

"Anna
did
quite
right,
and
certainly
I
shall
never
reproach
her
for
it.
She
is
happy,
she
makes
another
person
happy,
and
she's
not
broken
down
as
I
am,
but
most
likely
just
as
she
always
was,
bright,
clever,
open
to
every
impression,"
thought
Darya
Alexei
a
sly
smile
curved
her
lips,
for,
as
she
pondered
on
Anna's
love
affair,
Darya
Alexei
constructed
on
parallel
lines
an
almost
identical
love
affair
for
herself,
with
an
imaginary
composite
figure,
the
ideal
man
who
was
in
love
with
her.
She,
like
Anna,
confessed
the
whole
affair
to
her
husband.
And
the
amazement
and
perplexity
of
Stepan

at
this

made
her
smile.

When

of

deports
impressed
Dolly.
For
the
first
minute
it
seemed
to
her
unsuitable
for
Anna
to
be
on
horseback.
The
conception
of
riding
on
horseback
for
a
lady
was,
in
Darya
Alexei
mind,
associated
with
ideas
of
youthful
flirtation
and
frivolity,
which,
in
her
opinion,
was
unbecoming
in
Anna's
position.
But
when
she
had
scrutinized
her,
seeing
her
closer,
she
was
at
once
reconciled
to
her
riding.
In
spite
of
her
elegance,
everything
was
so
simple,
quiet,
and
dignified
in
the
attitude,
the
dress
and
the
movements
of
Anna,
that
nothing
could
have
been
more
natural.
Beside
Anna,
on
a
hot-melt
gray

horse,
was

could
not

good-humored
smile
as
she
recognized

from

with

at
the
instant
when,
in
the
little
figure
huddled
in
a
corner
of
the
old
carriage,
she
recognized
Dolly.
She
uttered
a
cry,
started
in

and
set
her
horse
into
a
gallop.
On
reaching
the
carriage
she
jumped
off
without
assistance,
and
holding
up
her
riding
habit,
she
ran
up
to
greet
Dolly.
"I
thought
it
was
you
and
dared
not
think
it.
How
delightful,
You
can't
fancy
how
glad
I
am!"
she
said,
at
one
moment
pressing
her
face
against
Dolly
and
kissing
her,
and
at
the
next
holding
her
off
and
examining
her
with
a
smile.
"Here's
a

she
said,
looking
round
at
Vrye
who
had
dismounts
and
was
walking
towards
them.
Vrye
taking
off
his
tall
gray
hat,
went
up
to
Dolly.
"You
wouldn't
believe
how

we
are
to

you,"
he
said,
giving
peculiar
significance
to
the
words,
and
showing
his
strong
white
teeth
in
a
smile.
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
without
getting
off
his
horse,

off

were
fairly
dazzled
by
the

carriage
of
a
pattern
she
had
never
seen
before,
the
splendid
horses,
and
the
elegant
and
gorgeous
people
surrounding
her.
But
what
struck
her
most
of
all
was
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
Anna,
whom
she
knew
so
well
and
loved.
Any

or
not
having
thought
as
Darya
Alexei
had
been
thinking
on
the
road,
would
not
have
noticed
anything
special
in
Anna.
But
now
Dolly
was
struck
by
that
temporary
beauty,
which
is
only
found
in
women
during
the
moments
of
love,
and
which
she
saw
now
in
Anna's
face.
Everything
in

the
line

the

were,
fluttered
about

the
brilliance
of
her

the
grace
and
rapidity
of
her
movements,
the
fulsome
of

her

even
the
manner
in

with
a
sort

in

When

were
seated
in
the

a

embarrassment
came
over
both
of
them.

to
change
the
conversation
and
pointing
to
the
red
and
green
roofs
that
came
into
view
behind
the
green
hedges
of
acacias.
and
lilacs
"Quite
a
little
town."
But
Anna
did
not
answer.
"No,
no!
How
do
you
look
at
my
position,
what
do
you
think
of
it?"
she
asked.
"I

was
beginning,
but
at
that
instant
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
having
brought
the
cob
to
gallop
with
the
right
leg
foremost,
galloped
past
them,
bumping
heavily
up
and
down
in
his
short
jacket
on
the
chamois
leather
of
the
side
saddle.
"He's
doing
it,
Anna
Arkalyk
he
shouted.
Anna
did
not
even
glance
at
him;
but
again
it
seemed
to
Darya
Alexei
out
of
place
to
enter
upon
such
a
long
conversation
in
the
carriage,
and
so
she
cut
short
her
thought.
"I
don't
think
anything,"
she
said,
"but
I
always
loved
you,
and
if
one
loves
anyone,
one
loves
the
whole
person,
just
as
they
are
and
not
as
one
would
like
them
to
be:
Anna,
taking
her
eyes
off
her
friend's
face
and
dropping
her
eyelids
(this
was
a
new
habit
Dolly
had
not
seen
in
her
before),
pondered,
trying
to
penetrate
the
full
significance
of
the
words.
And
obviously
interpreting
them
as
she
would
have
wished,
she
glanced
at
Dolly.
"If
you
had
any
sins,"
she
said,
"they
would
all
be
forgiven
you
for
your
coming
to
see
me
and
these
words."
And
Dolly
saw
that
tears
stood
in
her
eyes.
She
pressed
Anna's
hand
in
silence.
"Well,
what
are
these
buildings?
How
many
there
are
of
them!"'
After
a
moment's
silence
she
repeated
her
question.
"These
are
the
servants'
houses,
barns,
and
stables.
answered
Anna.
"And
there
the
park
begins.
It
had
all
gone
to
ruin,
but
Alexey
had
everything
renewed.
He
is
very
fond
of
this
place,
and,
what
I
never
expected,
he
has
become
intensely
interested
in
looking
after
it.
But
his
is
such
a
rich
nature"
Whatever
he
takes
up,
he
does
splendidly.
So
far
from
being
bored
by
it,
he
works
with
passionate
interest.
He-Man
his
temperament
as
I
know
it-can't-happen-to-me
has
become
careful
and
businesslike,
a
first-rate
manager,
he
positively
reckons
every
penny
in
his
management
of
the
land.
But
only
in
that.
When
it's
a
question
of
tens
of
thousands,
he
doesn't
think
of
money."
She
spoke
with
that
gleefully
sly
smile
with
which
women
often
talk
of
the
secret
characteristics
only
known
to
them.
those
they
love.
"Do
you
see
that
big
building?
that's
the
new
hospital.
I
believe
it
will
cost
over
a
hundred
thousands
that's
his
hobby
just
now.
And
do
you
know
how
it
all
came
about?
The
peasants
asked
him
for
some
meadowlark
I
think
it
was,
at
a
cheaper
rate,
and
he
refused,
and
I
accused
him
of
being
miserly.
Of
course
it
was
not
really
because
of
that,
but
everything
together,
he
began
this
hospital
to
prove,
do
you
see,
that
he
was
not
miserly
about
money.
_California,
une
petition
if
you
like,
but
I
love
him
all
the
more
for
it.
And
now
you'll
see
the
house
in
a
moment.
It
was
his
grandfather's
house,
and
he
has
had
nothing
changed
outside."
"How
null
said
Dolly,
looking
with
involuntary
admiration
at
the
handsome
house
with
columns,
standing
out
among
the
different-colored
greens
of
the
old
trees
in
the
garden.
"Isn't
it
fine?
And
from
the
house,
from
the
top,
the
view
is
wonderful."
They
drove
into
a
courtyard
strewn
with
gravel
and
bright
with
flowers,
in
which
two
laborers
were
at
work
putting
an
edging
of
stones
round
the
light
mould
of
a
flower
bed,
and
drew
up
in
a
covered
entry.
"Ah,
they're
here
already!"
said
Anna,
looking
at
the
saddle
horses,
which
were
just
being
led
away
from
the
steps.
"It
is
a
nice
horse,
isn't
it?
It's
my
coble
my
favorite.
Lead
him
here
and
bring
me
some

she
inquired
of
two
smart
footmen,
who
darted
out.
"Ah,

she
said,
seeing
Vrye
coming
to
meet
her
with
VetFran,
"Where
are
you
going
to
put

said
Vrye
in
French,
addressing
Anna,
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply,
he
once
more
greeted
Darya
Alexei
and
this
time
he
kissed
her
hand.
"I
think

"Oh,

said
Anna,
as
she
gave
her

footmen,
had
brought
her.
"`A

she
said
to

who
came

on
the
steps.

answered,
smiling,
putting
his

his

she
said,
rubbing
her
handkerchief
on
her
hand,
which
the
horse
had
made
wet
in
taking
the
sugar.
Anna
turned
to
Dolly.
"You
can
stay
some
time?
For
one
day
only?
That's
impossible"
"I
promised
to
be
back,
and
the
children:
said
Dolly,
feeling
embarrassed
both
because
she
had
to
get
her
bag
out
of
the
carriage,
and
because
she
knew
her
face
must
be
covered
with
dust.
"No,
Dolly,
darling"),
Well,
we'll
see.
Come
along,
come
along"
and
Anna
led
Dolly
to
her
room.
That
room
was
not
the
smart
guest
chamber
Vrye
had
suggested,
but
the
one
of
which
Anna
had
said
that
Dolly
would
excuse
it.
And
this
room,
for
which
excuse
was
needed,
was
more
full
of
luxury
than
any
in
which
Dolly
had
ever
stayed,
a
luxury
that
reminded
her
of
the
best
hotels
abroad.
"Well,
darling,
how
happy
I
am!"
Anna
said,
sitting
down
in
her
riding
habit
for
a
moment
beside
Dolly.
"Tell
me
about
all
of
you.
Stivaletti
I
had
only
a
glimpse
of,
and
he
cannot
tell
one
about
the
children.
How
is
my
favorite,
Tao-ming
Quite
a
big
girl,
I
expect?'
"Yes,
she's
very
tall,"
Darya
Alexei
answered
shortly,
surprised
herself
that
she
should
respond
so
coolly
about
her
children.
"We
are
having
a
delightful
stay
at
the
Levins,
she
added.
"Oh,
if
I
had
known,"
said
Anna,
"that
you
do
not
despise
me"
You
might
have
all
come
to
us.
Stivaletti
an
old
friend
and
a
great
friend
of
Alexeyev
you
know,"
she
added,
and
suddenly
she
blushed.
"Yes,
but
we
are
all:
Dolly
answered
in
confusion.
"But
in
my
delight
I'm
talking
nonsense.
The
one
thing,
darling,
is
that
I
am
so
glad
to
have
you!"
said
Anna,
kissing
her
again.
"You
haven't
told
me
yet
how
and
what
you
think
about
me,
and
I
keep
wanting
to
know.
But
I'm
glad
you
will
see
me
as
I
am.
The
chief
thing
I
shouldn't
like
would
be
for
people
to
imagine
I
want
to
prove
anything.
I
don't
want
to
prove
anything;
I
merely
want
to
live,
to
do
no
one
harm
but
myself.
I
have
the
right
to
do
that,
haven't
I?
But
it
is
a
big
subject,
and
we'll
talk
over
everything
properly
later.
Now
I'll
go
and
dress
and
send
a
maid
to
you."
Chapter
19
Left
alone,
Darya
Alexei
with
a
good
housewife's
eye,
scanned
her
room.
All
she
had
seen
in
entering
the
house
and
walking
through
it,
and
all
she
saw
now
in
her
room,
gave
her
an
impression
of
wealth
and
sumptuousness
and
of
that
modern
European
luxury
of
which
she
had
only
read
in
English
novels,
but
had
never
seen
in
Russia
and
in
the
country.
Everything
was
new
from
the
new
French
hangings
on
the
walls
to
the
carpet
which
covered
the
whole
floor.
The
bed
had
a
spring
mattress,"
and
a
special
sort
of
bolster
and
silk
pillowed
on
the
little
pillows.
The
marble
washtubs.
the
dressing
table,
the
little
sofa,
the
tables,
the
bronze
clock
on
the
chimney
piece,
the
window
curtains,
and
the
_received
were
all
new
and
expensive.
The
smart
maid,
who
came
in
to
offer
her
services,
with
her
hair
done
up
high,
and
a
gown
more
fashionable
than
Dolly,
was
as
new
and
expensive
as
the
whole
room.
Darya
Alexei
liked
her
neatness.
her
deferential
and
obliging
manners,
but
she
felt
ill
at
ease
with
her.
She
felt
ashamed
of
her
seeing
the
patched
dressing
jacket
that
had
unlucky
been
packed
by
mistake
for
her.
She
was
ashamed
of
the
very
patches
and
darned
places
of
which
she
had
been
so
proud
at
home.
At
home
it
had
been
so
clear
that
for
six
dressing
jackets
there
would
be
needed
twenty-mile-wide
yards
of
naira
at
sixteen
pence
the
yard,
which
was
a
matter
of
thirty
shillings
besides
the
cutting-room
and
making,
and
these
thirty
shillings
had
been
saved.
But
before
the
maid
she
felt,
if
not
exactly
ashamed,
at
least
uncomfortable.
Darya
Alexei
had
a
great
sense
of
relief
when
Anny
whom
she
had
known
for
years,
walked
in.
The
smart
maid
was
sent
for
to
go
to
her
mistress,
and
Anny
remained
with
Darya
Alexei
Anny
was
obviously
much
pleased
at
that
lady's
arrival,
and
began
to
chatter
away
without
a
pause.
Dolly
observed
that
she
was
longing
to
express
her
opinion
in
regard
to
her
mistress,

especially
as
to
the
love
and
devotion
of
the
count
to
Anna
Arkalyk
but
Dolly
carefully
interrupted
her
whenever
she
began
to
speak
about
this.
"I
grew
up
with
Anna
Arkalyk
my
lady's
dearer
to
me
than
anything.
Well,
it's
not
for
us
to

And,
to
be

there

Darya

cut
her
short.

things,
but
most
of

Ah,
what
a
husband",
Dolly
was
glad
when
Anna
came
in,
and
by
her
entrance
put
a
stop
to
Anny
gossip.
Anna
had
put
on
a
very
simple
batlike
gown.
Dolly
scrutinized
that
simple
gown
attentively.
She
knew
what
it
meant,
and
the
price
at
which
such
simplicity
was
obtained.
"An
old
friend,"
said
Anna
of
Anny
Anna
was
not
embarrassed
now.
She
was
perfectly
composed
and
at
ease.
Dolly
saw
that
she
had
now
completely
recovered
from
the
impression
her
arrival
had
made
on
her,
and
had
assumed
that
superficial,
careless
tone
which,
as
it
were,
closed
the
door
on
that
compartment
in
which
her
deeper
feelings
and
ideas
were
kept.
"Well,
Anna,
and
how
is
your
little
girl?"'
asked
Dolly.
"Anniversary
(This
was
what
she
called

"Very

"But

Dolly
was
beginning
a
question
as
to
what
name
the
little
girl
would
have;
but
noticing
a
sudden
frown
on
Anna's
face,
she
changed
the
drift
of
her
question.
"How

"But

her
face
suddenly
brightens
"Come,

_Enactment

She
crawls
now."
In
the
nursery
the
luxury
which
had
impressed
Dolly
in
the
whole
house
struck
her
still
more.
There
were
little
go-cups
ordered
from
England,
and
appliances
for
learning
to
walk,
and
a
sofa
after
the
fashion
of
a
billiard
table,
purposely
constructed
for
crawling,
and
swings
and
baths,
all
of
special
pattern,
and
modern.
They
were
all
English,
solid,
and
of
good
make,
and
obviously
very
expensive.
The
room
was
large,
and
very
light
and
null
When
they
went
in,
the
baby,
with
nothing
on
but
her
little
smock,
was
sitting
in
a
little
elbow
chair
at
the
table,
having
her
dinner
of
broth,
which
she
was
spilling
all
over
her
little
chest.
The
baby
was
being
fed,
and
the
Russian
nursery
maid
was
evidently
sharing
her
meal.
Neither
the
wet-weather
nor
the
head
nurse
were
there;
they
were
in
the
next
room,
from
which
came
the
sound
of
their
conversation
in
the
queer,
French
which
was
their
only
means
of
communication.
Hearing
Anna's
voice,
a
smart,
tall,
English
nurse
with
a
disagreeable
face
and
a
dissolute
expression
walked
in
at
the
door,
hurriedly
shaking
her
fair
curls,
and
immediately
began
to
defend
herself
though
Anna
had
not
found
fault
with
her.
At
every
word
Anna
said,
the
English
nurse
said
hurriedly
several
times,
"Yes,
my
lady."
The
rosy
baby
with
her
black
eyebrows
and
hair,
her
sturdy
red
little
body
with
tight
goose-pimples
skin,
delighted
Darya
Alexei
in
spite
of
the
cross
expression
with
which
she
stared
at
the
stranger.
She
positively
envied
the
baby's
healthy
appearance.
She
was
delighted,
too,
at
the
baby's
crawling.
Not
one
of
her
own
children
had
crawled
like
that.
When
the
baby
was
put
on
the
carpet
and
its
little
dress
tucked
up
behind,
it
was
wonderfully
charming.
Looking
round
like
some
little
wild
animal
at
the
grown-up
big
people
with
her
bright
black
eyes,
she
smiled,
unmistakably
pleased
at
their
admiring
her,
and
holding
her
legs
sideways,
she
pressed
vigorously
on
her
arms,
and
rapidly
drew
her
whole
back
up
after,
and
then
made
another
step
forward
with
her
little
arms.
But
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
nursery,
and
especially
the
English
nurse,
Darya
Alexei
did
not
like
at
all.
It
was
only
on
the
supposition
that
no
good
nurse
would
have
entered
so
irregular
a
household
as
Anna's
that
Darya
Alexei
could
explain
to
herself
how
Anna
with
her
insight
into
people
could
take
such
an
unpresidential,
disreputable.
woman
as
nurse
to
her
child.
Besides,
from
a
few
words
that
were
dropped,
Darya
Alexei
saw
at
once
that
Anna,
the
two
nurses,
and
the
child
had
no
common
existence,
and
that
the
mother's
visit
was
something
exceptional.
Anna
wanted
to
get
the
baby
her
plaything,
and
could
not
find
it.
Most
amazing
of
all
was
the
fact
that
on
being
asked
how
many
teeth
the
baby
had,
Anna
answered
wrong,
and
knew
nothing
about
the
two
last
teeth.
"I
sometimes
feel
sorry
I'm
so
superfluous
here,"
said
Anna,
going
out
of
the
nursery
and
holding
up
her
skirt
so
as
to
escape
the
plaything
standing
in
the
doorway.
"It
was
very
different
with
my
first
child."
"I
expected
it
to
be
the
other
way,"
said
Darya
Alexei
shyly.
"Oh,
no!
By
the
way,
do
you
know
I
saw
Sesa
said
Anna,
screwing
up
her
eyes,
as
though
looking
at
something
far
away.
"But
we'll
talk
about
that
later.
You
wouldn't
believe

Princess

gave

a
cordial
and

began
at
once

to
her
that

that

it

to
help
her
in
this
most
difficult
period

had

men
of

returned
with

and

off
to

bathing
place,
promising
to
get
the

ready
and
to
wait
there
for

They
walked
along
the
path
in
two
couples,
Anna
with
Svider.
and
Dolly
with
Vrye
Dolly
was

little
embarrassed
and
anxious
in
the
new
surroundings
in
which
she
found
herself.
Abstracts

she
did
not
merely
justify,"
she
positively
approved
of
Anna's
conduct.
As
is
indeed

unimpeachable
virtue,
weary
of
the
monotony
of
respectable
existence,
at
a
distance
she
not
only
excused
illicit
love,
she
positively
envied
it.
Besides,
she
loved
Anna
with
all
her
heart.
But
seeing
Anna
in
actual
life
among
these
strangers,
with
this
fashionable
tone
that
was
so
new
to
Darya
Alexei
she
felt
ill
at
ease.
What
she
disliked
particularly
was
seeing
Princess
Varvara
ready
to
overlook
everything
for
the
sake
of
the
comforts
she
enjoyed.
As
a
general
principle,
abstracts
Dolly
approved
of
Anna's
action;
but
to
see
the
man
for
whose
sake
her
action
had
been
taken
was
disagreeable
to
her.
Moreover,
she
had
never
liked
Vrye
She
thought
him
very
proud,
and
saw
nothing
in
him
of
which
he
could
be
proud
except
his
wealth.
But
against
her
own
will,
here
in
his
own
house,
he
overawed
her
more
than
ever,
and
she
could
not
be
at
ease
with
him.
She
felt
with
him
the
same
feeling
she
had
had
with
the
maid
about
her
dressing
jacket.
Just
as
with
the
maid
she
had
felt
not
exactly
ashamed,
but
embarrassed
at
her
dart
so
she
felt
with
him
not
exactly
ashamed,
but
embarrassed
at
herself.
Dolly
was
ill
at
ease,
and
tried
to
find
a
subject
of
conversation.
Even
though
she
supposed
that,
through
his
pride,
praise
of
his
house
and
garden
would
be
sure
to
be
disagreeable
to
him,
she
did
all
the
same
tell
him
how
much
she
liked
his
house.
"Yes,
it's
a
very
fine
building,
and
in
the
good
old-fashioned
style,"
he
said.
"I
like
so
much
the
court
in
front
of
the
steps.
Was
that
always
so?"
"Oh,
no!"
he
said,
and
his
face
beamed
with
pleasure.
"If
you
could
only
have
seen
that
court
last
spring"
And
he
began,
at
first
rather
diffraction
but
more
and
more
carried
away
by
the
subject
as
he
went
on,
to
draw
her
attention
to
the
various
details
of
the
decoration
of
his
house
and
garden.
It
was
evident
that,
having
devoted
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
improve
and
beautify
his
home,
Vrye
felt
a
need
to
show
off
the
improvements
to
a
new
person,
and
was
genuinely
delighted
at
Darya
Alexei
praise.
"If
you
would
care
to
look
at
the
hospital,
and
are
not
tired,
indeed,
it's
not
far.
Shall
we
go?"
he
said,
glancing
into
her
face
to
convince
himself
that
she
was
not
bored.
"Are
you
coming,
Annaba
he
turned
to
her.
"We
will
come,
won't
we?"
she
said,
addressing
Svider.

said
Anna,
turning
to
Dolly
with
that
sly
smile
of
comprehension
with
which
she
had
previously
talked
about
the
hospital.
"Oh,
it's
a
work
of
real
importance"
said
Svider.
But
to
show
he
was
not
trying
to
ingratiate
himself
with
Vrye
he
promptly
added
some
slightly
critical
remarks.
"I
wonder,
though,

he
said,
"that
while
you
do
so
much
for
the
health
of
the
peasants,
you
take
so

in
the
schools."

he
said
to

pointing
to
a
turning
out
of
the
avenue.
The
ladies
put
up
their

and
turned
into
the

After
going
down

going
through

towards

to

he
stood
still
with

began

to
Anna,

had
asked
what
was
the

"I

said

was
expressing
his
surprise
at
her
knowledge
of

"This

ought
to
have
been
in

It
was
an
afterthought,
and
was
begun
without

Vrye
having
finished
his
talk
with
the
architect,
joined
the
ladies,
and
led
them
inside
the
hospital.
Although
they
were
still
at
work
on
the
cornices,
outside
and
were
painting
on
the

upstairs
almost
all
the
rooms
were
finished.
Going
up
the
broad
cast-iron
staircase
to
the
landing,
they
walked
into
the
first
large
room.
The
walls
were
stuck
to
look
like
marble,
the
huge
plate-glass
windows
were
already
in,
only
the
parquet

was
not

and
the
carpenters,
who
were

From

Then
he
showed

to

will

she
thought

times,
not
hearing
what
he
said,

looking
at
him
and
penetrating
into
his
expression,
while
she
mentally
put
herself
in

place.
She
liked

now

she
saw
how

to

"I

answered

rather
astonished.
She
saw
by
Vrye

that
he
wanted
something
from
her.
She
was
not

As
soon
as
they
had
passed
through

into

he
looked
in

he
began:

what
he
was
about
to
speak
of
to
her
flashed
into
her
brain.
"He
is
going
to
beg
me
to
come
to
stay
with
them
with
the
children,
and
I
shall
have
to
refused
or
to
create
a
set
that
will
receive
Anna
in
Moscow:
Or
isn't
it
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
and
his
relations
with
Annaba
Or
perhaps
about
Kitty,
that
he
feels
he
was
to
blame?"
All
her
conjectures
were
unpleasant,
but
she
did
not
guess
what
he
really
wanted
to
talk
about
to
her.
"You
have
so
much
influence
with
Anna,
she
is
so
fond
of
you,"
he
said;
"do
help
me."
Darya

looked
with
timid
inquiry
into
his
energetic
face,

was
continually
being
lighted
up
in
patches
by
the
sunshine,
and
then
passing
into
complete
shadow
again.
She
waited
for
him
to
say
more,
but
he
walked
in
silence
beside
her,
scratching
with
his
cane
in
the
gravel.
"You
have
come
to
see
us,
you,
the
only
woman
of
Anna's
former
friends.
don't
count
Princess
Varvares
I
know
that
you
have
done
this
not
because
you
regard
our
position
as
normal,
but
because,
understanding
all
the
difficulty
of
the
position,
you
still
love
her
and
want
to
be
a
help
to
her.
Have
I
understood
you
rightness
he
asked,
looking
round
at
her.
"Oh,
yes,"
answered
Darya
Alexei
putting
down
her
sunshine
null
"No,"
he
broke
in,
and
unconsciously,
oblivious
of
the
awkward
position
into
which
he
was
putting
his
companion,
he
stopped
abruptly,"
so
that
she
had
to
stop
short
too.
"No
one
feels
more
deeply
and
intensely
than
I
do
all
the
difficulty
of
Anna's
position;
and
that
you
may
well
understand,
if
you
do
me
the
honor
of
supposing
I
have
any
heart.
I
am
to
blame
for
that
position,
and
that
is
why
I
feel
it."
"I
understand,"
said
Darya
Alexei
involuntarily
admiring
the
sincerity
and
firmness
with
which
he
said
this.
"But
just
because
you
feel
yourself
responsible,
you
exaggerate
it,
I
am
afraid,"
she
said.
"Her
position
in
the
world
is
difficult,
I
can
well
understand."
"In
the
world
it
is
hell"
he
brought
out
quickly,
frowning
darkly.
"You
can't
imagine
moral
sufferings
greater
than
what
she
went
through
in
Petersburg
in
that
fortnight
...
and
I
beg
you
to
believe
it."

and
at

I
see
in
Anna
that
she
is
happy,
perfectly
happy,
she
has
had
time
to
tell
me
so
much
already,"
said
Darya
Alexei
smilingly
and
involuntarily,
as
she
said
this,
at
the
same
moment
a
doubt
entered
her
mind
whether
Anna
really
were
happy.
But
Vrye
it
appeared,
had
no
doubts
on
that
score.
"Yes,
yes,"
he
said,
"I
know
that
she
has
revived
after
all
her
suffers
she
is
happy.
She
is
happy
in
the
present.
But
IF
I
am
afraid
of
what
is
before
us
...
I
beg
your
pardon,
you
would
like
to
walk
on?"
"No,
I
don't
mind."
"Well,
then,
let
us
sit
here."
Darya
Alexei
sat
down
on
a
garden
seat
in
a
corner
of
the
avenue.
He
stood
up
facing
her.
"I
see
that
she
is
happy,"
he
repeated,
and
the
doubt
whether
she
were
happy
sank
more
deeply
into
Darya
Alexei
mind.
"But
can
it
last?
Whether
we
have
acted
rightly
or
wrongly
is
another
question,
but
the
die
is
cast,"
he
said,
passing
from
Russian
to
French,
"and
we
are
bound
together
for
life.
We
are
united
by
all
the
ties
of
love
that
we
hold
most
sacred.
We
have
a
child,
we
may
have
other
children.
But
the
law
and
all
the
conditions
of
our
position
are
such
that
thousands
of
complications
arise
which
she
does
not
see
and
does
not
want
to
see.
And
that
one
can
well
understand.
But
I
can't
help
seeing
them.
My
daughter
is
by
law
not
my
daughter,
but
Karenina
I
cannot
bear
this
falsity.
he
said,
with
a
vigorous
gesture
of
refusal,
and
he
looked
with
gloomy
inquiry
towards
Darya
Alexei
She
made
no
answer,
but
simply
gazed
at
him.
He
went
on:
"One
day
a
son
may
be
born,
my
son,
and
he
will
be
legally
a
Karenina
he
will
not
be
the
heir
of
my
name
nor
of
my
property,
and
however
happy
we
may
be
in
our
home
life
and
however
many
children
we
may
have,
there
will
be
no
real
tie
between
us.
They
will
be
Karennis
You
can
understand
the
bitterness
and
horror
of
this
position"
I
have
tried
to
speak
of
this
to
Anna.
It
irritates
her.
She
does
not
understand,
and
to
her
I
cannot
speak
plainly
of
all
this.
Now
look
at
another
side.
I
am
happy,
happy
in
her
love,
but
I
must
have
occupation.
I
have
found
occupation,
and
am
proud
of
what
I
am
doing
and
consider
it
nobler
than
the
pursuits
of
my
former
companions
at
court
and
in
the
army.
And
most
certainly
I
would
not
change
the
work
I
am
doing
for
theirs.
I
am
working
here,
settled
in
my
own
place,
and
I
am
happy
and
contented,
and
we
need
nothing
more
to
make
us
happy.
I
love
my
work
here.

the
contrary:
Darya
Alexei
noticed
that
at
this
point
in
his
explanation
he
grew
confused,
and
she
did
not
quite
understand
this
digressions
but
she
felt
that
having
once
begun
to
speak
of
matters
near
his
heart,
of
which
he
could
not
speak
to
Anna,
he
was
now
making
a
clean
breast
of
everything,
and
that
the
question
of
his
pursuits
in
the
country
fell
into
the
same
category
of
matters
near
his
heart,
as
the
question
of
his
relations
with
Anna.
"Well,
I
will
go
on,"
he
said,
collecting
himself.
"The
great
thing
is
that
as
I
work
I
want
to
have
a
conviction
that
what
I
am
doing
will
not

that

He
paused,
evidently
much
moved.
"Yes,
indeed,
I
see
that.
But
what
can
Anna
do?"
queried
Darya
Alexei
"Yes,
that
brings
me
to
the
object
of
my
conversation,"
he
said,
calming
himself
with
an
effort.
"Anna

And
now,
I

He
said
plainly
at
that
time

expressed
the

he
would
not

he
said

and

I
won't
speak
of
myself,
though
it's
hard
for
me,
very
hard,"
he
said,
with
an
expression
as
though
he
were
threatening
someone
for
its
being
hard
for
him.
"And
so
it
is,

"Yes,

dreamily:

she
vividly
recalled
her

interview
with

"Yes,

repeated
with

thinking
of

said
Darya
Alexei
and
for
some
reason
she
suddenly
at
that
point
recalled
Anna's
strange
new
habit
of
half-completed,
her
eyes.
And
she
remembered
that
Anna
drooped
her
eyelids
just
when
the
deeper
questions
of
life
were
touched
upon.
"Just
as
though
she

her

to

so

thought
Dolly.
"Yes,
indeed,
for
my
own
sake
and
for
hers
I
will
talk
to
her,"
Dolly
said
in
reply
to
his
look
of
gratitude.
They
got
up
and
walked
to
the
house.
Chapter
22
When
Anna
found
Dolly
at
home
before
her,
she
looked
intently
in
her
eyes,
as
though
questioning
her
about
the
talk
she
had
had
with
Vrye
but
she
made
no
inquiry
in
words.
"I
believe
it's
dinner
time,"
she
said.
"We've
not
seen
each
other
at
all
yet.
I
am
reckoning
on
the
evening.
Now
I
want
to
go
and
dress.
I
expect
you
do
too;
we
all
got
splashed
at
the
buildings."
Dolly
went
to
her
room
and
she
felt
amused.
To
change
her
dress
was
impossible,
for
she
had
already
put
on
her
best
dress.
But
in
order
to
signify
in
some
way
her
preparation
for
dinner,
she
asked
the
maid
to
brush
her
dress,
changed
her
cuffs
and
tie,
and
put
some
lace
on
her
head.
"This
is
all
I
can
do,"
she
said
with
a
smile
to
Anna,
who
came
in
to
her
in
a
third
dress,
again
of
extreme
simplicity.
"Yes,
we
are
too
formal
here,"
she
said,
as
it
were
apologizing
for
her
magnificence.
"Alias
is
delighted
at
your
visit,
as
he
rarely
is
at
anything.
He
has
completely
lost
his
heart
to
you,"
she
added.
"You're
not
tired?"
There
was
no
time
for
talking
about
anything
before
dinner.
Going
into
the
drawing
room
they
found
Princess
Varvara
already
there,
and

The

coat.

presented
the
doctor
and
the
steward
to
his
guest.
The
architect
he
had
already
introduced
to
her
at
the
hospital.
A
stout
butler,
resplendent
with
a
smoothly
shaven

chin
and
a
starched
white
cravated,
announced
that

was
before
Tushnet
in
offering
his
arm
to
Princess
Varvares
so
that
Tushnet
with
the
steward
and
the
doctor
walked
in
alone.
The
dinner,
the
dining
room,
the
service,
the
waiting
at
table,
the
wine,
and
the
food,
were
not
simply
in
keeping
with
the
general
tone
of
modern
luxury
throughout
all
the
house,
but
seemed
even
more
sumptuous
and
modern.
Darya
Alexei
watched
this
luxury
which
was
novel
to
her,
and
as
a
good
housekeeper
used
to
managing
a
household-cleaner
she
never
dreamed
of
adapting
anything
she
saw
to
her
own
household,
as
it
was
all
in
a
style
of
luxury
far
above
her
own
manner
of
living-cost
could
not
help
scrutinizing
every
detail,
and
wondering
how
and
by
whom
it
was
all
done.
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
her
husband,
and
even
Svider.
and
many
other
people
she
knew,
would
never
have
considered
this
question,
and
would
have
readily
believed
what
every
well-bred
host
tries
to
make
his
guests
feel,
that
is,
that
all
that
is
well-ordered
in
his
house
has
cost
him,
the
host,
no
trouble
whatever,
but
comes
of
itself.
Darya
Alexei
was
well
aware
that
even
porridge
for
the
children's
breakfast
does
not
come
of
itself,
and
that
therefore,
where
so
complicated
and
magnificent
a
style
of
luxury
was
maintained,
someone
must
give
earnest
attention
to
its
organization.
And
from
the
glance
with
which
Alexey

scanned
the
table,
from
the
way
he
nodded
to
the
butler,
and
offered
Darya
Alexei
her
choice
between
cold
soup
and
hot
soup,
she
saw
that
it
was
all
organized
and
maintained
by
the
care
of
the
master
of
the
house
himself.
It
was
evident
that
it
all
rested
no
more
upon
Anna
than
upon
VetFran,
She,
Svider.
the
princess,
and
VetFran,
were
equally
guests,
with
light
hearts
enjoying
what
had
been
arranged
for
them.
Anna
was
the
hostess
only
in
conducting
the
conversation.
The
conversation
was
a
difficult
one
for
the
lady
of
the
house
at
a
small
table
with
persons
present,
like
the
steward
and
the
architect,
belonging
to
a
completely
different
world,
struggling
not
to
be
overawed
by
an
elegance
to
which
they
were
unaccustomed.
and
unable
to
sustain
a
large
share
in
the
general
conversation.
But
this
difficult
conversation
Anna
directed
with
her
usual
tact
and
naturalness.
and
indeed
she
did
so
with
actual
enjoyment,"
as
Darya
Alexei
observed.
The
conversation
began
about
the
row
Tushnet
and
VetFran,
had
taken
alone
together
in
the
boat,
and
Tushnet
began
describing
the
last
boat
races
in
Petersburg
at
the
Yacht
Club.
But
Anna,
seizing
the
first
pause,
at
once
turned
to
the
architect
to
draw
him
out
of
his
silence.
"Nil
Ivano-Frankovsk
was
struck,"
she
said,
meaning
Svider.
"at
the
progress
the
new
building
had
made
since
he
was
here
last;
but
I
am
there
every
day,
and
every
day
I
wonder
at
the
rate
at
which
it
grows.'
"It's
first-rate
working
with
his
excellent
said
the
architect
with
a
smile
(he
was
respectful
and
composed,
though
with
a
sense
of
his
own
dignity,
"It's
a
very
different
matter
to
have
to
do
with
the
district
authorities.
Where
one
would
have
to
write
out
shenanigans
of
papers,
here
I
call
upon
the
count,
and
in
three
words
we
settle
the
business."
"The
American
way
of
doing
business,"
said
Svider.
with
a
smile.
"Yes,
there
they
build
in
a
rational
fashion/business/life
The
conversation
passed
to
the
misuse
of
political
power
in
the
United
States,
but
Anna
quickly
brought
it
round
to
another
topic,
so
as
to
draw
the
steward
into
talk.
"Have
you
ever
seen
a
reaping
machined
she
said,
addressing
Darya
Alexei
"We
had
just
ridden
over
to
look
at
one
when
we
met.
It's
the
first
time
I
ever
saw
one."
"How
do
they
work?"
asked
Dolly.
"Exactly
like
little
scissors.
A
plank
and
a
lot
of
little
scissors.
Like
this."
Anna
took
a
knife
and
fork
in
her
beautiful
white
hands
covered
with
rings,
and
began
showing
how
the
machine
worked.
It
was
clear
that
she
saw
nothing
would
be
understood
from
her
explanation?
but
aware
that
her
talk
was
pleasant
and
her
hands
beautiful
she
went
on
explaining.
"More
like
little
null
VetFran,
said
playfulness"
never
taking
his
eyes
off
her.
Anna
gave
a
just
perceptible
smile,
but
made
no
answer.
"Isn't
it
true,
Karl
Fedoriw
that
it's
just
like
little
sclarea
she
said
to
the
steward.
"`A

answered
the
German.
_"Inspector

and
he
began
to
explain
the
construction
of
the
machine.
"It's
a
pity
it
doesn't
bind
too.
I
saw
one
at
the
Vienna
exhibition,
which
binds
with
a

turned
to

Darya
Alexei
saw
that
Anna
disliked
the
tone
of

that
existed
between
her
and
VetFran,
but
fell
in
with
it
against
her
will.

acted
in
this
matter
quite
differently
from
Levin.

obviously
attached
no
significance
to

who

in
gloomy

kept
up
a
conversation
that
never
paused,
glancing
off
one
subject,
fastening
on
another,
and
at
times
stinging
one
or
the
other
to
the
quick.
Once

to

so

wondered

VetFran,
said,
turning
to
Anna
with
a
smile.
"I
can't

Darya
Alexei
said,
firing
up;
"but
I
can
say
that
he's
a
highly
cultivated
man,
and
if

"I
know
no

more
strict
in
the
performance
of
his

said
Darya
Alexei
irritated
by
Vrye
tone
of
superiority.
"For
my
part,"
pursued
Vrye
who
was
evidently
for
some
reason
or
other
keenly
affected
by
this
conversation,
"such
as
I
am,
I
am,
on
the
contrary,
extremely
grateful
for
the
honor
they
have
done
me,

to

indicated
Svider.
"in

consider
that
for

the
duty
of
being
present
at
the

of
judging
some
peasants'
quarrel
about
a
horse,
is
as
important
as
anything
I
can
do.
And
I
shall
regard
it
as
an
honor
if
they
elect
me
for

It's
only
in
that
way
I
can
pay
for

I
enjoy
as
a

Unmaking
they
don't
understand
the
weight
that
the

to
have

It
was
strange
to
Darya
Alexei
to
hear
how
serenely
confident
he
was
of
being
right
at
his
own
table.
She
thought
how
Levin,
who
believed
the
opposite,
was
just
as
positive
in
his
opinions
at
his
own
table.
But
she
loved
Levin,
and
so
she
was
on
his
side.
"So
we
can
reckon
upon
you,
count,
for
the
coming
elections?"
said
Svider.
"But
you
must
come
a
little
beforehand,
so
as
to
be
on
the
spot
by
the
eighth.
If
you
would
do
me
the
honor
to
stop
with
me."
"I
rather
agree
with
your
beau.
said
Anna,
"though
not
quite
on
the
same
ground
as
he,"
she
added
with
a
smile.
"I'm
afraid
that
we
have
too
many
of
these
public
duties
in
these
latter
days.
Just
as
in
old
days
there
were
so
many
government
functionaries
that
one
had
to
call
in
a
functionary
for
every
single
thing,
so
now
everyone's
doing
some
sort
of
public
duty.
Alexey
has
been
here
now
six

and
he's
a
member,
I
do
believe,
of
five

Anna
spoke
lightly,
but
irritation
could
be
discerned
in
her
tone.
Darya
Alexei
watching
Anna
and
Vrye
attentively,
detected
it
instantly.
She
noticed,
too,
that
as
she
spoke
Vrye
face
had
immediately
taken
a
serious
and
obstinate
expression.
Noticing
this,
and
that
Princess
Varvara
at
once
made
haste
to
change
the
conversation
by
talking
of
Petersburg
acquaintances,
and
remembering
what
Vrye
had
without
apparent
connection
said
in
the
garden
of
his
work
in
the
country,
Dolly
surmised
that
this
question
of
public
activity
was
connected
with
some
deep
private
disagreement
between
Anna
and
Vrye
The
dinner,
the
wine,
the
decoration
of
the
table
were
all
very
good;
but
it
was
all
like
what
Darya
Alexei
had
seen
at
formal
dinners
and
balls
which
of
late
years
had
become
quite
unfamiliar
to
her;
it
all
had
the
same
impersonal
and
constrained
character,
and
so
on
an
ordinary
day
and
in
a
little
circle
of
friends
it
made
a
disagreeable
impression
on
her.
After
dinner
they
sat
on
the
terrace,
then
they
proceeded
to
play
lawn
tennis.
The
players,
divided
into
two
parties,
stood
on
opposite
sides
of
a
tightly
drawn
net
with
gilt
poles
on
the
carefully
leveled
and
rolled
croquet.
Darya
Alexei
made
an
attempt
to
play,
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
could
understand
the
game,
and
by
the
time
she
did
understand
it,
she
was
so
tired
that
she
sat
down
with
Princess
Varvara
and
simply
looked
on
at
the
players.
Her
partner,
Tushnet
gave
up
playing
too,
but
the
others
kept
the
game
up
for
a
long
time.
Svider.
and
Vrye
both
played
very
well
and
seriously.
They
kept
a
sharp
lookout
on
the
balls
served
to
them,
and
without
haste
or
getting
in
each
other's
way,
they
ran
adroitly
up
to
them,
waited
for
the
rebound,
and
neatly
and
accurately
returned
them
over
the
net.
VetFran,
played
worse
than
the
others.
He
was
too
eager,
but
he
kept
the
players
lively
with
his
high
spirits.
His
laughter
and
outcries
never
paused.
Like
the
other
men
of
the
party,
with
the
ladies'
permission,
he
took
off
his
coat,
and
his
solid,
comely
figure
in
his
white
shirt.
with
his
red
perspiring
face
and
his
impulsive
movements,
made
a
picture
that
imprinted
itself
vividly
on
the
memory.
When
Darya
Alexei
lay
in
bed
that
night,
as
soon
as
she
closed
her
eyes,
she
saw
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
flying
about
the
croquet
ground.
During
the
game
Darya
Alexei
was
not
enjoying
herself.
She
did
not
like
the
light
tone
of
railman
that
was
kept
up
all
the
time
between
Vassilatos,
VetFran,
and
Anna,
and
the
null
altogether
of
grown-up
people,
all
alone
without
children,
playing
at
a
child's
game.
But
to
avoid
breaking
up
the
party
and
to
get
through
the
time
somehow,
after
a
rest
she
joined
the
game
again,
and
pretended
to
be
enjoying
it.
All
that
day
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
she
were
acting
in
a
theater
with
actors
cleverer
than
she,
and
that
her
bad
acting
was
spoiling
the
whole
performance.
She
had
come
with
the
intention
of
staying
two
days,
if
all
went
well.
But
in
the
evening,
during
the
game,
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
go
home
next
day.
The
maternal
cares
and
worries,
which
she
had
so
hated
on
the
way,
now,
after
a
day
spent
without
them,
struck
her
in
quite
another
light,
and
tempted
her
back
to
them.
When,
after
evening
tea
and
a
row
by
night
in
the
boat,
Darya
Alexei
went
alone
to
her
room,
took
off
her
dress,
and
began
arranging
her
thin
hair
for
the
night,
she
had
a
great
sense
of
relief.
It
was
positively
disagreeable
to
her
to
think
that
Anna
was
coming
to
see
her
immediately.
She
longed
to
be
alone
with
her
own
thoughts.
Chapter
23
Dolly
was
wanting
to
go
to
bed
when
Anna
came
in
to
see
her,
attired
for
the
night.
In
the
course
of
the
day
Anna
had
several
times
begun
to
speak
of
matters
near
her
heart,
and
every
time
after
a
few
words
she
had
stopped;
"Afterwards,
by
ourselves,
we'll
talk
about
everything.
I've
got
so
much
I
want
to
tell
you,"
she
said.
Now
they
were
by
themselves,
and
Anna
did
not
know
what
to
talk
about.
She
sat
in
the
window
looking
at
Dolly,
and
going
over
in
her
own
mind
all
the
stores
of
intimate
talk
which
had
seemed
so
inexhaustible
beforehand,
and
she
found
nothing.
At
that
moment
it
seemed
to
her
that
everything
had
been
said
already.
"Well,
what
of
Kittyhawk
she
said
with
a
heavy
sigh,
looking
penitents
at
Dolly.
"Tell
me
the
truth,
Dollywood
isn't
she
angry
with
me?"
"Anheuser
Oh,
no!"
said
Darya
Alexei
smiling.
"But
she
hates
me,
despises
me?"
"Oh,
no!
But
you
know
that
sort
of
thing
isn't
forgiven."
"Yes,
yes,"
said
Anna,
turning
away
and
looking
out
of
the
open
window.
"But
I
was
not
to
blame.
And
who
is
to
blame?
What's
the
meaning
of
being
to
blame?
Could
it
have
been
otherwise?
What
do
you
think?
Could
it
possibly
have
happened
that
you
didn't
become
the
wife
of
Stivaletti
"Really,
I
don't
know.
But
this
is
what
I
want
you
to
tell
me:
"Yes,
yes,
but
we've
not
finished
about
Kitty.
Is
she
happy?
He's
a
very
nice
man,
they
say."
"He's
much
more
than
very
nice.
I
don't
know
a
better
man."
"Ah,
how
glad
I
am!"
I'm
so
glade
Much
more
than
very
nice,"
she
repeated.
Dolly
smiled.
"But
tell
me
about
yourself.
We've
a
great
deal
to
talk
about.
And
I've
had

Dolly
did
not
know
what
to
call
him.
She
felt
it
awkward
to
call
him
either
the
count
or
Alexey
Kirilov.
"With
Alexeyev
said
Anna,
"I
know
what
you
talked
about.
But
I
wanted
to
ask
you
directly
what
you
think
of
me,
of
my
life?"
"How
am
I
to
say
like
that
straight
off?
I
really
don't
know."
"No,
tell
me
all
the
same:
You
see
my
life.
But
you
mustn't
forget
that
you're
seeing
us
in
the
summer,
when
you
have
come
to
us
and
we
are
not
alone:
But
we
came
here
early
in
the
spring,
lived
quite
alone,
and
shall
be
alone
again,
and
I
desire
nothing
better.
But
imagine
me
living
alone
without
him,
alone,
and
that
will
be
...
I
see
by
everything
that
it
will
often
be
repeated,
that
he
will
be
half
the
time
away
from
home,"
she
said,
getting
up
and
sitting
down
close
by
Dolly.
"Of
course,"
she
interrupted
Dolly,
who
would
have
answered,
"of
course
I
won't
try
to
keep
him
by
force.
I
don't
keep
him
indeed.
The
races
are
just
coming,
his
horses
are
running,
he
will
go.
I'm

But
think
of
me,
fancy
my
position:
But
what's
the
use
of
talking
about
it?"
She
smiled.
"Well,
what
did
he
talk
about
with
you?"
"He
spoke
of
what
I
want
to
speak
about
of
myself,
and
it's
easy
for
me
to
be
his
advocate;

not
trouble
on
that
score;
I
shall
have
no
more

"How
can
you
tell
that
you
won'tbe
"I
shall
not,
because
I
don't
wish
it."
And,
in
spite
of
all
her
emotion,
Anna
smiled,
as
she
caught
the
naive
expression
of
curiosity,
wonder,
and
horror
on
Dolly,
face.
"The
doctor
told
me
after
my
illness:
"Impossible,"
said
Dolly,
opening
her
eyes
wide.
For
her
this
was
one
of
those
discoveries
the
consequences
and
deductions
from
which
are
so
immense
that
all
that
one
feels
for
the
first
instant
is
that
it
is
impossible
to
take
it
all
in,
and
that
one
will
have
to
reflect
a
great,
great
deal
upon
it.
This
discovery,
suddenly
throwing
light
on
all
those
families
of
one
or
two
children,
which
had
hitherto
been
so
incomprehensible
to
her,
aroused
so
many
ideas,
reflections,
and
contradictory
emotions,
that
she
had
nothing
to
say,
and
simply
gazed
with
wide-open
eyes
of
wonder
at
Anna.
This
was
the
very
thing
she
had
been
dreaming
of,
but
now
learning
that
it
was
possible,
she
was
horrified."
She
felt
that
it
was
too
simple
a
solution
of
too
complicated
a
problem.
_"Off

immorality
was
all
she
said,
after
a
brief
pause.
"Why
so?
Think,
I
have
a
choice
between
two
alternatives:
either
to
be
with
child,
that
is
an
invalid,
or
to
be
the
friend
and
companion
of
my
husband-and-wife
my
husband,"
Anna
said
in
a
tone
intentionally
superficial
and
frivolous.
"Yes,
yes,"
said
Darya
Alexei
hearing
the
very
arguments
she
had
used
to
herself,
and
not
finding
the
same
force
in
them
as
before.
"For
you,
for
other
people,"
said
Anna,
as
though
divining
her
thoughts,
"there
may
be
reason
to

for
me:

as

And
how
am
I
to
keep

Not

this!"'
She
moved
her
white
hands
in
a
curve
before
her
waist
with
extraordinary
rapidly
as
happens
during
moments
of
excitement?
ideas
and
memories
rushed
into
Darya
Alexei
head.
"I,"
she
thought,
"did
not
keep
my
attraction
for
Stivaletti
he
left
me
for
others,
and
the
first
woman
for
whom
he
betrayed
me
did
not
keep
him
by
being
always
pretty
and
lively.
He
deserted
her
and
took
another.
And
can
Anna
attract
and
keep
Count
Vrye
in
that
way?
If
that
is
what
he
looks
for,
he
will
find
dresses
and
manners
still
more
attractive
and
charming.
And
however
white
and
beautiful
her
bare
arms
are,
however
beautiful
her
full
figure
and
her
eager
face
under
her
black
curls,
he
will
find
something
better
still,
just
as
my
disgusting,
pitiful,"
and
charming
husband
does."
Dolly
made
no
answer,
she
merely
sighed.
Anna
noticed
this
sigh,
indicating
dissent,
and
she
went
on.
In
her
armory
she
had
other
arguments
so
strong
that
no
answer
could
be
made
to
them.
"Do
you
say
that
it's
not
right?
But
you
must
consider,"
she
went
on;
"you
forget
my
position.
How
can
I
desire
children?
I'm
not
speaking
of
the
suffering,
I'm
not
afraid
of
that.
Think
only,
what
are
my
children
to
be?
Ill-fed,
children,
who
will
have
to
bear
a
stranger's
name.
For
the
very
fact
of
their
birth
they
will
be
forced
to
be
ashamed
of
their
mother,
their
father,
their
birth."
"But
that
is
just
why
a
divorce
is
necessary."
But
Anna
did
not
hear
her.
She
longed
to
give
utterance
to
all
the
arguments
with
which
she
had
so
many
times
convinced
herself.
"What
is
reason
given
me
for,
if
I
am
not
to
use
it
to
avoid
bringing
unhappy
beings
into
the
world!"
She
looked
at
Dolly,
but
without
waiting
for
a
reply
she
went
on:
"I
should
always
feel
I
had
wronged
these
unhappy
children,"
she
said.
"If
they
are
not,
at
any
rate
they
are
not
unhappy`crowd
while
if
they
are
unhappy,
I
alone
should
be
to
blame
for
it."
These
were
the
very
arguments
Darya
Alexei
had
used
in
her
own
reflective
but
she
heard
them
without
understanding
them.
"How
can
one
wrong
creatures
that
don't
exist?"
she
thought.
And
all
at
once
the
idea
struck
her:
could
it
possibly,
under
any
circumstances,
have
been
better
for
her
favorite
Grisham
if
he
had
never
existence
And
this
seemed
to
her
so
wild,
so
strange,
that
she
shook
her
head
to
drive
away
this
tangle
of
whirling-dervish
mad
ideas.
"No,
I
don't
know;
it's
not
right,"
was
all
she
said,
with
an
expression
of
disgust
on
her
face.
"Yes,
but
you
mustn't
forget
that
you
and
I.A.
And
besides
that,"
added
Anna,
in
spite
of
the
wealth
of
her
arguments
and
the
poverty
of
Dolly,
objections,
seeming
still
to
admit
that
it
was
not
right,
"don't
forget
the
chief
point,
that
I
am
not
now
in
the
same
position
as
you.
For
you
the
question
is:
do
you
desire
not
to
have
any
more
children;
while
for
me
it
is:
do
I
desire
to
have
them?
And
that's
a
great
difference.
You
must
see
that
I
can't
desire
it
in
my
position."
Darya
Alexei
made
no
reply.
She
suddenly
felt
that
she
had
got
far
away
from
Annaba
that
there
lay
between
them
a
barrier
of
questions
on
which
they
could
never
agree,
and
about
which
it
was
better
not
to
speak.

"Then

all
the
more
reason
for
you
to
legalize

position,
if
possible,"
said
Dolly.
"Yes,
if

said
Anna,
speaking
all
at
once
in
an
utterly
different
tone,
subdued
and
mournful.
"Surely

Darya
Alexei
hastened
to
say,
noticing
the
expression
of
suffering
on
Anna's
face.
"All
I
see
is
that

"But

"But

Nothing.

to

I

about

I
don't
think
about

she
repeated,
and
a
flush
rose
into
her
face.
She
got
up,
straightening
her
chest,
and
sighed
heavily.
With
her
light
step
she
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
room,
stopping
now
and
then.
"I
don't
think
of
it?
Not

not

now."
Darya
Alexei
sitting
erect
on
a
chair,
turned
her
head,
following
Anna
with
a
face
of
sympathetic
suffering.
"You
ought
to
make
the
attempt,"
she
said
softly.
"Suppose
I
make
the
attempt.
What
does
it
mean?"
she
said,
evidently
giving
utterance
to
a
thought,
a
thousand
times
thought
over
and
learned
by
heart.
"It

at

there,

She
came
out
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
stood
facing
Dolly,
with
her
arms
pressed
tightly
across
her
chest.
In
her
white
dressing
gown
her
figure
seemed
more
than
usually
grand
and
broad.
She
bent
her
head,
and
with
shining.
wet
eyes
looked
from
under
her
brows
at
Dolly,
a
thin
little
pitiful
figure
in
her
patched
dressing
jacket
and
nightclothes,
shaking
all
over
with
emotion.
"It
is
only
those
two
creatures
that
I
love,
and
one
excludes
the
other.
I
can't
have
them
together,
and
that's
the
only
thing
I
want.
And
since
I
can't
have
that,
I
don't
care
about
the
rest.
I
don't
care
about
anything,
anything.
And
it
will
end
one
way
or
another,
and
so
I
can't,
I
don't
like
to
talk
of
it.
So
don't
blame
me,
don't
judge
me
for
anything.
You
can't
with
your
pure
heart
understand
all
that
I'm
suffering."
She
went
up,
sat
down
beside
Dolly,
and
with
a
guilty
look,
peepers
into
her
face
and
took
her
hand.
"What
are
you
thinking?
What
are
you
thinking
about
me?
Don't
despise
me.
I
don't
deserve
contempt.
I'm
simply
unhappy.
If
anyone
is
unhappy,
I
am,"
she
articulately.
and
turning
away,
she
burst
into
tears.
Left
alone,
Darya
Alexei
said
her
prayers
and
went
to
bed.
She
had
felt
for
Anna
with
all
her
heart
while
she
was
speaking
to
her,
but
now
she
could
not
force
herself
to
think
of
her.
The
memories
of
home
and
of
her
children
rose
up
in
her
imagination
with
a
peculiar
charm
quite
new
to
her,
with
a
sort
of
new
brilliance.
That
world
of
her
own
seemed
to
her
now
so
sweet
and
precious
that
she
would
not
on
any
account
spend
an
extra
day
outside
it,
and
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
certainly
go
back
next
day.
Anna
meantime
went
back
to
her
boudoir,
took
a
wine
glass
and
dropped
into
it
several
drops
of
a
medicine,
of
which
the
principal
ingredient
was
morphine.
After
drinking
it
off
and
sitting
still
a
little
while,
she
went
into
her
bedroom
in
a
soothed
and
more
cheerful
frame
of
mind.
When
she
went
into
the
bedroom,
Vrye
looked
intently
at
her.
He
was
looking
for
traces
of
the
conversation
which
he
knew
that,
staying
so
long
in
Dolly,
room,
she
must
have
had
with
her.
But
in
her
expression
of
restrained
excitement,
and
of
a
sort
of
reserve,
he
could
find
nothing
but
the
beauty
that
always
bewitching
him
afresh
though
he
was
used
to
it,
the
consciousness
of
it,
and
the
desire
that
it
should
affect
him.
He
did
not
want
to
ask
her
what
they
had
been
talking
of,
but
he
hoped
that
she
would
tell
him
something
of
her
own
accord.
But
she
only
said:
"I
am
so
glad
you
like
Dolly.
You
do,
don't
you?"
"Oh,
I've
known
her
a
long
while,
you
know.
She's
very
good-hearted.
I
suppose,
_may
excessiveness"
terrestrial
Still,
I'm
very
glad
to
see
her."
He
took
Anna's
hand
and
looked
inquiry
into
her
eyes.
Misiones
the
look,
she
smiled
to
him.
Next
morning,
in
spite
of
the
protests
of
her
hosts,
Darya
Alexei
prepared
for
her
homeward
journey.
Levin's
coachman,
in
his
by
no
means
new
coat
and
shabby
hat,
with
his
ill-matched
horses
and
his
coach
with
the
patched
mud-hut
drove
with
gloomy
determination
into
the
covered
gravel
approach.
Darya
Alexei
disliked
taking
leave
of
Princess
Varvara
and
the
gentlemen
of
the
party.
After
a
day
spent
together,
both
she
and
her
hosts
were
distinctly
aware
that
they
did
not
get
on
together,
and
that
it
was
better
for
them
not
to
meet.
Only
Anna
was
sad.
She
knew
that
now,
from
Dolly,
departure,
no
one
again
would
stir
up
within
her
soul
the
feelings
that
had
been
roused
by
their
conversation.
It
hurt
her
to
stir
up
these
feelings,
but
yet
she
knew
that
that
was
the
best
part
of
her
soul,
and
that
that
part
of
her
soul
would
quickly
be
smothered
in
the
life
she
was
leading.
As
she
drove
out
into
the
open
country,
Darya
Alexei
had
a
delightful
sense
of
relief,
and
she
felt
tempted
to
ask
the
two
men
how
they
had
liked
being
at
Vrye
when
suddenly
the
coachman,
Philip,
expressed
himself

had

her,
of
the
luxury
and
good

in
which
the
Vrye
lived,
and
of
their

and
she
would
not

a

to

them.

of
dissatisfaction
and
awkwardness
she
had
experienced
there.

Vrye
and
Anna
spent
the
whole
summer
and
part
of
the
winter
in
the
country,
living
in
just
the
same
condition,
and
still
taking
no
steps
to
obtain
a
divorce.
It
was
an
understood
thing
between
them
that
they
should
not
go
away
anywhre
but
both
felt,
the
longer
they
lived
alone,
especially
in
the
autumn,
without
guests
in
the
house,
that
they
could
not
stand
this
existence,
and
that
they
would
have
to
alter
it.
Their
life
was
apparently
such
that
nothing
better
could
be
desired.
They
had
the
fullest
abundance
of
everything;
they
had
a
child,
and
both
had
occupation.
Anna
devoted
just
as
much
care
to
her
appearance
when
they
had
no
visitors,
and
she
did
a
great
deal
of
reading,
both
of
novels
and
of
what
serious
literature
was
in
fashion.
She
ordered
all
the
books
that
were
praised
in
the
foreign
papers
and
reviews
she
received,
and

which
is
only
given
to
what
is
read
in
seclusion.
Moreover,
every
subject
that
was
of
interest
to
Vrye
she
studied
in
books
and
special
journals,
so
that
he
often
went
straight
to
her
with
questions
relating
to
agriculture
or
architecture,
sometimes
even
with
questions
relating
to
horse-breeding
or
sport.
He
was
amazed
at
her
knowledge,
her
memory,
and
at
first
was
disposed
to
doubt
it,
to
ask
for
confirmation
of
her
factual
and
she
would
find
what
he
asked
for
in
some
book,
and
show
it
to
him.
The
building
of
the
hospital,
too,
interested
her.
She
did
not
merely
assist,
but
planned
and
suggested
a
great
deal
herself.
But
her
chief
thought
was
still
of
herself.
far
she
was
dear
to
Vrye
how
far
she
could
make
up
to
him
for
all
he
had
given
up.
Vrye
appreciated
this
desire
not
only
to
please,
but
to
serve
him,
which
had
become
the
sole
aim
of
her
existence,
but
at
the
same
time
he
wearied
of
the
loving
snares
in
which
she
tried
to
hold
him
fast.
As
time
went
on,
and
he
saw
himself
more
and
more
often
held
fast
in
these
snares,
he
had
an
ever
growing
desire,
not
so
much
to
escape
from
them,
as
to
try
whether
they
hindered
his
freedom.
Had
it
not
been
for
this
growing
desire
to
be
free,
not
to
have
scenes
every
time
he
wanted
to
go
to
the
town
to
a
meeting
or
a
race,
Vrye
would
have
been
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
life.
The
role
he
had
taken
up,
the
role
of
a
wealthy
landowner,
one
of
that
class
which
ought
to
be
the
very
heart
of
the
Russian
aristocracy,
was
entirely
to
his
taste;
and
now,
after
spending
six
months
in
that
character,
he
derived
even
greater
satisfaction
from
it.
And
his
management
of
his
estate,
which
occupied
and
absorbed
him
more
and
more,
was
most
successful.
In
spite
of
the
immense
sums
cost
him
by
the
hospital,
by
machinery,
by
cows
ordered
from
Switzerland,
and
many
other
things,
he
was
convinced
that
he
was
not
wasting.
but
increasing
his
substance.
In
all
matters
affecting
income,
the
sales
of
timber,
wheat,
and
wool,
the
letting
of
lands,
Vrye
was
hard
as
a
rock,
and
knew
well
how
to
keep
up
prices.
In
all
operations
on
a
large
scale
on
this
and
his
other
estates,
he
kept
to
the
simplest
methods
involving
no
risk,
and
in
trifling
details
he
was
careful
and
exacting
to
an
extreme
degree.
In
spite
of
all
the
cunning
and
ingenuity
of
the
German
steward,
who
would
try
to
tempt
him
into
purchases
by
making
his
original
estimate
always
far
larger
than
really
required,
and
then
representing
to
Vrye
that
he
might
get
the
thing
cheaper,
and
so
make
a
profit,
Vrye
did
not
give
in.
He
listened
to
his
steward,
cross-examined
him,
and
only
agreed
to
his
suggestions
when
the
implement
to
be
ordered
or
constructed
was
the
very
newest,
not
yet
known
in
Russia,
and
likely
to
excite
wonder.
Apart
from
such
exceptions,
he
resolved
upon
an
increased
outlay
only
where
there
was
a
surplus,
and
in
making
such
an
outlay
he
went
into
the
minutest
details,
and
insisted
on
getting
the
very
best
for
his
money;
so
that
by
the
method
on
which
he
managed
his
affairs,
it
was
clear
that
he
was
not
wasting.

increasing

In

These

were
attracting

attention
from
several
circumstances
connected
with
them,
and
also
from
the
people
taking
part
in
them.
There
had
been
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
them,
and
great
preparations
were
being
made
for
them.
Persons
who
never

coming

On
the
day
before
there
had
been
almost
a
quarrel
between
Vrye
and
Anna
over
this
proposed
expedition.
It
was
the
very
dullest
autumn
weather,
which
is
so
dreary
in
the
country,
and
so,
preparing
himself
for
a
struggle,
Vrye
with
a
hard
and
cold
expression,
informed
Anna
of
his
departure
as
he
had
never
spoken
to
her
before.
But,
to
his
surprise,
Anna
accepted
the
information
with
great
composure,
and
merely
asked
when
he
would
be
back.
He
looked
intently
at
her,
at
a
loss
to
explain
this
composure.
She
smiled
at
his
look.
He
knew
that
way
she
had
of
withdrawing
into
herself,
and
knew
that
it
only
happened
when
she
had
determined
upon
something
without
letting
him
know
her
plans.
He
was
afraid
of
this;
but
he
was
so
anxious
to
avoid
a
scene
that
he
kept
up
appearances,
and
half
sincerely
believed
in
what
he
longed
to
believe
in-House
reasonableness.'
"I
hope
you
won't
be
dullards
"I
hope
not,"
said
Anna.
"I
got
a
box
of
books
yesterday
from
Gautier,
No,
I
shan't
be
dullards
"She's
trying
to
take
that
tone,
and
so
much
the
better,"
he
thought,
"or
else
it
would
be
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again."
And
he
set
off
for
the
elections
without
appealing
to
her
for
a
candid
explanation.
It
was
the
first
time
since
the
beginning
of
their
intimacy
that
he
had
parted
from
her
without
a
full
explanation.
From
one
point
of
view
this
troubled
him,
but
on
the
other
side
he
felt
that
it
was
better
so.
"At
first
there
will
be,
as
this
time,
something
undefined
kept
back,
and
then
she
will
get
used
to
it.
In
any
case
I
can
give
up
anything
for
her,
but
not
my
masculine
independence,"
he
thought.

ready
to
set

to
the
elections.
He
invited
his
brother,
who
had
a

in
the
Seleznov

to
come
with
him.
Levin
had,
moreover,
to

important
business
relating
to
the
ware
of

and
to
the
receiving
of

for
his
sister,
who
was
abroad.
Levin
still
hesitated,

and
urged

And
that
seven
pounds
paid
for

the
chief
cause
that
finally
decided
Levin
to
go.
He
went
to

Levin
had
been
six
days
in

the
assembly
each

and
busily
engaged
about

business,
which
still
dragged
on.
The

marshals
of

were
all
occupied
with
the
elections,
and
it
was
impossible
to
get
the
simplest
thing

depended
upon
the
court

The
other
matter,
the
payment
of
the
sums
due,
was
met
too
by
difficulties.
After
long
negotiations
over
the
legal
details,
the
money
was
at
last
ready
to
be
paid;
but
the
notary,
a
most
obliging
person,
could
not
hand
over
the
order,
because
it
must

and

but

in
dreams
when
one
tries
to
use
physical
force.
He
felt
this
frequently
as
he
talked
to
his
most
good-natured
solicitor.
This
solicitor
did,
it
seemed,
everything
possible,
and
strained
every
nerve
to
get
him
out
of
his
difficulties.
"I
tell
you
what
you
might
try,"
he
said
more
than
once;
"go
to
so-and-so
and
so-and-so.'
and
the
solicitor
drew
up
a
regular
plan
for
getting
round
the
fatal
point
that
hindered
everything.
But
he
would
add
immediately,
"It'll
mean
some
delay,
anyway,
but
you
might
try
it."
And
Levin
did
try,
and
did
go.
Everyone
was
kind
and
civil,
but
the
point
evaded
seemed
to
crop
up
again
in
the
end,
and
again
to
bar
the
way.
What
was
particularly
trying,
was
that
Levin
could
not
make
out
with
whom
he
was
struggling,
to
whose
interest
it
was
that
his
business
should
not
be
done.
That
no
one
seemed
to
know;
the
solicitor
certainly
did
not
know.
If
Levin
could
have
understood
why,
just
as
he
saw
why
one
can
only
approach
the
booking
office
of
a
railway
station
in
single
file,
it
would
not
have
been
so
vexatious
and
tiresome
to
him.
But
with
the
hindrances
that
confronted
him
in
his
business,
no
one
could
explain
why
they
existed.
But
Levin
had
changed
a
good
deal
since
his
marriage;
he
was
patient,
and
if
he
could
not
see
why
it
was
all
arranged
like
this,
he
told
himself
that
he
could
not
judge
without
knowing
all
about
it,
and
that
most
likely
it
must
be
so,
and
he
tried
not
to
fret.
In
attending
the
elections,
too,
and
taking
part
in
them,
he
tried
now
not
to
judge,
not
to
fall
foul
of
them,
but
to
comprehend
as
fully
as
he
could
the
question
which
was
so
earnestly
and
ardently

and
excellent

he
respected.
Since
his
marriage
there
had
been
revealed
to
Levin
so
many
new
and
serious
aspects
of
life
that
had
previously,
through
his
frivolous
attitude
to
them,
seemed
of
no
importance,
that
in
the
question
of
the
elections
too
he
assumed
and
tried
to
find
some
serious
significance.

a
good-hearted
man,
honest
after
his
own
fashion,
but
utterly
without
any
comprehension
of
the
needs
of
modern
days.
He
always
took,
in
every
question,
the
side
of
the

he
was
positively
antagonistic
to
the
spread
of
popular
education,
and
he
succeeded
in
giving
a
purely
party
character
to
the
district
council
which
ought
by
rights
to
be
of
such
an
immense
importance.
What
was
needed
was
to
put
in
his
place
a
fresh,
capable,
perfectly
modern
man,
of
contemporary
ideas,
and
to
frame
their
policy
so

could
possibly

In

always
took
the

of

there
was
now
such
a
preponderance

forces
that
this
policy,
once
carried
through
properly
there,
might
serve
as
a
model
for
other
provinces
for
all
Russia.
And
hence
the
whole
question
was
of
the
greatest
importance.
It
was
proposed
to

meeting
was
opened
by
the
governor,
who
made
a
speech
to
the
null
urging
them
to
elect
the
public

not
from

province
would,
as
at
all

elections,
hold
their
duty
as
sacred,
and
vindicate
the
exalted
confidence
of
the
monarch.
When
he
had

and
thronged
round
him
while
he
put
on
his

and
conversed
amicably
with

Levin,
anxious
to
see
into
everything
and
not
to
miss
anything,
stood
there
too
in
the
crowd,
and
heard
the
governor
say:
"Please
tell

is
very
sorry

And
thereupon

all
drove

felt
touched.

and
Levin,
busy
seeing
after
his
own
affairs,
did
not
attend
the
meetings.
On
the
fourth
day
the
auditing
of
the
marshal's
accounts
took
place
at
the
high
table
of
the
marshal
of
the
province.
And
then
there
occurred
the
first
skirmish
between
the
new
party
and
the
old.
The
committee
who
had
been
deputed
to
verify
the
accounts
reported
to
the
meeting
that
all
was
in
order.
The
marshal
of
the
province
got
up,
thanked
the
nobility
for
their
confidence,
and
shed
tears.
The
nobles
gave
him
a
loud
welcome,
and
shook
hands
with
him.

instant

said
that
he
had
heard
that

had
not

insult
to
the
marshal
of

One
of

Then
a
small

began
to
say
that
it
would
probably
be
agreeable
to
the

give
an
account

and
that
the
misplaced
delicacy
of
the
members
of
the
committee
was
depriving
him
of
this
moral
satisfaction.
Then
the

and
then
the
malignant
gentleman
again.
The
discussion
lasted
a
long
time
and
ended
in
nothing.
Levin
was
surprised
that
they
should
dispute
upon
this
subject
so
long,

as,
when
he
asked

Chapter
27
The
sixth
day
was
fixed
for
the
election
of
the
marshal
of
the
province.
The
rooms,
large
and
small,
were
full
of
noblemen
in
all
sorts
of
uniforms.
Many
had
come
only
for
that
day.
Men
who
had
not
seen
each
other
for
years,
some
from
the
Crimea,
some
from
Petersburg,
some
from
abroad,
met
in
the
rooms
of

and

from
the
silence
that
fell
upon
them
when
outsiders
approached
a
group,
and
from
the
way
that
some,
whispering
together,
retreated
to
the
farther
corridor,
it
was
evident
that
each
side
had
secrets
from
the
other.
In
appearance
the
noblemen
were
sharply
divided
into
two
classes:
the
old
and
the
new.
The
old
were
for
the
most
part
either
in
old
uniforms
of
the
nobility,

up
closely,
with
spurs
and
hats,

or
official
uniforms.
The
uniforms
of
the
older
men
were
embroidered
in
the
old-fashioned
way
with
epecially
on
their
shoulders;
they
were
unmistakably
tight
and
short
in
the
waist,
as
though
their
wearers
had
grown
out
of
them.
The
younger
men
wore

uniform
of

nobility
with
long

and
broad

and
with
the

of

To
the
younger
men

that
here
and
there
brightened
up
the
crowd.
But
the
division
into
young
and
old
did
not
correspond
with
the
division
of
parties.
Some
of
the
young
men,
as
Levin
observed,
belonged
to
the
old
party;
and
some
of
the
very
oldest
nobler
on
the
contrary,
were
whispering
with

and
were
evidently
ardent
partisans
of
the
new
party.
Levin
stood
in
the
smaller
room,
where
they
were
smoking
and
taking
light
refreshments.
close
to
his
own
friends,
and

to

they
were

he
added,
turning
to
Levin
and
drawing

arm
through

Levin
would
have
been
glad
indeed
to
be
converted,
but
could
not
make
out
what
the
point
was,
and
retreating
a
few
steps
from
the
speakers,
he
explained
to
Stepan
Arkalyk
his
inability
to
understand
why
the
marshal
of
the
province
should
be
asked
to
stand.
_"Off

said
Stepan
Arkalyk
and
briefly
and
clearly
he
explained
it
to
Levin.
If,
as
at
previous
elections,
all
the
districts
asked
the
marshal
of
the
province
to
stand,
then
he
would
be
elected
without
a
ballot.
That
must
not
be.
Now
eight
districts
had
agreed
to
call
upon
him:
if
two
refused
to
do
so,
Snetkov
might
decline
to
stand
at
all;
and
then
the
old
party
might
choose
another
of
their
party,
which
would
throw
them
completely
out
in
their
reckoning.
But
if
only
one
district,

did
not
call
upon
him
to
stand,
Snetkov
would
let
himself
be
balloted
for.
They
were
even,
some
of
them,
going
to
vote
for
him,
and
purposely
to
let
him
get
a
good
many
votes,
so
that
the
enemy
might
be
thrown
off
the
scent,
and
when
a
candidate
of
the
other
side
was
put
up,
they
too
might
give
him
some
votes.
Levin
understood
to
some
extent,
but
not
fully,
and
would
have
put
a
few
more
questions,
when
suddenly
everyone
began
talking
and
making
a
noise
and
they
moved
towards
the
big
room.
"What

"Why,

"The

Levin
heard
exclamations
on
all
sides,
and
he
moved
into
the
big
room
together
with
the
others,
all
hurrying
somewhere
and
afraid
of
missing
something.
Squeezed
by
the
crowding
nobler
he
drew
near
the
high
table
where
the
marshal

and
the
other
leaders
were
hotly
disputing
about
something.

Levin
was
standing
rather
far
off.
A
nobleman
breathing
heavily
and
hoarsely
at
his
side,
and
another
whose
thick
boots
were
creaking,
prevented
him
from
hearing

He
could
only
hear

that

the

the

and
began
to
explain
its

at
that
point
a

in
a
tight

that

the
back

him.

went
up
to

he

loudly:

course

had
proposed;
but
it
was
evident
that
he
hated
him
and
all
his
party,
and
this
feeling
of
hatred
spread
through
the
whole
party
and
roused
in
opposition

on
the
other
side.
Shouts
were
raised,
and
for
a
moment
all
was
confusion,
so
that
the
marshal
of
the
province
had
to
call
for
order.
"A

and

were
even
more
violent
and
furious
than
their

They
expressed
the
most
implacable

Levin
did
not
in
the
least
understand
what
was
the
matter,
and
he
marveled
at
the
passion
with
which
it
was
disputed

it
was

concluded
Sergey
Ivanovo.
But
Levin
forgot
all
that,
and
it
was
painful
to
him
to
see
all
these
excellent
persons,
for
whom
he
had
a
respect,
in
such
an
unpleasant
and
vicious
state
of
excitement.
To
escape
from
this
painful
feeling
he
went
away
into
the
other
room
where
there
was
nobody
except
the
waiters
at
the
refreshment
bar.
Seeing
the
waiters
busy
over
washing
up
the
crockery
and
setting
in
order
their
plates
and
wine
glasses,
seeing
their
calm
and
cheerful
faces,
Levin
felt
an
unexpected
sense
of
relief
as
though
he
had
come
out
of
a
stuffy
room
into
the
fresh
air.
He
began
walking
up
and
down,
looking
with
pleasure
at
the
waiters.
He
particularly
liked
the
way
one
gray-white
waiter,
who
showed
his
scorn
for
the
other
younger
ones
and
was
jeered
at
by
them,
was
teaching
them
how
to
fold
up
napkins
properly.
Levin
was
just
about
to
enter
into
conversation
with
the
old
waiter,
when
the
secretary

the
court

little
old
man

was
to

him
away.
"Please

said,
"your

Levin

into

ball,

followed

and
much
embarrassed,
he
turned
to

with
the
question,
"Where

He
asked
this
softly,
at
a
moment
when
there
was

on

so
that
he
had
hoped
his
question

not

and
two
nuts
were
found
in
the
box.
The
nobleman
was
allowed
the
right
to
vote,
and
the
new
party
had
conquered.
But
the
old
party
did
not
consider
themselves
conquered.
Levin
heard
that
they
were
asking
Snetkov
to
stand,
and
he
saw
that
a
crowd
of
noblemen
was
surrounding
the
marshal,
who
was
saying
something.
Levin
went
nearer.
In
reply
Snetkov
spoke
of
the
trust
the
noblemen
of
the
province
had
placed
in
him,
the
affection
they
had
shown
him,
which
he
did
not
deserve,
as
his
only
merit
had
been
his
attachment
to
the
nobility,
to
whom
he
had
devoted
twelve
years
of
service.
Several
times
he
repeated
the
words:
"I
have
served
to
the
best
of
my
powers
with
truth
and
good
faith,
I
value
your
goodness
and
thank
you,"
and
suddenly
he
stopped
short
from
the
tears
that
choked
him,
and
went
out
of
the
room.
Whether
these
tears
came
from
a
sense
of
the
injustice
being
done
him,
from
his
love
for
the
nobility,
or
from
the
strain
of
the
position
he
was
placed
in,
feeling
himself
surrounded
by
enemies,
his
emotion
infected
the
assembly,
the
majority
were
touched,
and
Levin
felt
a
tenderness
for
Snetzer
In
the
doorway
the
marshal
of
the
province
jostled
against
Levin.
"Beggars
pardon,
excuse
me,
please,"
he
said
as
to
a
stranger,
but
recognizing
Levin,
he
smiled
timidly.
It
seemed
to
Levin
that
he
would
have
liked
to
say
something,
but
could
not
speak
for
emotion.
His
face
and
his
whole
figure
in
his
uniform
with
the
crosses,
and
white
trousers

braid,"
as
he
moved
hurriedly
along,
reminded
Levin
of
some
hunted
beast
who
sees
that
he
is
in
evil
case.
This
expression
in
the
marshal's
face
was
particularly
touching
to
Levin,
because,
only
the
day
before,
he
had
been
at
his
house
about
his
trustee
business
and
had
seen
him
in
all
his
grandeur,
a
kind-spirited
fatherly
man.

the

boy,
coming
home
from

and
greeting
his

kissing
his

hand;
the
genuine,
cordial
words
and
gestures
of
the
old
man-about-the-house
this
had
the
day
before
roused
an
instinctive
feeling
of
respect
and
sympathy
in
Levin.
This
old
man
was
a
touching
and
pathetic
figure
to
Levin
now,
and
he
longed
to
say
something
pleasant
to
him.
"So
you're
sure
to
be
our
marshal
again,"
he
said.
"It's
not
likely,"
said
the
marshal,
looking
round
with
a
scared
expression.
"I'm
worn
out,
I'm
old.
If
there
are
men
younger
and
more
deserving
than
I,
let
them
serve."
And
the
marshal
disappeared
through
a
side
door.
The
most
solemn
moment
was
at
hand.
They
were
to
proceed
immediately
to
the
election.
The
leaders
of
both
parties

that

third

up

before

engagement,
though
they
were
getting
ready
for
the
fight,
sought
for
other
distractions
in
the
interval.
Some
were
lunching,
standing
at
the
bar,

sitting
at
the
table;
others
were
walking
up

down

smoking

talking
with

had
seen
him
already
at

previous
day,

he
had
studiously
avoided
him,
not
caring
to

him.
He
went
to
the
window
and
sat
down,
scanning
the
groups,
and
listening
to
what
was
being
said
around
him.
He
felt
depressed,

because
everyone

was,
as

eager,
anxious,
and
interested,

had
met
at

knew
him
at

stared
at

and
they
exchanged
greetings.

"Well,

asked
Levin.
"Oh,
still
just
the
same,
always
at
a
loss,"
the
landowner
answered
with
a
resigned
smile,
but
with
an
expression
of
serenity
and
conviction
that
so
it
must
be.
"And
how
do
you
come
to
be

asked.

pointed
to
the
imposing
figure
of
Stepan

in
white
trousers
and
his
court
uniform,
walking
by
with
a
general.
"I
ought
to
own
that
I
don't
very
well
understand
the
drift
of
the
provincial
elections,"
said
Levin.
The
landowner
looked
at
him.
"Why,
what
is
there
to
understand?
There's
no
meaning
in
it
at
all.
It's
a
decaying
institution
that
goes
on
running
only
by
the
force
of
inertia.
Just
look,
the
very
uniforms
tell
you
that
it's
an
assembly
of
justices

members

court,
and
so
on,
but
not
of

"Then
why
do
you
come?"
asked
Levin.
"From
habit,
nothing
else.
Then,
too,
one
must
keep
up
connections.
It's
a
moral
obligation
of
a
sort.
And
then,
to
tell
the
truth,
there's
one's
own
interests.
My
son-in-law
wants
to
stand
as
a
permanent
member;
they're
not
rich
people,
and
he
must
be
brought
forward.
These
gentlemen,
now,
what
do
they
come
for?"

said,
pointing
to
the
malignant
gentleman,
who
was
talking
at
the
high
table.
"That's

how

"Oh,

"Yes,

and
thank
God
for

But

is
thrown
in
for
nothing."
"Then
why
do
you
do
it,
if
it's
a
clear
loss?"
"Oh,
well,
one
does
it!
What
would
you
have?
It's
habit,
and
one
knows
it's
how
it
should
be.
And
what's
more,"
the
landowner
went
on,
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
window
and
chatting
on,
"my
son,
I
must
tell
you,

There's
no

the

went
up,
he
held
the
ball
in
his
right
hand,
but
thinking
he
was
wrong,
just
at
the
box
he
changed
to
the
left
hand,
and
undoubtedly
put
the
ball
to
the
left.

with
annoyance.
It
was
no
good
for
him
to
use
his
insight.
Everything
was
still,
and
the
counting
of
the
balls
was
heard.
Then
a
single
voice
rose
and
proclaimed
the
numbers
for
and
against.
The
marshal
had
been
voted
for
by
a
considerable
majority.
All
was
noise
and
eager
movement
towards
the
doors.
Snetkov
came
in,
and
the
nobles
thronged
round
him,
congratulating
him.
"Well,
now
is
it
over?"
Levin
asked
Sergey
Ivanovo.
"It's
only
just
beginning,"
Svider.

replying
for
Sergey

with
a
smile.
"Some

marshaled
Levin
had
quite
forgotten
about
that.
Now
he
could
only
remember
that
there
was
some
sort
of
trickery
in
it,
but
he
was
too
bored
to
think
what
it
was
exactly.
He
felt
depressed,
and
longed
to
get
out
of
the
crowd.
As
no
one
was
paying
any
attention
to
him,
and
no
one
apparently
needed
him,
he
quietly
slipped
away
into
the
little
room
where
the
refreshments
were,
and
again
had
a
great
sense
of
comfort
when
he
saw
the
waiters.
The
little
old
waiter
pressed
him
to
have
something,
and
Levin
agreed.
After
eating
a
cutlet
with
beans
and
talking
to
the
waiters
of
their
former
masters,
Levin,
not
wishing
to
go
back
to
the
hall,
where
it
was
all
so
distasteful
to
him,
proceeded
to
walk
through
the
galleries.
The
galleries
were
full
of
fashionably
dressed
ladies,
leaning
over
the
balustrade,
and
trying
not
to
lose
a
single
word
of
what
was
being
said
below.
With
the
ladies
were
sitting
and
standing
smart
lawyers,
high
school
teachers
in
spectacles,
and
officers.
Everywhere
they
were
talking
of
the
election,
and
of
how
worried
the
marshal
was,
and
how
splendid
the
discussions
had
been.
In
one
group
Levin
heard
his
brother's
praises.
One
lady
was
telling
a
lawyer:
"How
glad
I
am
I
heard
Kozo
It's
worth
losing
one's
dinner.
He's
exquisite.
So
clear
and
distinct
all
of
it!
There's
not
one
of
you
in
the
law
courts
that
speaks
like
that.
The
only
one
is
Meidel,
and
he's
not
so
eloquent
by
a
long
way."
Finding
a
free
place,
Levin
leaned
over
the
balustrade,
and
began
looking
and
listening.
All
the
noblemen
were
sitting
railed
off
behind
barriers
according
to
their
districts.
In
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
a
man
in
a
uniform,
who
shouted
in
a
loud,
high
voice:
"As
a
candidate
for
the
marshes
of
the
nobility
of
the
province

call

Yevgeni

A
dead
silence
followed,
and
then
a
weak
old
voice
was
heard:
"Declining
"We
call

the
privy
councilor
Pyotr

the
voice
began
again.
"Declining
a
high
boyish
voice
replied.
Again
it
began,
and
again
"Declining
And
so
it
went
on
for
about
an
hour.
Levin,
with
his
elbows
on
the
balustrade,
looked
and
listened.
At
first
he
wondered
and
wanted
to
know
what
it
meant?
then
feeling
sure
that
he
could
not
make
it
out
he
began
to
be
bored.
Then
recalling
all
the
excitement
and
vindictiveness
he
had
seen
on
all
the
faces,
he
felt
null
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go,
and
went
downstairs.
As
he
passed
through
the
entry
to
the
galleries
he
met
a
dejected
high
school
boy
walking
up
and
down
with
tired-looking
eyes.
On
the
stairs
he
met
a
couple.
lady
running
quickly
on
her
high
heels
and
the
jaunty
deputy
prosecutor.
"I
told
you
you
weren't
late,"
the
deputy
prosecutor
was
saying
at
the
moment
when
Levin
moved
aside
to
let
the
lady
pass.
Levin
was
on
the
stairs
to
the
way
out,
and
was
just
feeling
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
for
the
number
of
his
overcoat,
when
the
secretary
overtook
him.
"This
way,
please,
Konstantin
Dmitrin
they
are
voting."
The
candidate
who
was
being
voted
on
was
Nevzat
who
had
so
stoutly
denied
all
idea
of
standing.
Levin
went
up
to
the
door
of
the
room;
it
was
locked.
The
secretary
knocked-down
the
door
opened,
and
Levin
was
met
by
two
red-faced
gentlemen,
who
darted
out.
"I
can't
stand
any
more
of
it,"
said
one
red-faced
gentleman.
After
them
the
face
of
the
marshal
of
the
province
was
poked
out.
His
face
was
dreadful.
from
exhaustion
and
dismay.
"I
told
you
not
to
let
any
one
out!"
he
cried
to
the
doorkeepers
"I
let
someone
in,
your
excellent
"Merger
on
us!"
and
with
a
heavy
sigh
the
marshal
of
the
province
walked
with
downcast
head
to
the
high
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room,
his
legs
staggering
in
his
white
trousers.
Nevzat
had
scored
a
higher
majority,
as
they
had
planned,
and
he
was
the
new
marshal
of
the
province.
Many
people
were
amused,
many
were
pleased
and
happy,
many
were
in
ecstasy
many
were
disgusted
and
unhappy.
The
former
marshal
of
the
province
was
in
a
state
of
despair,
which
he
could
not
conceal.
When
Nevzat
went
out
of
the
room,
the
crowd
thronged
round
him
and
followed
him
enthusiastically,
just
as
they
had
followed
the
governor
who
had
opened
the
meetings,
and
just
as
they
had
followed
Snetkov
when
he
was
elected.

The
newly
elected
marshal
and
many
of
the
successful
party
dined
that
day
with
Vrye
Vrye
had
come
to
the
elections
partly
because
he
was
bored
in
the
country
and
wanted
to
show
Anna
his
right
to
independence,
and
also
to
repay
Svider.
by
his
support
at
the
election
for
all
the
trouble
he
had
taken
for
Vrye
at
the
district
council
election,
but
chiefly
in
order
strictly
to
perform
all
those
duties
of
a
nobleman
and
landowner
which
he
had
taken
upon
himself.
But
he
had
not
in
the
least
expected
that
the
election
would
so
interest
him,
so
keenly
excite
him,
and
that
he
would
be
so
good
at
this
kind
of
thing.
He
was
quite
a
new
man
in
the
circle
of
the
nobility
of
the
province,
but
his
success
was
unmistakable.
and
he
was
not
wrong
in
supposing
that
he
had
already
obtained
a
certain
influence.
This
influence
was
due
to
his
wealth
and
reputation,
the
capital
house
in
the
town
lent
him
by
his
old
friend
Shirks
who
had
a
post
in
the
department
of
finances
and
was
director
of
a
flourishing
bank

excellent
cook

brought
from
the
country,
and
his
friendship
with
the
governor,
who
was
a
schoolfriend
of
Vrye
schoolfriend
he
had
patronized
and
protected
indeed.
But
what
contributed
more
than
all
to
his
success
was
his
direct,
equable
manner
with
everyone,
which
very
quickly
made
the
majority
of
the
noblemen

opinion

He
saw
clearly,
and
other
people
recognized
it,
too,
that
he
had
done
a
great
deal
to
secure
the
success
of
Nevzat
And
now
at
his
own
table,
celebrating
Nevzat
election,
he
was
experiencing
an
agreeable
sense
of
triumph
over
the
success
of
his
candidate.
The
election
itself
had
so
fascinated
him
that,
if
he
could
succeed
in
getting
married
during
the
next
three
years,
he
began
to
think
of
standing
himself.

after
winning
a
race
ridden
by
a
jockey,
he
had
longed
to
ride

Today
he

success
of

at

on

the
young
governor,
a
general

To
all
the
rest
he
was
the
chief
man
in
the
province,
who
had
solemnly
opened
the
elections
with

speech,

aroused

feeling

And
so
every

as
he
said,
was
on

was

over

Stepan

glad,

that

was

affected
to
be
not

scornful

it

that

Vrye
was
satisfied.
He
had
never
expected
to
find
so
pleasant
a
tone
in
the
provinces.
Towards
the
end
of
dinner
it
was
still
more
lively.
The
governor
asked
Vrye
to
come
to
a
concert
for
the
benefit
of
the
Service
which
his
wife,
who
was
anxious
to
make
his
acquaintance,
had
been
getting
up.
"There'll

"Not

answered.

liked

But
he
smiled,

promised
to
come.
Before
they
rose
from

table,
when
all
of

were
smoking,

up
to

one
of
the
guests
in

of
the
valet,
while
Vrye
frowns
read
the
letter.
The
letter
was
from
Anna.
Before
he
read
the
letter,
he
knew
its
contents.
Expecting
the
elections
to
be
over
in
five
days,
he
had
promised
to
be
back
on
Friday.
Today
was
Saturday,
and
he
knew
that
the
letter
contained
reproaches
for
not
being
back
at
the
time
fixed.
The
letter
he
had
sent
the
previous
evening
had
probably
not
reached
her
yet.
The
letter
was
what
he
had
expected,
but
the
form
of
it
was
unexpected,
and
particularly
disagreeable
to
him.
"Annie
is
very
ill,
the
doctor
says
it
may
be

I
am
losing
my
head

alone.

hindrance.

now
I
am

out
where
you
are

what
you
are
doing.
I
wanted
to
come
myself,
but

better
of
it,
knowing
you
would
dislike
it.

I

The
child
ill,
yet
she
had
thought
of
coming
herself.

ill,
and
this
hostile
tone.
The
innocent
festivities
over
the
election,
and
this
gloomy,
burdensome
love
to
which
he
had
to
return
struck
Vrye
by
their
contrast.
But
he
had
to
go,
and
by
the
first
train
that
night
he
set
off
home.
Chapter
32
Before
Vrye
departure
for
the
elections,
Anna
had
reflected
that
the
scenes
constantly
repeated
between
them
each
time
he
left
home,
might
only
make
him
cold
to
her
instead
of
attaching
him
to
her,
and
resolved
to
do
all
she
could
to
control
herself
so
as
to
bear
the
parting
with
composure.
But
the
cold,
severe
glance
with
which
he
had
looked
at
her
when
he
came
to
tell
her
he
was
going
had
wounded
her,
and
before
he
had
started
her
peace
of
mind
was
destroyed.
In
solitude
afterwards,
thinking
over
that
glance
which
had
expressed
his
right
to
freedom,
she
came,
as
she
always
did,
to
the
same
point-and-shoot
sense
of
her
own
humiliation.
"He
has
the
right
to
go
away
when
and
where
he
chooses.
Not
simply
to
go
away,
but
to
leave
me.
He
has
every
right,
and
I
have
none.
But
knowing
that,
he
ought
not
to
do
it.
What
has
he
done,
thoughout
He
looked
at
me
with
a
cold,
severe
expression.
Of
course
that
is
something
indefinite
impanel
but
it
has
never
been
so
before,
and
that
glance
means
a
great
deal,"
she
thought.
"That
glance
shows
the
beginning
of
indifference."
And
though
she
felt
sure
that
a
coldness
was
beginning,
there
was
nothing
she
could
do,
she
could
not
in
any
way
alter
her
relations
to
him.
Just
as
before,
only
by
love
and
by
charm
could
she
keep
him.
And
so,
just
as
before,
only
by
occupation
in
the
day,
by
morphine
at
night,
could
she
stifle
the
fearful
thought
of
what
would
be
if
he
ceased
to
love
her.
It
is
true
there
was
still
one
means?
not
to
keep
him-her
that
she
wanted
nothing
more
than
his
love-affair
to
be
nearer
to
him,
to
be
in
such
a
position
that
he
would
not
leave
her.
That
means
was
divorce
and
marriage.
And
she
began
to
long
for
that,
and
made
up
her
mind
to
agree
to
it
the
first
time
he
or
Stivaletti
approached
her
on
the
subject.
Absorbed
in
such
thoughts,
she
passed
five
days
without
him,
the
five
days
that
he
was
to
be
at
the
elections.

of
all,
reading.
of
one
book
after
another.
up
her
time.
But
on
the
sixth
day,
when
the
coachman,
came
back
without
him,
she
felt
that
now
she
was
utterly
incapable
of
stifling
the
thought
of
him
and
of
what
he
was
doing
there,
just
at
that
time
her
little
girl
was
taken
ill.
Anna
began
to
look
after
her,
but
even
that
did
not
distract
her
mind,
especially
as
the
illness
was
not
serious.
However
hard
she
tried,
she
could
not
love
this
little
child,
and
to
feign
love
was
beyond
her
powers.
Towards
the
evening
of
that
day,
still
alone,
Anna
was
in
such
a
panic
about
him
that
she
decided
to
start
for
the
town,
but
on
second
thoughts
wrote
him
the
contradictory
letter
that
Vrye
received,
and
without
reading
it
through,
sent
it
off
by
a
special
messenger.
The
next
morning
she
received
his
letter
and
regretted
her
own.
She
dreaded
a
repetition
of
the
severe
look
he
had
flung
at
her
at
parting,
especially
when
he
knew
that
the
baby
was
not
dangerously
ill.
But
still
she
was
glad
she
had
written
to
him.
At
this
moment
Anna
was
positively
admitting
to
herself
that
she
was
a
burden
to
him,
that
he
would
relinquish
his
freedom
regretfully
to
return
to
her,
and
in
spite
of
that
she
was
glad
he
was
coming.
Let
him
weary
of
her,
but
he
would
be
here
with
her,
so
that
she
would
see
him,
would
know
of
every
action
he
took.
She
was
sitting
in
the
drawing
room
near
a
lamp,
with
a
new
volume
of
Tainer,
and
as
she
read,
listening
to
the
sound
of
the
wind
outside,
and
every
minute
expecting
the
carriage
to
arrive.
Several
times
she
had
fancied
she
heard
the
sound
of
wheels,
but
she
had
been
mistaken.
At
last
she
heard
not
the
sound
of
wheels,
but
the
coachman,
shout
and
the
dull
rumble
in
the
covered
entry.
Even
Princess
Varvares
playing
patience,
confirmed
this,
and
Anna,
flushing
hotly-contested
got
up;
but
instead
of
going
down,
as
she
had
done
twice
before,
she
stood
still.
She
suddenly
felt
ashamed
of
her
duplicity,
but
even
more
she
dreaded
how
he
might
meet
her.
All
feeling
of
wounded
pride
had
passed
now;
she
was
only
afraid
of
the
expression
of
his
displeasure.
She
remembered
that
her
child
had
been
perfectly
well
again
for
the
last
two
days.
She
felt
positively
vexed
with
her
for
getting
better
from
the
very
moment
her
letter
was
sent
off.
Then
she
thought
of
him,
that
he
was
here,
all
of
him,
with
his
hands,
his
eyes.
She
heard
his
voice.
And
forgetting
everything,
she
ran
joyfully
to
meet
him.
"Well,
how
is
Anniesland.
he
said
timidly
from
below,
looking
up
to
Anna
as
she
ran
down
to
him.
He
was
sitting
on
a
chair,
and
a
footmen,
was
pulling
off
his
warm
over-borrowed
"Oh,
she
is
better."
"And
you?"
he
said,
shaking
himself.
She
took
his
hand
in
both
of
hers,
and
drew
it
to
her
waist,
never
taking
her
eyes
off
him.
"Well,
I'm
glad,"
he
said,
coldly
scanning
her,
her
hair,
her
dress,
which
he
knew
she
had
put
on
for
him.
All
was
charming,
but
how
many
times
it
had
charmed
him!
And
the
stern,
stony
expression
that
she
so
dreaded
settled
upon
his
face.
"Well,
I'm
glade
And
are
you
well?'
he
said,
wiping
his
damp
beard
with
his
handkerchief
and
kissing
her
hand.
"Never
mind,"
she
thought,
"only
let
him
be
here,
and
so
long
as
he's
here
he
cannot,
he
dare
not,
cease
to
love
me."
The
evening
was
spent
happily
and
gaily
in
the
presence
of
Princess
Varvares
who
complained
to
him
that
Anna
had
been
taking
morphine
in
his
absence.
"What
am
I
to
do?
I
couldn't
sleep/dream
My
thoughts
prevented
me.
When
he's
here
I
never
take
it-can't-happen-to-me
ever."
He
told
her
about
the
election,
and
Anna
knew
how
by
adroit
questions
to
bring
him
to
what
gave
him
most
pleasure-seekers."
own
success.
She
told
him
of
everything
that
interested
him
at
home;
and
all
that
she
told
him
was
of
the
most
cheerful
description.
But
late
in
the
evening,
when
they
were
alone,
Anna,
seeing
that
she
had
regained
complete
possession
of
him,
wanted
to
erase
the
painful
impression
of
the
glance
he
had
given
her
for
her
letter.
She
said:
"Tell
me
frankly,
you
were
vexed
at
getting
my
letter,
and
you
didn't
believe
me?"
As
soon
as
she
had
said
it,
she
felt
that
however
warm
his
feelings
were
to
her,
he
had
not
forgiven
her
for
that.
"Yes,"
he
said,
"the
letter
was
so
strange.
First,
Annie
ill,
and
then
you
thought
of
coming
yourself."
"It
was
all
the
truth."
"Oh,
I
don't
doubt
it."
"Yes,
you
do
doubt
it.
You
are
vexes
I
see."
"Not
for
one
moment.
I'm
only
vexes
that's
true,
that
you
seem
somehow
unwilling
to
admit
that
there
are
duties:
"The
duty
of
going
to
a
concert:
"But
we
won't
talk
about
it,"
he
said.
"Why
not
talk
about
it?"
she
said.
"I
only
meant
to
say
that
matters
of
real
importance
may
turn
up.
Now,
for
instance,
I
shall
have
to
go
to
Moscow
to
arrange
about
the
house/guest
Oh,
Anna,
why
are
you
so
irritancy
Don't
you
know
that
I
can't
live
without
you?"
"If
so,"
said
Anna,
her
voice
suddenly
changing,
"it
means
that
you
are
sick
of
this
life:
Yes,
you
will
come
for
a
day
and
go
away,
as
men
do:
"Anne
that's
cruel.
I
am
ready
to
give
up
my
whole
life."
But
she
did
not
hear
him.
"If
you
go
to
Moscow,
I
will
go
too.
I
will
not
stay
here.
Either
we
must
separate
or
else
live
together."
"Why,
you
know,
that's
my
one
desire.
But
for
that:
"We
must
get
a
divorce.
I
will
write
to
him.
I
see
I
cannot
go
on
like
this:
But
I
will
come
with
you
to
Moscow."
"You
talk
as
if
you
were
threatening
me.
But
I
desire
nothing
so
much
as
never
to
be
parted
from
you,"
said
Vrye
smiling.
But
as
he
said
these
words
there
gleamed
in
his
eyes
not
merely
a
cold
look,
but
the
vindictive
look
of
a
man
persecuted
and
made
cruel.
She
saw
the
look
and
correctly
divinely
its
meaning.
"If
so,
it's
a
calamity,"
that
glance
told
her.
It
was
a
moment's
impression,
but
she
never
forgot
it.
Anna
wrote
to
her
husband
asking
him
about
a
divorce,
and
towards
the
end
of
November,
taking
leave
of
Princess
Varvares
who
wanted
to
go
to
Petersburg,
she
went
with
Vrye
to
Moscow.
Expecting
every
day
an
answer
from
Alexey

and
after
that

now
established
themselves
together
like

people.
PART
SEVENTY-year-old
Chapter
1
The
Levins
had
been
three
months
in
Moscow.
The
date
had
long
passed
on
which,
according
to
the
most
trustworthy
calculations
of
people
learned
in
such
matters,
Kitty
should
have
been
confined.
But
she
was
still
about,
and
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
her
time
was
any
nearer
than
two
months
ago.
The
doctor,
the
monthly
nurse,
and
Dolly
and
her
mother,
and
most
of
all
Levin,
who
could
not
think
of
the
approaching
event
without
terror,
began
to
be
impatient
and
uneasy.
Kitty
was
the
only
person
who
felt
perfectly
calm
and
happy.
She
was
distinctly
conscious
now
of
the
birth
of
a
new
feeling
of
love
for
the
future
child,
for
her
to
some
extent
actually
existing
already,
and
she
brooded
blissfully
over
this
feeling.
He
was
not
by
now
altogether
a
part
of
herself,
but
sometimes
lived
his
own
life
independently
of
her.
Often
this
separate
being
gave
her
pain,
but
at
the
same
time
she
wanted
to
laugh
with
a
strange
new
joy.
All
the
people
she
loved
were
with
her,
and
all
were
so
good
to
her,
so
attentively
caring
for
her,
so
entirely
pleasant
was
everything
presented
to
her,
that
if
she
had
not
known
and
felt
that
it
must
all
soon
be
over,
she
could
not
have
wished
for
a
better
and
pleasanter
life.
The
only
thing
that
spoiled
the
charm
of
this
manner
of
life
was
that
her
husband
was
not
here
as
she
loved
him
to
be,
and
as
he
was
in
the
country.
She
liked
his
serene,
friendly,
and
hospitable
manner
in
the
country.
In
the
town
he
seemed
continually
uneasy
and
on
his
guard,
as
though
he
were
afraid
someone
would
be
rude
to
him,
and
still
more
to
her.
At
home
in
the
country,
knowing
himself
distinctly
to
be
in
his
right
place,
he
was
never
in
haste
to
be
off
elsewhere.
He
was
never
unoccupied.
Here
in
town
he
was
in
a
continual
hurry,
as
though
afraid
of
missing
something,
and
yet
he
had
nothing
to
do.
And
she
felt
sorry
for
him.
To
others,
she
knew,
he
did
not
appear
an
object
of
pity.
On
the
contrary,
when
Kitty
looked
at
him
in
society,
as
one
sometimes
looks
at
those
one
loves,
trying
to
see
him
as
if
he
were
a
stranger,
so
as
to
catch
the
impression
he
must
make
on
others,
she
saw
with
a
panic
even
of
jealous
fear
that
he
was
far
indeed
from
being
a
pitiable
figure,
that
he
was
very
attractive
with
his
fine
breeding,
his
rather
old-fashioned,
reserved
courtesy
with
women,
his
powerful
figure,
and
striking,
as
she
thought,
and
expressive
face.
But
she
saw
him
not
from
without,
but
from
within;
she
saw
that
here
he
was
not
himself;
that
was
the
only
way
she
could
define
his
condition
to
herself.
Sometimes
she
inwardly
reproached
him
for
his
inability
to
live
in
the
town;
sometimes
she
recognized
that
it
was
really
hard
for
him
to
order
his
life
here
so
that
he
could
be
satisfied
with
it.
What
had
he
to
do,
indeed?
He
did
not
care
for
cards;
he
did
not
go
to
a
club.
Spending
the
time
with
jovial
gentlemen
of
Obninsk's
type-O
knew
now
what
that
meant
...
it
meant
drinking
and
going
somewhere
after
drinking.
She
could
not
think
without
horror
of
where
men
went
on
such
occasions.
Was
he
to
go
into
society?
But
she
knew
he
could
only
find
satisfaction
in
that
if
he
took
pleasure
in
the
society
of
young
women,
and
that
she
could
not
wish
for.
Should
he
stay
at
home
with
her,
her
mother
and
her
sisters?
But
much
as
she
liked
and
enjoyed
their
conversations
forever
on
the
same
subjects.
as
the
old
prince
called
the
sisters'
talks.
knew
it
must
bore
him.
What
was
there
left
for
him
to
do?
To
go
on
writing
at
his
book
he
had
indeed
attempted,
and
at
first
he
used
to
go
to
the
library
and
make
extracts
and
look
up
references
for
his
book.
But,
as
he
told
her,
the
more
he
did
nothing,
the
less
time
he
had
to
do
anything.
And
besides,
he
complained
that
he
had
talked
too
much
about
his
book
here,
and
that
consequently
all
his
ideas
about
it
were
muddled
and
had
lost
their
interest
for
him.
One
advantage
in
this
town
life
was
that
quarrels
hardly
ever
happened
between
them
here
in
town.
Whether
it
was
that
their
conditions
were
different,
or
that
they
had
both
become
more
careful
and
sensible
in
that
respect,
they
had
no
quarrels
in
Moscow
from
jealousy,
which
they
had
so
dreaded
when
they
moved
from
the
country.
One
event,
an
event
of
great
importance
to
both
from
that
point
of
view,
did
indeed
happen.
was
Kitty,
meeting
with
Vrye
The
old
Princess
Maryam
Borja
Kitty,
godmother,
who
had
always
been
very
fond
of
her,
had
insisted
on
seeing
her.
Kitty,
though
she
did
not
go
into
society
at
all
on
account
of
her
condition,
went
with
her
father
to
see
the
venerable
old
lady,
and
there
met
Vrye
The
only
thing
Kitty
could
reproach
herself
for
at
this
meeting
was
that
at
the
instant
when
she
recognized
in
his
civilian
dress
the
features
once
so
familiar
to
her,
her
breath
failed
her,
the
blood
rushed
to
her
heart,
and
a
vivid
blush-inducing
felt
it-can't-happen-to-me
her
face.
But
this
lasted
only
a
few
seconds.
Before
her
father,
who
purposely
began
talking
in
a
loud
voice
to
Vrye
had
finished,
she
was
perfectly
ready
to
look
at
Vrye
to
speak
to
him,
if
necessary,
exactly
as
she
spoke
to
Princess
Maryam
Borja
and
more
than
that,
to
do
so
in
such
a
way
that
everything
to
the
faintest
intonation
and
smile
would
have
been
approved
by
her
husband,
whose
unseen
presence
she
seemed
to
feel
about
her
at
that
instant.
She
said
a
few
words
to
him,
even
smiled
serenely
at
his
joke
about
the
elections,
which
he
called
"our
parliament."
(She
had
to
smile
to
show
she
saw
the
joke:
But
she
turned
away
immediately
to
Princess
Maryam
Borja
and
did
not
once
glance
at
him
till
he
got
up
to
go;
then
she
looked
at
him,
but
evidently
only
because
it
would
be
uncivil
not
to
look
at
a
man
when
he
is
saying
good-bye.
She
was
grateful
to
her
father
for
saying
nothing
to
her
about
their
meeting
Vrye
but
she
saw
by
his
special
warmth
to
her
after
the
visit
during
their
usual
walk
that
he
was
pleased
with
her.
She
was
pleased
with
herself.
She
had
not
expected
she
would
have
had
the
power,
while
keeping
somewhere
in
the
bottom
of
her
heart
all
the
memories
of
her
old
feeling
for
Vrye
not
only
to
seem
but
to
be
perfectly
indifferent
and
composed
with
him.
Levin
flushed
a
great
deal
more
than
she
when
she
told
him
she
had
met
Vrye
at
Princess
Maryam
Borja
It
was
very
hard
for
her
to
tell
him
this,
but
still
harder
to
go
on
speaking
of
the
details
of
the
meeting,
as
he
did
not
question
her,
but
simply
gazed
at
her
with
a
frown.
"I
am
very
sorry
you
weren't
there,"
she
said.
"Not
that
you
weren't
in
the
room
...
I
couldn't
have
been
so
natural
in
your
presence
...
I
am
blushing
now
much
more,
much,
much
more,"
she
said,
blushing
till
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes.
"But
that
you
couldn't
see
through
a
crack."
The
truthful
eyes
told
Levin
that
she
was
satisfied
with
herself,
and
in
spite
of
her
blushing
he
was
quickly
reassured
and
began
questioning
her,
which
was
all
she
wanted.
When
he
had
heard
everything,
even
to
the
detail
that
for
the
first
second
she
could
not
help
flushing.
but
that
afterwards
she
was
just
as
direct
and
as
much
at
her
ease
as
with
any
chance
acquaintance,
Levin
was
quite
happy
again
and
said
he
was
glad
of
it,
and
would
not
now
behave
as
stupidly
as
he
had
done
at
the
election,
but
would
try
the
first
time
he
met
Vrye
to
be
as
friendly
as
possible.
"It's
so
wretched
to
feel
that
there's
a
man
almost
an
enemy
whom
it's
painful
to
meet,"
said
Levin.
"I'm
very,
very
glade

laughed.

"Yes,

"No,

said
Kitty,
looking
into
his
face
with
a
laugh.
She
took
his
hand.
"Well,

He
was
just
going
out
after
kissing
his

when
she
stopped
him.

"Oh,

he
said,
with
the
expression
of
dissatisfaction
she
knew
so
well.
"No,

a

She
held
his
hand.
"Let's
talk

"Oh,

he
said
with
a
little
cough,
looking
at

from
under
his

she
knew
well.
It
was
a
sign
of
intense
dissatisfaction,
not
with
her,
but
with
himself.
He
certainly
was
displeased
not
at
so
much

being
spent,

at
being
reminded
of
what
he,
knowing

was

to

"Yes,

repeated.

On
the
steps
Levin
was
stopped
by
his
old
servant
Kouzmine
who
had
been

him
before
his
marriage,
and
now
looked
after
their

he
said.
"What

During
the
first
part
of
their
stay
in
Moscow,
Levin
had
used
his
own
horses
brought
up
from
the
country.
He
had
tried
to
arrange
this
part
of
their
expenses
in
the
best
and
cheapest
way
possible;
but
it
appeared
that
their
own
horses
came
dearer
than
hired
horses,
and
they
still
hired
too.

Kouzmine
Levin
was
not

now
struck
as
he
had
been
at
first
by
the
fact
that
to
get
from
one
end
of
Moscow
to
the
other
he
had
to
have
two
powerful
horses
put
into
a
heavy
carriage,
to
take
the
carriage
three
miles
through
the
snowy
slush
and
to
keep
it
standing
there
four
hours,
paying
five
roubles
every
time.
Now
it
seemed
quite
natural.
"Hiring
a
pair
for
our
carriage
from
the
jobs
said
he.
"Yes,
sir."
And
so,
simply
and
easily,
thanks
to
the
facilities
of
town
life,
Levin
settled
a
question
which,
in
the
country,
would
have
called
for
so
much
personal
trouble
and
exertion,
and
going
out
onto
the
steps,
he
called
a
sledgehammer
sat
down,
and
drove
to
Nikiya
On
the
way
he
thought
no
more
of
money,
but
mused
on
the
introduction
that
awaited
him
to
the
Petersburg
savant,"
a
writer
on
sociology,
and
what
he
would
say
to
him
about
his
book.
Only
during
the
first
days
of
his
stay
in
Moscow
Levin
had
been
struck
by
the
expenditure,
strange
to
one
living
in
the
country,
unproductive
but
inevitable,
that
was
expected
of
him
on
every
side.
But
by
now
he
had
grown
used
to
it.
That
had
happened
to
him
in
this
matter
which
is
said
to
happen
to
drunken
first

sticks
in
the
throat,
the
second
flies
down
like
a
hawk,"
but
after
the
third
they're
like
tiny
little
birds.
When
Levin
had
changed
his
first
hundred-year
note
to
pay
for
liverlike
for
his
footmen,
and
hall.
he
could
not
help
reflecting
that
these
liverlike
were
of
no
use
to
anyone.
they
were
induce
necessary,
to
judge
by
the
amazement
of
the
princess
and
Kitty
when
he
suggested
that
they
might
do
without
liverlike
these
liverlike
would
cost
the
wages
of
two
laborers
for
the
summer,
that
is,
would
pay
for
about
three
hundred
working
days
from
Easter
to
Ash
Wednesday,
and
each
a
day
of
hard
work
from
early
morning
to
late
evening-dress
that
hundred-year
note
did
stick
in
his
throat.
But
the
next
note,
changed
to
pay
for
providing
a
dinner
for
their
relations,
that
cost
twenty-first
roubles,
though
it
did
excite
in
Levin
the
reflection
that
twenty-first
roubles
meant
nine
measures
of
oats,
which
men
would
with
groans
and
sweat
have
reaped
and
bound
and
thrashed
and
winnowed
and
sifted
and
sown.
next
one
he
parted
with
more
easily.
And
now
the
notes
he
changed
no
longer
aroused
such
reflections,
and
they
flew
off
like
little
birds.
Whether
the
labor
devoted
to
obtaining
the
money
corresponded
to
the
pleasure
given
by
what
was
bought
with
it,
was
a
consideration
he
had
long
ago
dismissed.
His
business
calculation
that
there
was
a
certain
price
below
which
he
could
not
sell
certain
grain
was
forgotten
too.
The
rye,
for
the
price
of
which
he
had
so
long
held
out,
had
been
sold
for
fifty
kopecks
a
measure
cheaper
than
it
had
been
fetching
a
month
ago.
Even
the
consideration
that
with
such
an
expenditure
he
could
not
go
on
living
for
a
year
without
debt,
that
even
had
no
force.
Only
one
thing
was
null
to
have
money
in
the
bank,
without
inquiring
where
it
came
from,
so
as
to
know
that
one
had
the
wherewithal
to
buy
meat
for
tomorrow.
And
this
condition
had
hitherto
been
fulfilled;
he
had
always
had
the
money
in
the
bank.
But
now
the
money
in
the
bank
had
gone,
and
he
could
not
quite
tell
where
to
get
the
next
installment.
And
this
it
was
which,
at
the
moment
when
Kitty
had
mentioned
money,
had
disturbed
him;
but
he
had
no
time
to
think
about
it.
He
drove
off,
thinking
of
Katawazi
and
the
meeting
with
Metrozoo
that
was
before
him.
Chapter
3
Levin
had
on
this
visit
to
town
seen
a
great
deal
of
his
old
friend
at
the
university,
Professor
Katawazi
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
his
marriage.
He
liked
in
Katawazi
the
clears
and
simplicity
of
his
conception
of
life.
Levin
thought
that
the
clears
of
Katawazi
conception
of
life
was
due
to
the
poverty
of
his
nature;
Katawazi
thought
that
the
disconnecting
of
Levin's
ideas
was
due
to
his
lack
of
intellectual
discipline;
but
Levin
enjoyed
Katawazi
clears
and
Katawazi
enjoyed
the
abundance
of
Levin's
untrained
ideas,
and
they
liked
to
meet
and
to
discuss.
Levin
had
read
Katawazi
some
parts
of
his
book,
and
he
had
liked
them.
On
the
previous
day
Katawazi
had
met
Levin
at
a
public
lecture
and
told
him
that
the
celebrated
Metrozoo
whose
article
Levin
had
so
much
liked,
was
in
Moscow,
that
he
had
been
much
interested
by
what
Katawazi
had
told
him
about
Levin's
work,
and
that
he
was
coming
to
see
him
tomorrow
at
eleven-day
and
would
be
very
glad
to
make
Levin's
acquaintance.
"You're
positively
a
reformed
character,
I'm
glad
to
see,"
said
Katawazi
meeting
Levin
in
the
little
drawing
room.
"I
heard
the
bell
and
thought:
Impossible
that
it
can
be
he
at
the
exact
time"
Well,
what
do
you
say
to
the
Montenegrins
now?
They're
a
race
of
warriors."
"Why,
what's
happened?"
asked
Levin.
Katawazi
in
a
few
words
told
him
the
last
piece
of
news
from
the
war,
and
going
into
his
study,
introduced
Levin
to
a
short,
thick-set
man
of
pleasant
appearance.
This
was
Metrozoo
The
conversation
touched
for
a
brief
space
on
politics
and
on
how
recent
events
were
looked
at
in
the
higher
spheres
in
Petersburg.
Metrozoo
repeated
a
saying
that
had
reached
him
through
a
most
trustworthy
source,
reported
as
having
been
uttered
on
this
subject
by
the
Tsar
and
one
of
the
ministers.
Katawazi
had
heard
also
on
excellent
authority
that
the
Tsar
had
said
something
quite
different.
Levin
tried
to
imagine
circumstances
in
which
both
sayings
might
have
been
uttered,
and
the
conversation
on
that
topic
dropped.
"Yes,
here
he's
written
almost
a
book
on
the
natural
conditions
of
the
laborer
in
relation
to
the
land,"
said
Katawazi
"I'm
not
a
specialist,
but
I,
as
a
natural
science
man,
was
pleased
at
his
not
taking
mankind
as
something
outside
biological
laws;
but,
on
the
contrary,
seeing
his
dependence
on
his
surroundings,
and
in
that
dependence
seeking
the
laws
of
his
development."
"That's
very
interesting,"
said
Metrozoo
"What
I
began
precisely
was
to
write
a
book
on
agriculture;
but
studying
the
chief
instrument
of
agriculture,
the
laborer.
said
Levin,
reddening,
"I
could
not
help
coming
to
quite
unexpected
results."
And
Levin
began
carefully,
as
it
were,
feeling
his
ground,
to
expound
his
views.
He
knew
Metrozoo
had
written
an
article
against
the
generally
accepted
theory
of
political
economy,
but
to
what
extent
he
could
reckon
on
his
sympathy
with
his
own
new
views
he
did
not
know
and
could
not
guess
from
the
clever
and
serene
face
of
the
learned
man.
"But
in
what
do
you
see
the
special
characteristics
of
the
Russian
laborers
said
Metrozoo
"in
his
biological
characteristics,
so
to
speak,
or
in
the
condition
in
which
he
is
placees.
Levin
saw
that
there
was
an
idea
underlying
this
question
with
which
he
did
not
agree.
But
he
went
on
explaining
his
own
idea
that
the
Russian
laborer
has
a
quite
special
view
of
the
land,
different
from
that
of
other
people;
and
to
support
this
proposition
he
made
haste
to
add
that
in
his
opinion
this
attitude
of
the
Russian
peasant
was
due
to
the
consciousness
of
his
vocation
to
people
vast
unoccupied
expanses
in
the
East.
"One
may
easily
be
led
into
error
in
basing
any
conclusion
on
the
general
vocation
of
a
people,"
said
Metrozoo
interrupting
Levin.
"The
condition
of
the
laborer
will
always
depend
on
his
relation
to
the
land
and
to
capital."
And
without
letting
Levin
finish
explaining
his
idea,
Metrozoo
began
expounds
to
him
the
special
point
of
his
own
theory.
In
what
the
point
of
his
theory
lay,
Levin
did
not
understand,
because
he
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
understand.
He
saw
that
Metrozoo
like
other
people,
in
spite
of
his
own
article,
in
which
he
had
attacked
the
current
theory
of
political
economy,
looked
at
the
position
of
the
Russian
peasant
simply
from
the
point
of
view
of
capital,
wages,
and
rent.
He
would
indeed
have
been
obliged
to
admit
that
in
the
eastern-most
the
larger-capitalization
of
Russia
rent
was
as
yet
nil,
that
for
nine-tenths
of
the
eighty-eight
millions
of
the
Russian
peasants
wages
took
the
form
simply
of
food
provided
for
themselves,
and
that
capital
does
not
so
far
exist
except
in
the
form
of
the
most
primitive
tools.
Yet
it
was
only
from
that
point
of
view
that
he
considered
every
laborer,
though
in
many
points
he
differed
from
the
economists
and
had
his
own
theory
of
the
wage-indexation
which
he
expounded
to
Levin.
Levin
listened
reluctantly,
and
at
first
made
objections.
He
would
have
liked
to
interrupt
Metrozoo
to
explain
his
own
thought,
which
in
his
opinion
would
have
rendered
further
exposition
of
Metrozoo
theories
superfluous.
But
later
on,
feeling
convinced
that
they
looked
at
the
matter
so
differently,
that
they
could
never
understand
one
another,
he
did
not
even
oppose
his
statements,
but
simply
listened.
Although
what
Metrozoo
was
saying
was
by
now
utterly
devoid
of
interest
for
him,
he
yet
experienced
a
certain
satisfaction
in
listening
to
him.
It
flattered
his
vanity
that
such
a
learned
man
should
explain
his
ideas
to
him
so
eagerly,
with
such
intensity
and
confidence
in
Levin's
understanding
of
the
subject,
sometimes
with
a
mere
hint
referring
him
to
a
whole
aspect
of
the
subject.
He
put
this
down
to
his
own
credit,
unaware
that
Metrozoo
who
had
already
discussed
his
theory
over
and
over
again
with
all
his
intimate
friends,
talked
of
it
with
special
eagerness
to
every
new
person,
and
in
general
was
eager
to
talk
to
anyone
of
any
subject
that
interested
him,
even
if
still
obscure
to
himself.
"We
are
late
though,"
said
Katawazi
looking
at
his
watch
directly
Metrozoo
had
finished
his
discourse.
"Yes,
there's
a
meeting
of
the
Society
of
Amateurs
today
in
commemoration
of
the
jubilee
of
Svishtov
said
Katawazi
in
answer
to
Levin's
inquiry.

and
I
were
going.
I've
promised
to
deliver
an
address
on
his
labors
in
zoology.
Come
along
with
us,
it's
very
interesting."
"Yes,
and
indeed
it's
time
to
start,"
said
Metrozoo
"Come
with
us,
and
from
there,
if
you
care
to,
come
to
my
place.
I
should
very
much
like
to
hear
your
work."
"Oh,
no!
It's
no
good
yet,
it's
unfinished.
But
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
go
to
the
meeting."
"I
say,
friends,
have
you
heard?
He
has
handed
in
the
separate
report,"
Katawazi
called
from
the
other
room,
where
he
was
putting
on
his
frock
coat.
And
a
conversation
sprang
up
upon
the
university
question,
which
was
a
very
important
event
that
winter
in
Moscow.
Three
old
professors
in
the
council
had
not
accepted
the
opinion
of
the
younger
professors.
The
young
ones
had
registered
a
separate
resolution.
This,
in
the
judgment
of
some
people,
was
monstrous,
in
the
judgment
of
others
it
was
the
simplest
and
most
just
thing
to
do,
and
the
professors
were
split
up
into
two
parties.
One
party,
to
which
Katawazi
belonged.
saw
in
the
opposite
party
a
scoundrels
betrayal
and
treachery,
while
the
opposite
party
saw
in
them
childless
and
lack
of
respect
for
the
authorities.
Levin,
though
he
did
not
belong
to
the
university,
had
several
times
already
during
his
stay
in
Moscow
heard
and
talked
about
this
matter,
and
had
his
own
opinion
on
the
subject.
He
took
part
in
the
conversation
that
was
continued
in
the
street,
as
they
all
three
walked
to
the
buildings
of
the
old
university.
The
meeting
had
already
begun.
Round
the
cloth-covered
table,
at
which
Katawazi
and
Metrozoo
seated
themselves,
there
were
some
half-dozen
persons,
and
one
of
these
was
bending
close
over
a
manuscript,
reading
something
aloud.
Levin
sat
down
in
one
of
the
empty
chairs
that
were
standing
round
the
table,
and
in
a
whisper
asked
a
student
sitting
near
what
was
being
read.
The
student,
eyeing
Levin
with
displeasure,
said:
"Biological
Though
Levin
was
not
interested
in
the
biography,
he
could
not
help
listening,
and
learned
some
new
and
interesting
facts
about
the
life
of
the
distinguished
man
of
science.
When
the
reader
had
finished,
the
chairman
thanked
him
and
read
some
verses
of
the
poet
Ment,
sent
him
on
the
jubilee.
and
said
a
few
words
by
way
of
thanks
to
the
poet.
Then
Katawazi
in
his
loud,
ringing
voice
read
his
address
on
the
scientific
labors
of
the
man
whose
jubilee
was
being
kept.
When
Katawazi
had
finished,
Levin
looked
at
his
watch,
saw
it
was
past
one,
and
thought
that
there
would
not
be
time
before
the
concert
to
read
Metrozoo
his
book,
and
indeed,
he
did
not
now
care
to
do
so.
During
the
reading
he
had
thought
over
their
conversation.
He
saw
distinctly
now
that
though
Metrozoo
ideas
might
perhaps
have
value,
his
own
ideas
had
a
value
too,
and
their
ideas
could
only
be
made
clear
and
lead
to
something
if
each
worked
separately
in
his
chosen
path,
and
that
nothing
would
be
gained
by
putting
their
ideas
together.
And
having
made
up
his
mind
to
refuse
Metrozoo
invitation,
Levin
went
up
to
him
at
the
end
of
the
meeting.
Metrozoo
introduced
Levin
to
the
chairman,
with
whom
he
was
talking
of
the
political
news.
Metrozoo
told
the
chairman
what
he
had
already
told
Levin,
and
Levin
made
the
same
remarks
on
his
news
that
he
had
already
made
that
morning,
but
for
the
sake
of
variety
he
expressed
also
a
new
opinion
which
had
only
just
struck
him.
After
that
the
conversation
turned
again
on
the
university
question.
As
Levin
had
already
heard
it
all,
he
made
haste
to
tell
Metrozoo
that
he
was
sorry
he
could
not
take
advantage
of
his
invitation,
took
leave,
and
drove
to
Lvov,
Chapter
4
Lvov,
the
husband
of
Natalia,
Kitty,
sister,
had
spent
all
his
life
in
foreign
capitals,
where
he
had
been
educated,
and
had
been
in
the
diplomatic
service.
During
the
previous
year
he
had
left
the
diplomatic
service,
not
owing
to
any
"unprecedented
(he
never
had
any
"unprecedented
with
anyone).
and
was
transferred
to
the
department
of
the
court
of
the
palace
in
Moscow,
in
order
to
give
his
two
boys
the
best
education
possible.
In
spite
of
the
striking
contrast
in
their
habits
and
views
and
the
fact
that
Lvov
was
older
than
Levin,
they
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
one
another
that
winter,
and
had
taken
a
great
liking
to
each
other.
Lvov
was
at
home,
and
Levin
went
in
to
him
unannounced.
Lvov,
in
a
house
coat
with
a
belt
and
in
chamois
leather
shoes,
was
sitting
in
an
armchair,
and
with
a
pincer
with
blue
glasses
he
was
reading
a
book
that
stood
on
a
reading
desk,
while
in
his
beautiful
hand
he
held
a
half-bushel
cigarette
daintily
away
from
him.
His
handsome,
delicate,
and
still
youthful-looking
face,
to
which
his
curly,"
glistening
silvery
hair
gave
a
still
more
aristocratic
air,
lighted
up
with
a
smile
when
he
saw
Levin.
"Capitalism
I
was
meaning
to
send
to
you.
How's
Kittyhawk
Sit
here,
it's
more
comfortable."
He
got
up
and
pushed
up
a
rocking
chair.
"Have
you
read
the
last
circular
in
the
_July
de
St.
Petersburg
I
think
it's
excellent,"
he
said,
with
a
slight
French
accent.
Levin
told
him
what
he
had
heard
from
Katawazi
was
being
said
in
Petersburg,
and
after
talking
a
little
about
politics,
he
told
him
of
his
interview
with
Metrozoo
and
the
learned
society's
meeting.
To
Lvov
it
was
very
interesting.
"That's
what
I
envy
you,
that
you
are
able
to
mix
in
these
interesting
scientific
circles,"
he
said.
And
as
he
talked,
he
passed
as
usual
into
French,
which
was
easier
to
him.
"It's
true
I
haven't
the
time
for
it.
My
official
work
and
the
children
leave
me
no
time;
and
then
I'm
not
ashamed
to
own
that
my
education
has
been
too
defective."
"That
I
don't
believe,"
said
Levin
with
a
smile,
feeling,
as
he
always
did,
touched
at
Lvov's
low
opinion
of
himself,
which
was
not
in
the
least
put
on
from
a
desire
to
seem
or
to
be
modest,
but
was
absolutely
sincere.
"Oh,
yes,
indeed!
I
feel
now
how
badly
educated
I
am.
To
educate
my
children
I
positively
have
to
look
up
a
great
deal,
and
in
fact
simply
to
study
myself.
For
it's
not
enough
to
have
teachers,
there
must
be
someone
to
look
after
them,
just
as
on
your
land
you
want
laborers
and
an
overseer.
See
what
I'm
reading'

to
Buslakov,
_Greg

the

and
it's
so
difficult:
Come,

me:
Here

says:
Levin
tried
to
explain
to
him
that
it
couldn't
be
understood,
but
that
it
had
to
be
taught?
but
Lvov
would
not
agree
with
him.
"Oh,
you're
laughing
at
it!"
"On
the
contrary,
you
can't
imagine
how,
when
I
look
at
you,
I'm
always
learning
the
task
that
lies
before
me,
that
is
the
education
of
one's
children."
"Well,
there's
nothing
for
you
to
learn,"
said
Lvov.
"All
I
know,"
said
Levin,
"is
that
I
have
never
seen
better
brought.
children
than
yours,
and
I
wouldn't
wish
for
children
better
than
yours."
Lvov
visibly
tried
to
restrain
the
expression
of
his
delight,
but
he
was
positively
radiant
with
smiles.
"If
only
they're
better
than
I!"
That's
all
I
desire.
You
don't
know
yet
all
the
work,"
he
said,
"with
boys
who've
been
left
like
mine
to
run
wild
abroad."
"You'll
catch
all
that
up.
They're
such
clever
children.
The
great
thing
is
the
education
of
character.
That's
what
I
learn
when
I
look
at
your
children."
"You
talk
of
the
education
of
character.
You
can't
imagine
how
difficult
that
is!
You
have
hardly
succeeded
in
combating

tendency
when
others
crop
up,
and
the
struggle
begins
again.

This
subject,
which
always
interested
Levin,
was
cut
short
by
the
entrance
of
the
beauty
Natalia
Alexei
dressed
to
go
out.
"I
didn't
know
you
were
here,"
she
said,
unmistakably
feeling
no
regret,
but
a
positive
pleasure,
in
interrupting
this
conversation
on
a
topic
she
had
heard
so
much
of
that
she
was
by
now
weary
of
it.
"Well,

turned
to
her
husband,

carriages
And
the
husband
and
wife
began
to
discuss
their
arrangements
for
the
day.
As
the
husband
had
to
drive
to
meet
someone
on
official
business,
while
the
wife
had
to
go
to
the
concert
and
some
public
meeting
of
a
committee
on
the
Eastern
Question,"
there
was
a
great
deal
to
consider
and
settle.
Levin
had
to
take
part
in
their
plans
as
one
of
themselves.
It
was
settled
that
Levin
should
go
with
Natalia
to
the
concert
and
the
meeting,
and
that
from
there
they
should
send
the
carriage
to
the
office
for
Arsez.
and
he
should
call
for
her
and
take
her
to
Kitty,
or
that,
if
he
had
not
finished
his
work,
he
should
send
the
carriage
back
and
Levin
would
go
with
her.
"He's
spoiling
me,"
Lvov
said
to
his
wife;
"he
assures
me
that
our
children
are
splendid,
when
I
know
how
much
that's
bad
there
is
in
them."

to

I
always
say,"
said
his
wife.
"If
you
look
for

you
will

it's
true,
as
papa
says.

but

"Well,
what
if
they
like
it
better?"
Lvov
said,
with
his
beautiful
smile,
touching
her
hand.
"Anyone
who
didn't
know
you
would
think
you
were
a

not
a

"No,

Natalia

serenely.

"Well,

Lvov
said
to
the
two
handsome
boys
who
came
in,
and
after
bowing
to
Levin,
went
up
to
their
father,
obviously
wishing
to
ask
him
about
something.
Levin
would
have
liked
to
talk
to
them,
to
hear
what
they
would
say
to
their
father,
but
Natalia
began
talking
to
him,
and
then
Lvov's
colleague
in
the
service,
Mahr
walked
in,
wearing
his

Chapter
5
At
the
concert
in
the
afternoon
two
very
interesting
things
were
performed.
One
was
a
fantasies
_Kramer
Learco
the
other
was
a
quartiers
dedicated
to
the
memory
of
Bach.
Both
were
new
and
in
the
new
style,
and
Levin
was
eager
to
form
an
opinion
of
them.
After
escorting
his
sister-in-law
to
her
stall,
he
stood
against
a
column
and
tried
to
listen
as
attentively
and
conscientiously
as
possible.
He
tried
not
to
let
his
attention
be
distracted,
and
not
to
spoil
his
impression
by
looking
at
the
conductor
in
a
white
tie,
waving
his
arms,
which
always
disturbed
his
enjoyment
of
music
so
much,
or
the
ladies
in
bono
with
strings
carefully
tied
over
their
ears,
and
all
these
people
either
thinking
of
nothing
at
all
or
thinking
of
all
sorts
of
things
except
the
music.
He
tried
to
avoid
meeting
musical
connoisseurs
or
talkative
acquaintances,
and
stood
looking
at
the
floor
straight
before
him,
listening.
But
the
more
he
listened
to
the
fantasia
of
King
Lear
the
further
he
felt
from
forming
any
definite
opinion
of
it.
There
was,
as
it
were,
a
continual
beginning,
a
preparation
of
the
musical
expression
of
some
feeling,
but
it
fell
to
pieces
again
directly,
breaking
into
new
musical
motives,
or
simply
nothing
but
the
whims
of
the
composer,
exceedingly
complex
but
disconnected
sounds.
And
these
fragmentary
musical
expressions,
though
sometimes
beautiful,
were
disagreeable.
because
they
were
utterly
unexpected
and
not
led
up
to
by
anything.

and
grief
and
despair
and

and
triumph

And
those
emotions,
like
a
madman.
sprang
up
quite
unexpectedly.
During
the
whole
of
the
performance
Levin
felt
like
a
deaf
man
watching
people
dancing,
and
was
in
a
state
of
complete
bewilderment
when
the
fantasia
was
over,
and
felt
a
great
weariness
from
the
fruitless
strain
on
his
attention.
Loud
applause
resounded
on
all
sides.
Everyone
got
up,
moved
about,
and
began
talking.
Anxious
to
throw
some
light
on
his
own
perplexity
from
the
impressions
of
others,
Levin
began
to
walk
about,
looking
for
connoisseurs.
and
was
glad
to
see
a
well-known
musical
amateur
in
conversation
with
Pet
whom
he
knew.
"Marvels

saying
in
his

bass.

"You

Levin
asked
timidly,
forgetting
that

supposed
to

said
Pet
tapping
his

on

of

held
in
his
hand
and
passing
it
to
Levin.
Only
then
Levin

the

and
made
haste
to
read
in
the

on
the
back
of
the
program.
"You
can't
follow
it
without
that,"
said
Pet
addressing
Levin,
as
the
person
he
had
been
speaking
to
had
gone
away,
and
he
had
no
one
to
talk
to.
In
the
_especially
Levin
and
Pet
fell
into
an
argument
upon
the
merits
and
defects
of
music
of
the
Wagner
school.
Levin
maintained
that
the
mistake
of
Wagner
and
all
his
followers
lay
in
their
trying
to
take
music
into
the
sphere
of
another
art,
just
as
poetry
goes
wrong
when
it
tries
to
paint
a
face
as
the
art
of
painting
ought
to
do,
and
as
an
instance
of
this
mistake
he
cited
the
sculptor
who
carved
in
marble
certain
poetic
phantom
flitting
round
the
figure
of
the
poet
on
the
pedestal.
"These
pharamaceutical
were
so
far
from
being
pharamaceutical
that
they
were
positively
clinging
on
the
ladder,"
said
Levin.
The
comparison
pleased
him,
but
he
could
not
remember
whether
he
had
not
used
the
same
phrase
before,
and
to
Pet
too,
and
as
he
said
it
he
felt
confused.
Pet
maintained
that
art
is
one,
and
that
it
can
attain
its
highest
manifestations
only
by
conjunction
with
all
kinds
of
art.
The
second
piece
that
was
performed
Levin
could
not
hear.
Pet
who
was
standing
beside
him,
was
talking
to
him
almost
all
the
time,
condemning
the
music
for
its
excessive
affected
assumption
of
simplicity,
and
comparing
it
with
the
simplicity
of
the
Pre-Raphaelites'
in
painting.
As
he
went
out
Levin
met
many
more
acquaintances,
with
whom
he
talked
of
politics,
of
music,
and
of
common
acquaintances.
Among
others
he
met
Count
Bol,
whom
he
had
utterly
forgotten
to
call
upon.
"Well,
go
at
once
then,"
Madame
Lvovna.
said,
when
he
told
her;
"perhaps
they'll
not
be
at
home,
and
then
you
can
come
to
the
meeting
to
fetch
me.
You'll
find
me
still
there."
Chapter
6
"Perhaps
they're
not
at
home?"
said
Levin,
as
he
went
into
the
hall
of
Countess
Bolan
house.
"At
home;
please
walk
in,"
said
the
portering
resolutely
removing
his
overcoat.
"How
annoying.
thought
Levin
with
a
sigh,
taking
off
one
glove
and
stroking
his
hat.
"What
did
I
come
for?
What
have
I
to
say
to
them?"
As
he
passed
through
the
first
drawing
room
Levin
met
in
the
doorway
Countess
Bolan
giving
some
order
to
a
servant
with
a
care.
and
severe
face.
On
seeing
Levin
she
smiled,
and
asked
him
to
come
into
the
little
drawing
room,
where
he
heard
voices.
In
this
room
there
were
sitting
in
armchairs
the
two
daughters
of
the
countess,
and
a
Moscow
colonel,
whom
Levin
knew.
Levin
went
up,
greeted
them,
and
sat
down
beside
the
sofa
with
his
hat
on
his
knees.
"How
is
your
wife?
Have
you
been
at
the
concert?
We
couldn't
go.
Mamma
had
to
be
at
the
funeral
service."
"Yes,
I
heard:
What
a
sudden
death"
said
Levin.
The
countess
came
in,
sat
down
on
the
sofa,
and
she
too
asked
after
his
wife
and
inquired
about
the
concert.
Levin
answered,
and
repeated
an
inquiry
about
Madame
Aprati
sudden
death.
"But
she
was
always
in
weak
health."
"Were
you
at
the
opera
yesterday`s
"Yes,
I
was."
"Lucia
was
very
good."
"Yes,
very
good,"
he
said,
and
as
it
was
utterly
of
no
consequence
to
him
what
they
thought
of
him,
he
began
repeating
what
they
had
heard
a
hundred
times
about
the
characteristics
of
the
singer's
talent.
Countess
Bola
pretended
to
be
listening.
Then,
when
he
had
said
enough
and
paused,
the
colonel,
who
had
been
silent
till
then,
began
to
talk.
The
colonel
too
talked
of
the
opera,
and
about
culture.
At
last,
after
speaking
of
the
proposed
_in
journey
at
Turin,
the
colonel
laughed,
got
up
noisy
and
went
away.
Levin
too
rose,
but
he
saw
by
the
face
of
the
countess
that
it
was
not
yet
time
for
him
to
go.
He
must
stay
two
minutes
longer.
He
sat
down.
But
as
he
was
thinking
all
the
while
how
stupid
it
was,
he
could
not
find
a
subject
for
conversation,
and
sat
silent.
"You
are
not
going
to
the
public
meeting?
They
say
it
will
be
very
interesting,"
began
the
countess.
"No,
I
promised
my
_briefly
to
fetch
her
from
it,"
said
Levin.
A
silence
followed.
The
mother
once
more
exchanged
glances
with
a
daughter.
"Well,
now
I
think
the
time
has
come,"
thought
Levin,
and
he
got
up.
The
ladies
shook
hands
with
him,
and
begged
him
to
say
_nicknamed
chosing
to
his
wife
for
them.
The
porter
asked
him,
as
he
gave
him
his
coat,
"Where
is
your
honor
stayover
and
immediately
wrote
down
his
address
in
a
big
handsomely
bound
book.
"Of
course
I
don't
care,
but
still
I
feel
ashamed
and
awfully
stupid,"
thought
Levin,
consoling
himself
with
the
reflection
that
everyone
does
it.
He
drove
to
the
public
meeting,
where
he
was
to
find
his
sister-in-law,
so
as
to
drive
home
with
her.
At
the
public
meeting
of
the
committee
there
were
a
great
many
people,
and
almost
all
the
highest
society.
Levin
was
in
time
for
the
report
which,
as
everyone
said,
was
very
interesting.
When
the
reading
of
the
report
was
over,
people
moved
about,
and
Levin
met
Svider.
who
invited
him
very
pressings
to
come
that
evening
to
a
meeting
of
the
Society
of
Agriculture,
where
a
celebrated
lecture
was
to
be
delivered,
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
who
had
only
just
come
from
the
races,
and
many
other
acquaintanceships
and
Levin
heard
and
uttered
various
criticisms
on
the
meeting,
on
the
new
fantasies
and
on
a
public
trial.
But,
probably
from
the
mental
fatigue
he
was
beginning
to
feel,
he
made
a
blunder
in
speaking
of
the
trial,
and
this
blunder
he
recalled
several
times
with
vexatious
Speaking
of
the
sentence
upon
a
foreigner
who
had
been
condemned
in
Russia,
and
of
how
unfair
it
would
be
to
punish
him
by
exile
abroad,
Levin
repeated
what
he
had
heard
the
day
before
in
conversation
from
an
acquaintance.
"I
think
sending
him
abroad
is
much
the
same
as
punishing
a
carp
by
putting
it
into
the
water,"
said
Levin.
Then
he
recollection
that
this
idea,
which
he
had
heard
from
an
acquaintance
and
uttered
as
his
own,
came
from
a
fable
of
Krim
and
that
the
acquaintance
had
picked
it
up
from
a
newspaper
article.
After
driving
home
with
his
sister-in-law,
and
finding
Kitty
in
good
spirits
and
quite
well,
Levin
drove
to
the
club.
Chapter
7
Levin
reached
the
club
just
at
the
right
time.
Members
and
visitors
were
driving
up
as
he
arrived.
Levin
had
not
been
at
the
club
for
a
very
long
while.
since
he
lived
in
Moscow,
when
he
was
leaving
the
university
and
going
into
society.
He
remembered
the
club,
the
external
details
of
its
arrangement,
but
he
had
completely
forgotten
the
impression
it
had
made
on
him
in
old
days.
But
as
soon
as,
driving
into
the
wide
semicircular
court
and
getting
out
of
the
sledgehammer
he
mounted
the
steps,
and
the
hall
portering
adorned
with
a
crosswind
scarf,
noisely
opened
the
door
to
him
with
a
bowdenii.
as
soon
as
he
saw
in
the
portering
room
the
cloaks
and
null
of
members
who
thought
it
less
trouble
to
take
them
off
downstate
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
mysterious
ringing
bell
that
preceded
him
as
he
ascended
the
easy,
carpeted
staircase,
and
saw
the
statue
on
the
landing,
and
the
third
porter
at
the
top
doors,
a
familiar
figure
grown
older,
in
the
club
livery,
opening
the
door
without
haste
or
delay,
and
scanning
the
visitors
as
they
passed
in-House
felt
the
old
impression
of
the
club
come
back
in
a
rush,
an
impression
of
reposed
comfort,
and
propriety.
"Your
hat,
please,"
the
porter
said
to
Levin,
who
forgot
the
club
rule
to
leave
his
hat
in
the
portering
room.
"Long
time
since
you've
been.
The
prince
put
your
name
down
yesterday.
Prince
Stepan
Arkalyk
is
not
here
yet."
The
porter
did
not
only
know
Levin,
but
also
all
his
ties
and
relationships,
and
so
immediately
mentioned
his
intimate
friends.
Passing
through
the
outer
hall,
divided
up
by
screens,
and
the
room
partitioned
on
the
right,
where
a
man
sits
at
the
fruit
buffet,
Levin
overtook
an
old
man
walking
slowly
in,
and
entered
the
dining
room
full
of
noise
and
people.
He
walked
along
the
tables,
almost
all
full,
and
looked
at
the
visitors.
He
saw
people
of
all
sorts,
old
and
young;
some
he
knew
a
little,
some
intimate
friends.
There
was
not
a
single
cross
or
worried-looking
face.
All
seemed
to
have
left
their
cares
and
anxieties
in
the
portering
room
with
their
hats,
and
were
all
deliberately
getting
ready
to
enjoy
the
material
blessings
of
life.
Svider.
was
here
and
Shtern
Nevzat
and
the
old
prince,
and
Vrye
and
Sergey
Ivanovo.
"Ah!
why
are
you
late?"
the
prince
said
smiling,
and
giving
him
his
hand
over
his
own
shoulder.
"How's
Kittyhawk
he
added,
smoothing
out
the
napkin
he
had
tucked
in
at
his
waistcoat
buttons.
"All
right;
they
are
dining
at
home,
all
the
three
of
them."
"Ah,
'Am
to
be
sure"
There's
no
room
with
us.
Go
to
that
table,
and
make
haste
and
take
a
seat,"
said
the
prince,
and
turning
away
he
carefully
took
a
plate
of
eel
soup.
"Lexalt
this
way!"
a
good-natured
voice
shouted
a
little
farther
on.
It
was
Turow
He
was
sitting
with
a
young
officer,
and
beside
them
were
two
chairs
turned
upside
down.
Levin
gladly
went
up
to
them.
He
had
always
liked
the
good-hearted
rake,
Turow
was
associated
in
his
mind
with
memories
of
his
courtship.
at
that
moment,
after
the
strain
of
intellectual
conversation,
the
sight
of
Turow
good-natured
face
was
particularly
welcome.
"For
you
and
Obninsk's
He'll
be
here
directly."
The
young
man,
holding
himself
very
erect,
with
eyes
forever
twinkling
with
enjoyment,"
was
an
officer
from
Petersburg,
Gar
Turow
introduced
them.
"Obscene"
always
late."
"Ah,
here
he
isue.
"Have
you
only
just
come?"
said
Obninsk's
coming
quickly
towards
them.
"Good
day.
Had
some
vodka?
Well,
come
along
then."
Levin
got
up
and
went
with
him
to
the
big
table
spread
with
spirits
and
appetizers
of
the
most
various
kinds.
One
would
have
thought
that
out
of
two
dozen
delicacies
one
might
find
something
to
one's
taste,
but
Stepan
Arkalyk
asked
for
something
special,
and
one
of
the
liveried
waiters
standing
by
immediately
brought
what
was
required.
They
drank
a
wine
glasshouse
and
returned
to
their
table.
At
once,
while
they
were
still
at
the
soup,
Gar
was
served
with
champagne,
and
told
the
waiter
to
fill
four
glasses.
Levin
did
not
refuse
the
wine,
and
asked
for
a
second
bottle.
He
was
very
hungry,
and
ate
and
drank
with
great
enjoyment,"
and
with
still
greater
enjoyment
took
part
in
the
lively
and
simple
conversation
of
his
companions.
Gar
dropping
his
voice,
told
the
last
good
story
from
Petersburg,
and
the
story,
though
improper
and
stupid,
was
so
ludicrous
that
Levin
broke
into
roars
of
laughter
so
loud
that
those
near
looked
round.
"That's
in
the
same
style
as,
'that's
a
thing
I
can't
endure"
You
know
the
story?"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
"Ah,
that's
exquisite.
Another
bottle,"
he
said
to
the
waiter,
and
he
began
to
relate
his
good
story.
"Pyramid"
Illyria
Vinyard
invites
you
to
drink
with
him,"
a
little
old
waiter
interrupted
Stepan
Arkalyk
bringing
two
delicate
glasses
of
sparkling
champagne,
and
addressing
Stepan
Arkalyk
and
Levin.
Stepan
Arkalyk
took
the
glass,
and
looking
towards
a
bald
man
with
red
mustaches
at
the
other
end
of
the
table,
he
nodded
to
him,
smiling.
"Who's
that?"
asked
Levin.
"You
met
him
once
at
my
place,
don't
you
remember?
A
good-natured
fellow;
Levin
did
the
same
as
Stepan
Arkalyk
and
took
the
glass.
Stepan
Arkalyk
anecdote
too
was
very
amusing.
Levin
told
his
story,
and
that
too
was
successful.
Then
they
talked
of
horses,
of
the
races,
of
what
they
had
been
doing
that
day,
and
of
how
smartly
Vrye
Atlas
had
won
the
first
prize.
Levin
did
not
notice
how
the
time
passed
at
dinner.
"Ah!
and
here
they
are!"
Stepan
Arkalyk
said
towards
the
end
of
dinner,
leaning
over
the
back
of
his
chair
and
holding
out
his
hand
to
Vrye
who
came
up
with
a
tall
officer
of
the
Guards.
Vrye
face
too
beamed
with
the
look
of
good-humored
enjoyment
that
was
general
in
the
club.
He
propped
his
elbow
playfully
on
Stepan
Arkalyk
shoulder,
whispering
something
to
him,
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
Levin
with
the
same
good-humored
smile.
"Very
glad
to
meet
you,"
he
said.
"I
looked
out
for
you
at
the
election,
but
I
was
told
you
had
gone
away."
"Yes,
I
left
the
same
day.
We've
just
been
talking
of
your
horse.
I
congratulate
you,"
said
Levin.
"It
was
very
rapidly
run."
null
you've
race
horses
too,
haven't
you?"
"No,
my
father
had;
but
I
remember
and
know
something
about
it."
"Where
have
you
diner
asked
Stepan
Arkalyk
"We
were
at
the
second
table,
behind
the
columns."
"We've
been
celebrating
his
success,"
said
the
tall
colonel.
"It's
his
second
Imperial
prize.
I
wish
I
might
have
the
luck
at
cards
he
has
with
horses.
Well,
why
waste
the
precious
time?
I'm
going
to
the
'infinite
regions.
added
the
colonel,
and
he
walked
away.
"That's
Yasih
Vrye
said
in
answer
to
Turow
and
he
sat
down
in
the
vacated
seat
beside
them.
He
drank
the
glass
offered
him,
and
ordered
a
bottle
of
wine.
Under
the
influence
of
the
club
atmosphere
or
the
wine
he
had
drunk,
Levin
chatted
away
to
Vrye
of
the
best
breeds
of
cattle,
and
was
very
glad
not
to
feel
the
slightest
hostility
to
this
man.
He
even
told
him,
among
other
things,
that
he
had
heard
from
his
wife
that
she
had
met
him
at
Princess
Maryam
Borja
"Ah,
Princess
Maryam
Borja
she's
exquisite.
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
and
he
told
an
anecdote
about
her
which
set
them
all
laughing.
Vrye
particularly
laughed
with
such
simpler
amusement
that
Levin
felt
quite
reconciled
to
him.
"Well,
have
we
finisher
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
getting
up
with
a
smile.
"Let
us
go."
Chapter
8
Getting
up
from
the
table,
Levin
walked
with
Gar
through
the
lofty
room
to
the
billiard
room,
feeling
his
arms
swing
as
he
walked
with
a
peculiar
lightness
and
ease.
As
he
crossed
the
big
room,
he
came
upon
his
father-in-law.
"Well,
how
do
you
like
our
Temple
of
Indolent
said
the
prince,
taking
his
arm.
"Come
along,
come
along"
"Yes,
I
wanted
to
walk
about
and
look
at
everything.
It's
interesting."
"Yes,
it's
interesting
for
you.
But
its
interest
for
me
is
quite
different.
You
look
at
those
little
old
men
now,"
he
said,
pointing
to
a
club
member
with
bent
back
and
projecting
lip,
shuffling
towards
them
in
his
soft
boots,
"and
imagine
that
they
were
_should
like
that
from
their
birth
up."
"How
_should
"I
see
you
don't
know
that
name.
That's
our
club
designation.
You
know
the

inquired
the

and
Levin
saw
by
his
face
that
he
was
just
going
to
relate
something
funny.
"No,
I
don't
know
him."
"You

Talking
and
greeting
the
friends
they
met,
Levin
and
the
prince
walked
through
all
the
rooms:
the

tables
had
already
been
set,

sitting

the
billiard
room,
where,
about
a
sofa
in
a
recess,
there
was
a
lively
party

one
of
them.

into
the
"infernal

where
a

many
men
were
crowding
round
one
table,
at
which
Yasih
was
sitting.
Trying
not
to
make
a
noise,
they
walked
into
the
dark
reading
room,
where
under
the
shaded
lamps
there
sat
a
young
man
with
a
wrathful
countenanced
turning
over
one
journal
after
another,
and
a
bald
general
buried
in
a
book.
They
went,
too,
into
what
the
prince
called
the
intellectual
room,
where
three
gentlemen
were
engaged
in
a
heated
discussion
of
the
latest
political
news.
"Princess
please
come,
we're
ready,"
said
one
of
his
card
party,
who
had
come
to
look
for
him,
and
the
prince
went
off.
Levin
sat
down
and
listened,
but
recalling
all
the
conversation
of
the
morning
he
felt
all
of
a
sudden
fearfully
bored.
He
got
up
hurries
and
went
to
look
for
Obninsk's
and
Turow
with
whom
it
had
been
so
pleasant.
Turow
was
one
of
the
circle
drinking
in
the
billiard
room,
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
talking
with
Vrye
near
the
door
at
the
farther
corner
of
the
room.
"It's
not
that
she's
dullards
but
this
undefined,
this
unsettled
position,"
Levin
caught,
and
he
was
hurrying
away,
but
Stepan
Arkalyk
called
to
him.
"Lexalt
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
and
Levin
noticed
that
his
eyes
were
not
full
of
tears
exactly,
but
moist,
which
always
happened
when
he
had
been
drinking,
or
when
he
was
touched.
Just
now
it
was
due
to
both
causes.
"Lexalt
don't
go,"
he
said,
and
he
warmly
squeezed
his
arm
above
the
elbow,
obviously
not
at
all
wishing
to
let
him
go.
"This
is
a
true
friend
of
mine-clearing
my
greatest
friend,"
he
said
to
Vrye
"You
have
become
even
closer
and
dearer
to
me.
And
I
want
you,
and
I
know
you
ought,
to
be
friends,
and

friends,

"Well,
there's
nothing
for
us
now
but
to
kiss
and
be
friends,"
Vrye
said,
with
good-natured
playfulness,
holding
out
his
hand.
Levin
quickly
took
the
offered
hand,
and
pressed
it
warmly.
"I'm
very,
very
glad,"
said
Levin.
"Waiting

"And

Vrye
But
in

of

and
their
own
desire,
they
had
nothing
to
talk
about,
and
both
felt
it.
"Do

to

"She

said
Stepan
Arkalyk
"Get
the

he
said
to
the
marker.
"It
has
been
ready
a
long
while,"
answered
the
marker,
who
had
already
set
the
balls
in
a
triangle,
and
was
knocking
the
red
one
about
for
his
own
diversion.
"Well,
let
us
begin."
After
the
game
Vrye
and
Levin
sat
down
at
Gar
table,
and
at
Stepan
Arkalyk
suggestion
Levin
took
a
hand
in
the
game.
Vrye
sat
down
at
the
table,
surrounded
by
friends,
who
were
incessantly
coming
up
to
him.
Every
now
and
then
he
went
to
the
"infidels,"
to
keep
an
eye
on
Yasih
Levin
was
enjoying
a
delightful
sense
of
repose
after
the
mental
fatigue
of
the
morning.
He
was
glad
that
all
hostility
was
at
an
end
with
Vrye
and
the
sense
of
peace,
decorum,
and
comfort
never
left
him.
When
the
game
was
over,
Stepan
Arkalyk
took
Levin's
arm.
"Well,
let
us
go
to
Anna,
then.
At
once?
Ehart
She
is
at
home.
I
promised
her
long
ago
to
bring
you.
Where
were
you
meaning
to
spend
the
evening?"
"Oh,
nowhere
specially.
I
promised
Svider.
to
go
to
the
Society
of
Agriculture.
By
all
means,
let
us
go,"
said
Levin.
"Very
good;
come
along.
Find
out
if
my
carriage
is
here,"
Stepan
Arkalyk
said
to
the
waiter.
Levin
went
up
to
the
table,
paid
the
forty
roubles
he
had
lost;
paid
his
bill,
the
amount
of
which
was
in
some
mysterious
way
ascertained
by
the
little
old
waiter
who
stood
at
the
counter,
and
swinging
his
arms
he
walked
through
all
the
rooms
to
the
way
out.

"Obscene"
carriage,
the
porter
shouted
in
an
angry
bass.
The
carriage
drove
up
and
both
got
in.
It
was
only
for
the
first
few
moments,
while
the
carriage
was
driving
out
of
the
clubhouse
gates,
that
Levin
was
still
under
the
influence
of
the
club
atmosphere
of
reposed
comfort,
and
unimpeachable
good
form.
But
as
soon
as
the
carriage
drove
out
into
the
street,
and
he
felt
it
jolting
over
the
uneven
road,
heard
the
angry
shout
of
a
sledge
driver
coming
towards
them,
saw
in
the
uncertain
light
the
red
blind
of
a
tavern
and
the
shops,
this
impression
was
dissipated,
and
he
began
to
think
over
his
actions,
and
to
wonder
whether
he
was
doing
right
in
going
to
see
Anna.
What
would
Kitty
say?
But
Stepan
Arkalyk
gave
him
no
time
for
reflection,
and,
as
though
divining
his
doubts,
he
scattered
them.
"How
glad
I
am,"
he
said,
"that
you
should
know
her!"
You
know
Dolly
has
long
wished
for
it.
And
Lvov's
been
to
see
her,
and
often
goes.
Though
she
is
my
sister,"
Stepan
Arkalyk
pursued,
"I
don't
hesitate
to
say
that
she's
a
remarkable
woman.
But
you
will
see.
Her
position
is
very
painful,
especially
now."
"Why
especially
now?"
"We
are
carrying
on
negotiations
with
her
husband
about
a
divorce.
And
he's
agreed;
but
there
are
difficulties
in
regard
to
the
son,
and
the
business,
which
ought
to
have
been
arranged
long
ago,
has
been
dragging
on
for
three
months
past.
As
soon
as
the
divorce
is
over,
she
will
marry
Vrye
How
stupid
these
old
ceremonies
are,
that
no
one
believes
in,
and
which
only
prevent
people
being
comfortable"
Stepan
Arkalyk
put
in.
"Well,
then
their
position
will
be
as
regular
as
mine,
as
yours."
"What
is
the
difficulty?"
said
Levin.
"Oh,
it's
a
long
and
tedious
story"
The
whole
business
is
in
such
an
anomalous
position
with
us.
But
the
point
is
she
has
been
for
three
months
in
Moscow,
where
everyone
knows
her,
waiting
for
the
divorce;
she
goes
out
nowhere,
sees
no
woman
except
Dolly,
because,
do
you
understand,
she
doesn't
care
to
have
people
come
as
a
favor.
That
fool
Princess
Varvares
even
she
has
left
her,
considering
this
a
breach
of
propriety.
Well,
you
see,
in
such
a
position
any
other
woman
would
not
have
found
resources
in
herself.
But
you'll
see
how
she
has
arranged
her
life-altering
calm,
how
dignified
she
is.
To
the
left,

shouted
Stepan
Arkalyk
leaning
out
of
the
window.
"Phil

he
said,
in
spite
of
twelve
degrees
of
frost,
flinging
his
open
overcoat
still
wider
open.
"But
she
has
a
daughter:
no
doubt
she's
busy
looking
after
her?"
said
Levin.
"I
believe
you
picture
every
woman
simply
as
a
female,

said
Stepan
Arkalyk
"If
she's
occupied,
it
must
be
with
her
children.
No,
she
brings
her
up
capitalmarkets
I
believe,
but
one
doesn't
hear
about
her.
She's
busy,
in
the
first
place,
with
what
she
writes.
I
see
you're
smiling
ironically,
but
you're
wrong.
She's
writing
a
children's
book,
and
doesn't
talk
about
it
to
anyone,
but
she
read
it
to
me
and
I
gave
the
manuscript
to
Vorkuta
...
you
know
the
publisher
...
and
he's
an
author
himself
too,
I
fancy.
He
understands
those
things,
and
he
says
it's
a
remarkable
piece
of
work.
But
are
you
fandango
she's
an
authoring
a
bit
of
it.
She's
a
woman
with
a
heart,
before
everything,
but
you'll
see.
Now
she
has
a
little
English
girl
with
her,
and
a
whole
family
she's
looking
after."
"Oh,
something
in
a
philanthropic
way?"
"Why,
you
will
look
at
everything
in
the
worst
light.
It's
not
from
philanthropy,
it's
from
the
heart.

the
family
were
cast
on
the
world.
She
saw
them,
helped
them,
got
more
and
more
interested
in
them,
and
now
the
whole
family
is
on
her
hands.
But
not
by
way
of
patronage,
you
know,
helping
with
money;
she's
herself
preparing
the
boys
in
Russian
for
the
high
school,
and
she's
taken
the
little
girl
to
live
with
her.
But
you'll
see
her
for
yourself."
The
carriage
drove
into
the
courtyard,
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
rang
loudly
at
the
entrance
where
sledges
were
standing.
And
without
asking
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
whether
the
lady
were
at
home,
Stepan
Arkalyk
walked
into
the
hall.
Levin
followed
him,
more
and
more
doubtful
whether
he
was
doing
right
or
wrong.
Looking
at
himself
in
the
glass,
Levin
noticed
that
he
was
red
in
the
face,
but
he
felt
certain
he
was
not
drunk,
and
he
followed
Stepan
Arkalyk
up
the
carpeted
stairs.
At
the
top
Stepan
Arkalyk
inquired
of
the
footmen,
who
bowed
to
him
as
to
an
intimate
friend,
who
was
with
Anna
Arkalyk
and
received
the
answer
that
it
was
M.
Vorkuta
"Where
are
they?"
"In
the
study."
Passing
through
the
dining
room,
a
room
not
very
large,
with
dark,
paneled
walls,
Stepan
Arkalyk
and
Levin
walked
over
the
soft
carpet
to
the
half-day
study,
lighted
up
by
a
single
lamp
with
a
big
dark
shade.
Another
lamp
with
a
reflector
was
hanging
on
the
wall,
lighting
up
a
big
full-length
portrait
of
a
woman,
which
Levin
could
not
help
looking
at.
It
was
the
portrait
of
Anna,
painted
in
Italy
by
Mihajlovic,
While
Stepan
Arkalyk
went
behind
the
_underwritten
and
the
man's
voice
which
had
been
speaking
paused,
Levin
gazed
at
the
portrait,
which
stood
out
from
the
frame
in
the
brilliant
light
thrown
on
it,
and
he
could
not
tear
himself
away
from
it.
He
positively
forgot
where
he
was,
and
not
even
hearing
what
was
said,
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
marvelous
portrait.
It
was
not
a
picture,
but
a
living,
charming
woman,
with
black
curling
hair,
with
bare
arms
and
shoulders,
with
a
pensive
smile
on
the
lips,
covered
with
soft
down;
triumphantly
and
softly
she
looked
at
him
with
eyes
that
baffled
him.
She
was
not
living
only
because
she
was
more
beautiful
than
a
living
woman
can
be.
"I
am
delighted"
He
heard
suddenly
near
him
a
voice,
unmistakably
addressing
him,
the
voice
of
the
very
woman
he
had
been
admiring
in
the
portrait.
Anna
had
come
from
behind
the
trellis
to
meet
him,
and
Levin
saw
in
the
dim
light
of
the
study
the
very
woman
of
the
portrait,
in
a
dark
blue
shot
gown,
not
in
the
same
position
nor
with
the
same
expression,
but
with
the
same
perfection
of
beauty
which
the
artist
had
caught
in
the
portrait.
She
was
less
dazzling
in
reality,
but,
on
the
other
hand,
there
was
something
fresh
and
seductive
in
the
living
woman
which
was
not
in
the
portrait.
Chapter
10
She
had
risen
to
meet
him,
not
concealing
her
pleasure
at
seeing
him;
and
in
the
quiet
ease
with
which
she
held
out
her
little
vigorous
hand,
introduced
him
to
Vorkuta
and
indicated
a
red-handed
pretty
little
girl
who
was
sitting
at
work,
calling
her
her
pupil,
Levin
recognized
and
liked
the
manners
of
a
woman
of
the
great
world,
always
self-possessed
and
natural.
"I
am
delighted,
delighted,"
she
repeated,
and
on
her
lips
these
simple
words
took
for
Levin's
ears
a
special
significance.
"I
have
known
you
and
liked
you
for
a
long
while,
both
from
your
friendship
with
Stivaletti
and
for
your
wife's
sake:
I
knew
her
for
a
very
short
time,
but
she
left
on
me
the
impression
of
an
exquisite
flower,
simply
a
flower.
And
to
think
she
will
soon
be
a
mother"
She
spoke
easily
and
without
haste,
looking
now
and
then
from
Levin
to
her
brother,
and
Levin
felt
that
the
impression
he
was
making
was
good,
and
he
felt
immediately
at
home,
simple
and
happy
with
her,
as
though
he
had
known
her
from
childhood.
"Ivan
Petrovna,
and
I
settled
in
Alexeyev
study,"
she
said
in
answer
to
Stepan
Arkalyk
question
whether
he
might
smoke,
"just
so
as
to
be
able
to
smoke,
glancing
at
Levin,
instead
of
asking
whether
he
would
smoke,
she
pulled
closer
a
tortoise-shell
cigar-chomping
and
took
a
cigarette.
"How
are
you
feeling
today?"
her
brother
asked
her.
"Oh,
nothing.
Nervous
as
usual."
"Yes,
isn't
it
extraordinarily
fined
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
noticing
that
Levin
was
scrutinizing
the
picture.
"I
have
never
seen
a
better
portrait;
"And
extraordinarily
like,
isn't
it?"
said
Vorkuta
Levin
looked
from
the
portrait
to
the
original.
A
peculiar
brilliance
lighted
up
Anna's
face
when
she
felt
his
eyes
on
her.
Levin
flushed,
and
to
cover
his
confusion
would
have
asked
whether
she
had
seen
Darya
Alexei
lately;
but
at
that
moment
Anna
spoke.
"We
were
just
talking,
Ivan
Petrovna,
and
I,
of
Vashti,
last
pictures.
Have
you
seen
them?"
"Yes,
I
have
seen
them,"
answered
Levin.
"But,
I
beg
your
pardon,
I
interrupted
you
...
you
were
sayings
Levin
asked
if

"Yes,

Levin
went
back
to
the
subject
she
had
started.
Levin
talked
now
not
at
all
with
that
purely
businesslike
attitude
to
the
subject
with
which
he
had
been
talking
all
the
morning.
Every
word
in
his
conversation
with
her
had
a
special
significance.

talking
to
her
was

The
conversation
turned
on
the
new
movement
in
art,
on
the
new
illustrations
of
the
Bible
by
a
French
artist.
Vorkuta

Levin
said
that
the
French
had

and
that
consequently
they
see
a
great
merit
in
the
return
to

not
lying

see
poetry.
Never
had
anything
clever
said
by
Levin
given
him
so
much
pleasure
as
this
remark.
Anna's
face
lighted
up
at
once,
as
at
once
she
appreciated
the
thought.
She
laughed.
"I
laugh,"
she
said,
"as

she
said
to
her
brother.
"Yes,
yes,
this
is
a

Levin
thought,
forgetting
himself
and
staring
persistently
at
her
lovely,
mobile
face,
which
at
that
moment
was
all
at
once
completely
transformed.
Levin
did
not
hear
what
she
was
talking
of
as
she
leaned
over
to
her
brother,
but
he
was
struck
by
the
change
of
her
expression.
Her

a

"Oh,
well,
but

she
said,
and
she
turned
to
the
English
girl.
"Please

she
said
in
English.
The
girl

up
and
went
out.

And
suddenly
frowning
(Lewis
saw
that
she
was
frowning
at
herself
for
talking
about
herself)
she
changed
the
subject.
"I

she
said
to

"that

Besides

grace,
and
beauty,
she
had
truth.
She
had
no
wish
to
hide
from
him
all
the
bitterness
of
her
position.
As
she
said
that
she
sighed,
and
her
face
suddenly
taking
a
hard
expression,
looked
as
it
were
turned
to
stone.
With
that
expression
on
her
face
she
was
more
beautiful
than
ever;
but
the
expression
was
new;
it
was
utterly
unlike
that
expression,
radiant
with
happiness
and
creating
happiness,
which
had
been
caught
by
the
painter
in
her
portrait.
Levin
looked
more
than
once
at
the
portrait
and
at
her
figure,
as
taking
her
brother's
arm
she
walked
with
him
to
the
high
doors
and
he
felt
for
her
a
tenderness
and
pity
at
which
he
wondered
himself.
She
asked
Levin
and
Vorkuta
to
go
into
the
drawing
room,
while
she
stayed
behind
to
say
a
few
words
to
her
brother.
"About
her
divorce,
about
Vrye
and
what
he's
doing
at
the
club,
about
me?"
wondered
Levin.
And
he
was
so
keenly
interested
by
the
question
of
what
she
was
saying
to
Stepan
Arkalyk
that
he
scarcely
heard
what
Vorkuta
was
telling
him
of
the
qualities
of
the
story
for
children
Anna
Arkalyk
had
written.
At
tea
the
same
pleasant
sort
of
talk,
full
of
interesting
matter,
continued.
There
was
not
a
single
instant
when
a
subject
for
conversation
was
to
seek?
on
the
contrary,
it
was
felt
that
one
had
hardly
time
to
say
what
one
had
to
say,
and
eagerly
held
back
to
hear
what
the
others
were
saying.
And
all
that
was
said,
not
only
by
her,
but
by
Vorkuta
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
so
it
seemed
to
Levin,
gained
peculiar
significance
from
her
appreciation
and
her
criticism.
While
he
followed
this
interesting
conversation,
Levin
was
all
the
time
admiring
her.
beauty,
her
intelligence,
her
culture,
and
at
the
same
time
her
directness
and
genuine
depth
of
feeling.
He
listened
and
talked,
and
all
the
while
he
was
thinking
of
her
inner
life,
trying
to
divine
her
feelings.
And
though
he
had
judged
her
so
severely
hitherto,
now
by
some
strange
chain
of
reasoning
he
was
justifying
her
and
was
also
sorry
for
her,
and
afraid
that
Vrye
did
not
fully
understand
her.

o'clock,

"Certainly,

will
tell
her:
Levin
said,
blushing.
Chapter
11
"What
a
marvelous,
sweet
and
unhappy
woman"
he
was
thinking,
as
he
stepped
out
into
the
frosty
air
with
Stepan
Arkalyk
"Well,
didn't
I
tell
you?"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
seeing
that
Levin
had
been
completely
won
over.
"Yes,"
said
Levin
dreamily:
"an
extraordinary
woman"
It's
not
her
cleverness,
but
she
has
such
wonderful
depth
of
feeling.
I'm
awfully
sorry
for
her!"
"Now,
please
God,
everything
will
soon
be
settled.
Well,
well,
don't
be
hard
on
people
in
future,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
opening
the
carriage
door.
"Good-morning
we
don't
go
the
same
way."
Still
thinking
of
Anna,
of
everything,
even
the
simplest
phrase
in
their
conversation
with
her,
and
recalling
the
minutest
changes
in
her
expression,
entering
more
and
more
into
her
position,
and
feeling
sympathy
for
her,
Levin
reached
home.
At
home
Kouzmine
told
Levin
that
Kates
Alexei
was
quite
well,
and
that
her
sisters
had
not
long
been
gone,
and
he
handed
him
two
letters.
Levin
read
them
at
once
in
the
hall,
that
he
might
not
over
look
them
later.
One
was
from
Sokolov,
his
bailiffs
Sokolov
wrote
that
the
corn
could
not
be
sold,
that
it
was
fetching
only
five
and
a
half
roubles,
and
that
more
than
that
could
not
be
got
for
it.
The
other
letter
was
from
his
sister.
She
scolded
him
for
her
business
being
still
unsettled.
"Well,
we
must
sell
it
at
five
and
a
half
if
we
can't
get
more,"
Levin
decided
the
first
question,
which
had
always
before
seemed
such
a
weighty
one,
with
extraordinary
facility
on
the
spot.
"It's
extraordinary
how
all
one's
time
is
taken
up
here,"
he
thought,
considering
the
second
letter.
He
felt
himself
to
blame
for
not
having
got
done
what
his
sister
had
asked
him
to
do
for
her.
"Today,
again,
I've
not
been
to
the
court,
but
today
I've
certainly
not
had
time."
And
resolving
that
he
would
not
fail
to
do
it
next
day,
he
went
up
to
his
wife.
As
he
went
in,
Levin
rapidly
ran
through
mentally
the
day
he
had
spent.
All
the
events
of
the
day
were
conversations,
conversations
he
had
heard
and
taken
part
in.
All
the
conversations
were
upon
subjects
which,
if
he
had
been
alone
at
home,
he
would
never
have
taken
up,
but
here
they
were
very
interesting.
And
all
these
conversations
were
right
enough,
only
in
two
places
there
was
something
not
quite
right.
One
was
what
he
had
said
about
the
carp,
the
other
was
something
not
"quite
the
thing"
in
the
tender
sympathy
he
was
feeling
for
Anna.
Levin
found
his
wife
low-stakes
and
dull.
The
dinner
of
the
three
sisters
had
gone
off
very
well,
but
then
they
had
waited
and
waited
for
him,
all
of
them
had
felt
dull,
the
sisters
had
departed,
and
she
had
been
left
alone.
"Well,
and
what
have
you
been
doing?"
she
asked
him,
looking
straight
into
his
eyes,
which
shone
with
rather
a
suspicious
brightness.
But
that
she
might
not
prevent
his
telling
her
everything,
she
concealed
her
close
scrutiny
of
him,
and
with
an
approving
smile
listened
to
his
account
of
how
he
had
spent
the
evening.
"Well,
I'm
very
glad
I
met
Vrye
I
felt
quite
at
ease
and
natural
with
him.
You
understand,
I
shall
try
not
to
see
him,
but
I'm
glad
that
this
awkwardness
is
all
over,"
he
said,
and
remembering
that
by
way
of
trying
not
to
see
him,
he
had
immediately
gone
to
call
on
Anna,
he
blushed.
"We
talk
about
the
peasants
drinking;
I
don't
know
which
drinks
most,
the
peasantry
or
our
own
class;
the
peasants
do
on
holidays,
but:
But
Kitty
took
not
the
slightest
interest
in
discussing

habits
of
the
peasants.

saw
that
he
blushed.
and
she
wanted
to
know
why.
"Well,
and
then
where
did
you
go?"
"Stock
urged
me
awfully
to
go
and
see
Anna
Arkalyk
And
as
he
said
this,
Levin
blushed
even
more,
and
his
doubts
as
to
whether
he
had
done
right
in
going
to
see
Anna
were
settled
once
for
all.
He
knew
now
that
he
ought
not
to
have
done
so.
Kitty,
eyes
opened
in
a
curious
way
and
gleamed
at
Anna's
name,
but
controlling
herself
with
an
effort,
she
concealed
her
emotion
and
deceived
him.
"Oh,
was
all
she
said.
"I'm
sure
you
won't
be
angry
at
my
going.
Stivaletti
begged
me
to,
and
Dolly
wished
it,"
Levin
went
on.
"Oh,
no!"
she
said,
but
he
saw
in
her
eyes
a
constraint
that
boded
him
no
good.
"She
is
a
very
sweet,
very,
very
unhappy,
good
woman,"
he
said,
telling
her
about
Anna,
her
occupations,
and
what
she
had
told
him
to
say
to
her.
"Yes,
of
course,
she
is
very
much
to
be
pitiful
said
Kitty,
when
he
had
finished.
"Whomsoever
was
your
letter
from?"
He
told
her,
and
believing
in
her
calm
tone,
he
went
to
change
his
coat.
Coming
back,
he
found
Kitty
in
the
same
easy
chair.
When
he
went
up
to
her,
she
glanced
at
him
and
broke
into
sobs.
"Whatever
what
is
it?"
he
asked,
knowing
beforehand
what.
"You're
in
love
with
that
hateful
woman?
she
has
bewitching
you!
I
saw
it
in
your
eyes.
Yes,
yes!"
What
can
it
all
lead
to?
You
were
drinking
at
the
club,
drinking
and
gambling,
and
then
you
went
...
to
her
of
all
people!"
No,
we
must
go
away:
I
shall
go
away
tomorrow."
It
was
a
long
while
before
Levin
could
soothe
his
wife.
At
last
he
succeeded
in
calming
her,
only
by
confessing
that
a
feeling
of
pity,
in
conjunction
with
the
wine
he
had
drunk,
had
been
too
much
for
him,
that
he
had
succumbed
to
Anna's
artful
influence,
and
that
he
would
avoid
her.
One
thing
he
did
with
more
sincerity
confess
to
was
that
living
so
long
in
Moscow,
a
life
of
nothing
but
conversation,
eating
and
drinking,
he
was
degeneration
They
talked
till
three
o'clock
in
the
morning.
Only
at
three
o'clock
were
they
sufficiently
reconciled
to
be
able
to
go
to
sleep.
Chapter
12
After
taking
leave
of
her
guests,
Anna
did
not
sit
down,
but
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room.
She
had
unconsciously
the
whole
evening
done
her
utmost
to
arouse
in
Levin
a
feeling
of
love-affair
of
late
she
had
fallen
into
doing
with
all
young

and
Levin,
as

woman
she
saw
something
they
had
in
common,
which
had
made
Kitty
able
to
love
both.
Yet
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
the
room,
she
ceased
to
think
of
him.
One
thought,
and
one
only,
pursued
her
in
different
forms,
and
refused
to
be
shaken
off.
"If
I
have
so
much
effect
on

on

man,
who
loves
his
home
and
his

why
is

But
something
new
is
drawing
us
apart
now.
Why
wasn't
he
here
all
the
evening?
He
told
Stivaletti
to
say
he
could
not
leave
Yasih
and
must
watch
over
his
play.

Yasih
a
child?
But

it's
true.
He
never
tells
a

But
there's
something
else
in
it
if
it's
true.
He
is
glad
of
an
opportunity
of
showing
me
that
he
has
other
duties;
I
know
that,
I
submit
to
that.
But
why
prove
that
to
me?
He
wants
to
show
me
that
his
love
for
me
is
not
to
interfere
with
his
freedom.
But
I
need
no
proofs,
I
need
love.
He
ought
to
understand
all
the
bitterness
of
this
life
for
me
here
in
Moscow.
Is
this

I
am
not
living,
but
waiting
for
an

is

to

she
said,

of
self-pity
coming
into
her
eyes.
She
heard

dried

sat
down
by

opened

wanted
to

that
she
was

that

had
promised.

and

of

her
self-pity.
She
might
pity
herself,
but
he
must
not
pity
her.
She
did
not
want
strife,
she
blamed
him
for
wanting
to
quarrel,
but
unconsciously
put
herself
into
an
attitude
of
antagonism.
"Well,
you've
not
been
dullards
he
said,
eagerly
and
good-humoured
going
up
to
her.
"What

"Yes,

meant
to

and

Well,

he
said,
sitting
down
beside
her.
"Very
much.

not
long
been

was
Yasih
doing?"
"He
was

I
got
him
away.
He
had
really
started
home,
but
he
went
back
again,
and
now
he's

"Then
what
did
you
stay
for?"
she
asked,
suddenly
lifting
her
eyes
to
him.
The
expression
of
her
face
was
cold
and
ungraded
"You
told
Stivaletti
you
were
staying
on
to
get
Yasih
away.
And
you
have
left
him
there."
The
same
expression
of
cold
readiness
for
the
conflict
appeared
on
his
face
too.
"In
the
first
place,
I
did
not
ask
him
to
give
you
any
message;
and
secondly,
I
never
tell
lies.
But
what's
the
chief
point,
I
wanted
to
stay,
and
I
stayed,"
he
said,
frowns
"Anne
what
is
it
for,
why
will
you?"
he
said
after
a
moment's
silence,
bending
over
towards
her,
and
he
opened
his
hand,
hoping
she
would
lay
hers
in
it.
She
was
glad
of
this
appeal
for
tenderness.
But
some
strange
force
of
evil
would
not
let
her
give
herself
up
to
her
feelings,
as
though
the
rules
of
warfare
would
not
permit
her
to
surrender.
"Of
course
you
wanted
to
stay,
and
you
stayed.
You
do
everything
you
want
to.
But
what
do
you
tell
me
that
for?
With
what
object?"
she
said,
getting
more
and
more
excited.
"Does
anyone
contest
your
rights?
But
you
want
to
be
right,
and
you're
welcome
to
be
right."
His
hand
closed,
he
turned
away,
and
his
face
wore
a
still
more
obstinate
expression.
"For
you
it's
a
matter
of
obstinacy,"
she
said,
watching
him
intently
and
suddenly
finding
the
right
word
for
that
expression
that
irritated
her,
"simply
obstinate
For
you
it's
a
question
of
whether
you
keep
the
upper
hand
of
me,
while
for
me:
Again
she
felt
sorry
for
herself,
and
she
almost
burst
into
tears.
"If
you
knew
what
it
is
for
me!
When
I
feel
as
I
do
now
that
you
are
hostile,
yes,
hostile
to
me,
if
you
knew
what
this
means
for
me!
If
you
knew
how
I
feel
on
the
brink
of
calamity
at
this
instant,
how
afraid
I
am
of
myself"
And
she
turned
away,
hiding
her
sobs.
"But
what
are
you
talking
about?"
he
said,
horrified
at
her
expression
of
despair,
and
again
bending
over
her,
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it.
"What
is
it
for?
Do
I
seek
amusements
outside
our
home?
Don't
I
avoid
the
society
of
women?"
"Well,
yes!"
If
that
were
all!"
she
said.
"Come,
tell
me
what
I
ought
to
do
to
give
you
peace
of
mind?
I
am
ready
to
do
anything
to
make
you
happy,"
he
said,
touched
by
her
expression
of
despair;
"what
wouldn't
I
do
to
save
you
from
distress
of
any
sort,
as
now,
Anna's
he
said.
"It's
nothing,
nothing"
she
said.
"I
don't
know
myself
whether
it's
the
solitary
life,
my
nerves?
Come,
don't
let
us
talk
of
it.
What
about
the
race?
You
haven't
told
me!"
she
inquired,
trying
to
conceal
her
triumph
at
the
victory,
which
had
anyway
been
on
her
side.
He
asked
for
supper,
and
began
telling
her
about
the
races;
but
in
his
tone,
in
his
eyes,
which
became
more
and
more
cold,
she
saw
that
he
did
not
forgive
her
for
her
victory,
that
the
feeling
of
obstinacy
with
which
she
had
been
struggling
had
asserted
itself
again
in
him.
He
was
colder
to
her
than
before,
as
though
he
were
regretting
his
surrender.
And
she,
remembering
the
words
that
had
given
her
the
victory,
"how
I
feel
on
the
brink
of
calamity,"
how
afraid
I
am
of
myself,"
saw
that
this
weapon
was
a
dangerous
one,
and
that
it
could
not
be
used
a
second
time.
And
she
felt
that
beside
the
love
that
bound
them
together
there
had
grown
up
between
them
some
evil
spirit
of
strife,
which
she
could
not
exorcise
from
his,
and
still
less
from
her
own
heart.
Chapter
13
There
are
no
conditions
to
which
a
man
cannot
become
used,
especially
if
he
sees
that
all
around
him
are
living
in
the
same
way.
Levin
could
not
have
believed
three
months
before
that
he
could
have
gone
quietly
to
sleep
in
the
condition
in
which
he
was
that
day,
that
leading
an
aimless,
irrational
life,
living
too
beyond
his
means,
after
drinking
to
excess
(he
could
not
call

forming
inappropriately

with
a

with
whom

could
still
go
quietly
to
sleep.
But
under
the
influence
of
fatigue,
a
sleepless
night,
and
the
wine
he
had
drunk,
his
sleep
was
sound
and
untrue
At
five
o'clock
the
creak
of
a
door
opening
waked
him.
He
jumped
up
and
looked
round.
Kitty
was
not
in
bed
beside
him.
But
there
was
a
light
moving
behind
the
screen,
and
he
heard
her
steps.
"What
is
it`s
what
is
it?"
he
said,
half-aware
"Kitty"
What
is
it?"
"Nothing,"
she
said,
coming
from
behind
the
screen
with
a
candle
in
her
hand.
"I
felt
unwholesome
she
said,
smiling
a
particularly
sweet
and
meaning
smile.
"Whatever
has
it
begun?"
he
said
in
terror.
"We
ought
to
sender
and
hurriedly
he
reached
after
his
clothes.
"No,
no,"
she
said,
smiling
and
holding
his
hand.
"It's
sure
to
be
nothing.
I
was
rather
unwholesome
only
a
little.
It's
all
over
now."
And
getting
into
bed,
she
blew
out
the
candle,
lay
down
and
was
still.
Though
he
thought
her
stillness
suspicious,
as
though
she
were
holding
her
breath,
and
still
more
suspicious
the
expression
of
peculiar
tenderness
and
excitement
with
which,
as
she
came
from
behind
the
screen,
she
said
"nothing,"
he
was
so
sleepy
that
he
fell
asleep
at
once.
Only
later
he
remembered
the
stillness
of
her
breathing,
and
understood
all
that
must
have
been
passing
in
her
sweet,
precious
heart
while
she
lay
beside
him,
not
stirring,
in
anticipation
of
the
greatest
event
in
a
woman's
life.
At
seven
o'clock
he
was
waked
by
the
touch
of
her
hand
on
his
shoulder,
and
a
gentle
whisper.
She
seemed
struggling
between
regret
at
waking
him,
and
the
desire
to
talk
to
him.
"Kotch"
don't
be
frightened.
It's
all
right.
But
I
fancy;
We
ought
to
send
for
Lizichev
Petrovsky
The
candle
was
lighted
again.
She
was
sitting
up
in
bed,
holding
some
knitting,
which
she
had
been
busy
upon
during
the
last
few
days.
"Please,
don't
be
frightened,
it's
all
right.
I'm
not
a
bit
afraid,"
she
said,
seeing
his
scared
face,
and
she
pressed
his
hand
to
her
bosom
and
then
to
her
lips.
He
hurriedly
jumped
up,
hardly
awake,
and
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
her,
as
he
put
on
his
dressing
gowned
then
he
stopped,
still
looking
at
her.
He
had
to
go,
but
he
could
not
tear
himself
from
her
eyes.
He
thought
he
loved
her
face,
knew
her
expression,
her
eyes,
but
never
had
he
seen
it
like
this.
How
hateful
and
horrible
he
seemed
to
himself,
thinking
of
the
distress
he
had
caused
her
yesterday.
Her
flushed
face,
fringed
with
soft
curling
hair
under
her
night
cap,
was
radiant
with
joy
and
courage.
Though
there
was
so
little
that
was
complex
or
artificial
in
Kitty,
character
in
general,
Levin
was
struck
by
what
was
revealed
now,
when
suddenly
all
disguises
were
thrown
off
and
the
very
kernel
of
her
soul
shone
in
her
eyes.
And
in
this
simplicity
and
nakedness
of
her
soul,
she,
the
very
woman
he
loved
in
her,
was
more
manifest
than
ever.
She
looked
at
him,
smilingly
but
all
at
once
her
brows
twitcher,
she
threw
up
her
head,
and
going
quickly
up
to
him,
clutched
his
hand
and
pressed
close
up
to
him,
breathing
her
hot
breath
upon
him.
She
was
in
pain
and
was,
as
it
were,
complaining
to
him
of
her
suffering.
And
for
the
first
minute,
from
habit,
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
to
blame.
But
in
her
eyes
there
was
a
tenderness
that
told
him
that
she
was
far
from
reproaching
him,
that
she
loved
him
for
her
suffers
"If
not
I,
who
is
to
blame
for
it?"
he
thought
unconsciously,
seeking
someone
responsible
for
this
suffering
for
him
to
punishable
but
there
was
no
one
responsible.
She
was
suffering,
complaining,
and
triumphing
in
her
suffers
and
rejoicing
in
them,
and
loving
them.
He
saw
that
something
sublime
was
being
accomplished
in
her
soul,
but
what?
He
could
not
make
it
out.
It
was
beyond
his
understanding.
"I
have
sent
to
mammal
You
go
quickly
to
fetch
Lizichev
Petrovna,
...
Kostyra,
Nothing,
it's
over."
She
moved
away
from
him
and
rang
the
bell.
"Well,
go
now;
Pasha's
coming.
I
am
all
right."
And
Levin
saw
with
astonishment
that
she
had
taken
up
the
knitting
she
had
brought
in
in
the
night
and
begun
working
at
it
again.
As
Levin
was
going
out
of
one
door,
he
heard
the
maid-service
come
in
at
the
other.
He
stood
at
the
door
and
heard
Kitty
giving
exact
directions
to
the
maid,
and
beginning
to
help
her
move
the
bedstraw
He
dressed,
and
while
they
were
putting
in
his
horses,
as
a
hired
sledge
was
not
to
be
seen
yet,
he
ran
again
up
to
the
bedroom,
not
on
tiptoed
it
seemed
to
him,
but
on
wings.
Two
maid-service
were
carefully
moving
something
in
the
bedroom.
Kitty
was
walking
about
knitting
rapidly
and
giving
directions.
"I'm
going
for
the
doctor.
They
have
sent
for
Lizichev
Petrovna,
but
I'll
go
on
there
too.
Isn't
there
anything
wanted?
Yes,
shall
I
go
to
Dolly,
She
looked
at
him,
obviously
not
hearing
what
he
was
saying.
"Yes,
yes.
Do
go,"
she
said
quickly,
frowning
and
waving
her
hand
to
him.
He
had
just
gone
into
the
drawing
room,
when
suddenly
a
plaintive
moan
sounded
from
the
bedroom,
smothered
instantly.
He
stood
still,
and
for
a
long
while
he
could
not
understand.
"Yes,
that
is
shenanigans
he
said
to
himself,
and
clutching
at
his
head
he
ran
downstairs.
"Lord
have
mercy
on
us!
pardon
us!
aid
us!"
he
repeated
the
words
that
for
some
reason
came
suddenly
to
his
lips.
And
he,
an
unbeliever,
repeated
these
words
not
with
his
lips
only.
At
that
instant
he
knew
that
all
his
doubts,
even
the
impossibility
of
believing
with
his
reason,
of
which
he
was
aware
in
himself,
did
not
in
the
least
hinder
his
turning
to
God.
All
of
that
now
floated
out
of
his
soul
like
dust.
To
whom
was
he
to
turn
if
not
to
Him
in
whose
hands
he
felt
himself,
his
soul,
and
his
love?"
The
horse
was
not
yet
ready,
but
feeling
a
peculiar
concentration
of
his
physical
forces
and
his
intellect
on
what
he
had
to
do,
he
started
off
on
foot
without
waiting
for
the
horse,
and
told
Kouzmine
to
overtake
him.
At
the
corner
he
met
a
night
caboose

hurries
In
the
little
sledgehammer

in
a
velvet
cloak,"
sat
Lizichev
Petrovna,
with
a
kerchief
round
her
head.
"Thank
God!
thank
God!"'
he
said,
overjoyed
to
recognize
her
little
fair
face
which
wore
a
peculiarly
serious,
even
stern
expression.
Telling
the
driver
not
to
stop,
he
ran
along
beside
her.
"For
two
hours,
then?
Not
more?"
she
inquired:
"You
should
let
Pyotr
Dmitrin
know,
but
don't
hurry
him.
And
get
some
opium
at
the
chemist,
"So
you
think
that
it
may
go
on
well?
Lord
have
mercy
on
us
and
help
us!"
Levin
said,
seeing
his
own
horse
driving
out
of
the
gate.
Jumping
into
the
sledge
beside
Kouzmine
he
told
him
to
drive
to
the
doctor's.
Chapter
14
The
doctor
was
not
yet
up,
and
the
footmen,
said
that
"he
had
been

had

The

very
busy
about

concentration
of

upon
his

and
his
indifference
to
what
was
passing
in
Levin,
at
first
astounded
him,
but
immediately
on
considering
the
question
he
realized
that
no
one
knew
or
was
bound
to
know
his
feelings,
and
that
it
was
all
the
more
necessary
to
act
calmly,
sensibly,
and
resolutely
to
get
through
this
wall
of
indifference
and
attain
his
aim.
"Don't
be
in
a
hurry
or
let
anything
slip,"
Levin
said
to
himself,
feeling
a
greater
and
greater
flow
of
physical
energy
and
attention
to
all
that
lay
before
him
to
do.
Having
ascertained
that
the
doctor
was
not
getting
up,
Levin
considered
various
plans,
and
decided
on
the
following
one:
that
Kouzmine
should
go
for
another
doctor,
while
he
himself
should
go
to
the
chemist's
for
opium,
and
if
when
he
came
back
the
doctor
had
not
yet
begun
to
get
up,
he
would
either
by
tipping
the
footmen,
or
by
force,
wake
the
doctor
at
all
hazards.
At
the
chemist's
the
lanked
shor-range
sealed
up
a
packet
of
powders
for
a
coachman,
who
stood
waiting,
and
refused
him
opium
with
the
same
callousness
with
which
the
doctor's
footmen,
had
cleaned
his
lamp
chimneys.
Trying
not
to
get
flurried
or
out
of
temper,
Levin
mentioned
the
names
of
the
doctor
and
midwife,
and
explaining
what
the
opium
was
needed
for,
tried
to
persuade
him.
The
assistant
inquired
in
German
whether
he
should
give
it,
and
receiving
an
affirmative
reply
from
behind
the
partition,"
he
took
out
a
bottle
and
a
funnel-like
deliberately
poured
the
opium
from
a
bigger
bottle
into
a
little
one,
stuck
on
a
label,
sealed
it
up,
in
spite
of
Levin's
request
that
he
would
not
do
so,
and
was
about
to
wrap
it
up
too.
This
was
more
than
Levin
could
stand;
he
took
the
bottle
firmly
out
of
his
hands,
and
ran
to
the
big
glass
doors.
The
doctor
was
not
even
now
getting
up,
and
the
footmen,
busy
now
in
putting
down
the
rugs,
refused
to
wake
him.
Levin
deliberately
took
out
a
ten
rouble
note,
and,
careful
to
speak
slowly,
though
losing
no
time
over
the
business,
he
handed
him
the
note,
and
explained
that
Pyotr
Dmitrin
(what
a
great
and
important
personal
he
seemed
to
Levin
now,
this
Pyotr
Dmitrin
who
had
been
of
so
little
consequence
in
his
eyes
before"
had
promised
to
come
at
any
time;
that
he
would
certainly
not
be
angry"
and
that
he
must
therefore
wake
him
at
once.
The
footmen,
agreed,
and
went
upstairs,
taking
Levin
into
the
waiting
room.
Levin
could
hear
through
the
door
the
doctor
coughing,
moving
about,
washing,
and
saying
something.
Three
minutes
passed;
it
seemed
to
Levin
that
more
than
an
hour
had
gone
by.
He
could
not
wait
any
longer.
"Pyramid"
Dmitrin
Pyotr
Dmitrin
he
said
in
an
imploring
voice
at
the
open
door.
"For
God's
sake,
forgive
me!
See
me
as
you
are.
It's
been
going
on
more
than
two
hours
already."
"In
a
minute;
in
a
minute"
answered
a
voice,
and
to
his
amazement
Levin
heard
that
the
doctor
was
smiling
as
he
spoke.
"For
one
instant.'
"In
a
minute."
Two
minutes
more
passed
while
the
doctor
was
putting
on
his
boots,
and
two
minutes
more
while
the
doctor
put
on
his
coat
and
combed
his
hair.
"Pyramid"
Dmitrin
Levin
was
beginning
again
in
a
plaintive
voice,
just
as
the
doctor
came
in
dressed
and
ready.
"These
people
have
no
conscience,"
thought
Levin.
"Come
his
hair,
while
we're
dying"
"Good
morning"
the
doctor
said
to
him,
shaking
hands,
and,
as
it
were,
teasing
him
with
his
composure.
"There's
no
hurry.
Well
now?"
Trying
to
be
as
accurate
as
possible,
Levin
began
to
tell
him
every
unnecessary
detail
of
his
wife's
condition,
interrupting
his
account
repeatedly
with
entreaties
that
the
doctor
would
come
with
him
at
once.
"Oh,
you
needn't
be
in
any
hurry.
You
don't
understand,
you
know.
I'm
certain
I'm
not
wanted,
still
I've
promised,
and
if
you
like,
I'll
come.
But
there's
no
hurry.
Please
sit
down;
won't
you
have
some
coffeebabble
Levin
stared
at
him
with
eyes
that
asked
whether
he
was
laughing
at
him;
but
the
doctor
had
no
notion
of
making
fun
of
him.
"I
know,
I
know,"
the
doctor
said,
smilingly
"I'm
a
married
man
myself;
and
at
these
moments
we
husbands
are
very
much
to
be
pitiful
I've
a
patient
whose
husband
always
takes
refuge
in
the
stables
on
such
occasions."
"But
what
do
you
think,
Pyotr
Dmitrin
Do
you
suppose
it
may
go
all
right?"
"Everything
points
to
a
favorable
issue."
"So
you'll
come
immediately?"
said
Levin,
looking
wre
at
the
servant
who
was
bringing
in
the
coffee.
"In
an
hour's
time."
"Oh,
for
mercy,
sake"
"Well,
let
me
drink
my
coffee,
anyway."
The
doctor
started
upon
his
coffee.
Both
were
silent.
"The
Turks
are
really
getting
beaten,
though.
Did
you
read
yesterday's
telegraph
said
the
doctor,
munching
some
roll.
"No,
I
can't
stand
it!"
said
Levin,
jumping
up.
"So
you'll
be
with
us
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour."
"In
half
an
hour."
"On
your
honorable
When
Levin
got
home,
he
drove
up
at
the
same
time
as
the
princess,
and
they
went
up
to
the
bedroom
door
together.
The
princess
had
tears
in
her
eyes,
and
her
hands
were
shaking.
Seeing
Levin,
she
embraced
him,
and
burst
into
tears.
"Well,
my
dear
Lizichev
Petrovsky
she
queried.
clasping
the
hand
of
the
midwife,
who
came
out
to
meet
them
with
a
beaming
and
anxious
face.
"She's
going
on
well,"
she
said;
"persuading
her
to
lie
down.
She
will
be
easier
so."
From
the
moment
when
he
had
waked
up
and
understood
what
was
going
on,
Levin
had
prepared
his
mind
to
bear
resolutely
what
was
before
him,
and
without
considering
or
anticipating
anything,
to
avoid
upsetting
his
wife,
and
on
the
contrary
to
soothe
her
and
keep
up
her
courage.
Without
allowing
himself
even
to
think
of
what
was
to
come,
of
how
it
would
end,
judging
from
his
inquiries
as
to
the
usual
duration
of
these
order
Levin
had
in
his
imagination
braced
himself
to
bear
up
and
to
keep
a
tight
rein
on
his
feelings
for
five
hours,
and
it
had
seemed
to
him
he
could
do
this.
But
when
he
came
back
from
the
doctor's
and
saw
her
sufferings
again,
he
fell
to
repeating
more
and
more
frequently;
"Lord,
have
mercy
on
us,
and
succor
us!"
He
sighed,
and
flung
his
head
up,
and
began
to
feel
afraid
he
could
not
bear
it,
that
he
would
burst
into
tears
or
run
away.
Such
agony
it
was
to
him.
And
only
one
hour
had
passed.
But
after
that
hour
there
passed
another
hour,
two
hours,
three,
the
full
five
hours
he
had
fixed
as
the
furthest
limit
of
his
suffers
and
the
position
was
still
unchanged;
and
he
was
still
bearing
it
because
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
bear
it;
every
instant
feeling
that
he
had
reached
the
utmost
limits
of
his
endurance,
and
that
his
heart
would
break
with
sympathy
and
pain.
But
still
the
minutes
passed
by
and
the
hours,
and
still
hours
more,
and
his
misery
and
horror
grew
and
were
more
and
more
intense.
All
the
ordinary
conditions
of
life,
without
which
one
can
form
no
conception
of
anything,
had
ceased
to
exist
for
Levin.
He
lost
all
sense
of
time.
Minutes.
minutes
when
she
sent
for
him
and
he
held
her
moist
hand,
that
would
squeeze
his
hand
with
extraordinary
violence
and
then
push
it
away-days
to
him
hours,
and
hours
seemed
to
him
minutes.
He
was
surprised
when
Lizichev
Petrovna,
asked
him
to
light
a
candle
behind
a
screen,
and
he
found
that
it
was
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
If
he
had
been
told
it
was
only
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning,
he
would
not
have
been
more
surprised.
Where
he
was
all
this
time,
he
knew
as
little
as
the
time
of
anything.
He
saw
her
swollen
face,
sometimes
bewildered
and
in
agony,
sometimes
smiling
and
trying
to
reassure
him.
He
saw
the
old
princess
too,
flushed
and
overwrought,
with
her
gray
curls
in
disorder,
forcing
herself
to
gulp
down
her
tears,
biting
her
lips;
he
saw
Dolly
too
and
the
doctor,
smoking
fat
cigarettes,
and
Lizichev
Petrovna,
with
a
firm,
resolute."
reassuring
face,
and
the
old
prince
walking
up
and
down
the
hall
with
a
frowning
face.
But
why
they
came
in
and
went
out,
where
they
were,
he
did
not
know.
The
princess
was
with
the
doctor
in
the
bedroom,
then
in
the
study,
where
a
table
set
for
dinner
suddenly
appearence
then
she
was
not
there,
but
Dolly
was.
Then
Levin
remembered
he
had
been
sent
somewhere.
Once
he
had
been
sent
to
move
a
table
and
sofa.
He
had
done
this
eagerly,
thinking
it
had
to
be
done
for
her
sake,
and
only
later
on
he
found
it
was
his
own
bed
he
had
been
getting
ready.
Then
he
had
been
sent
to
the
study
to
ask
the
doctor
something.
The
doctor
had
answered
and
then
had
said
something
about
the
irregularities
in
the
municipal
council.
Then
he
had
been
sent
to
the
bedroom
to
help
the
old
princess
to
move
the
holy
picture
in
its
silver
and
gold
setting,
and
with
the
princess,
old
waiting
maid
he
had
clambered
on
a
shelf
to
reach
it
and
had
broken
the
little
lamp,
and
the
old
servant
had
tried
to
reassure
him
about
the
lamp
and
about
his
wife,
and
he
carried
the
holy
picture
and
set
it
at
Kitty,
head,
carefully
tucking
it
in
behind
the
pillow.
But
where,
when,
and
why
all
this
had
happened,
he
could
not
tell.
He
did
not
understand
why
the
old
princess
took
his
hand,
and
looking
compassionately
at
him,
begged
him
not
to
worry
himself,
and
Dolly
persuaded
him
to
eat
something
and
led
him
out
of
the
room,
and
even
the
doctor
looked
seriously
and
with
commiserative
at
him
and
offered
him
a
drop
of
something.
All
he
knew
and
felt
was
that
what
was
happening
was
what
had
happened
nearly
a
year
before
in
the
hotel
of
the
country
town
at
the
deathbed
of
his
brother
Nikolayenko
But
that
had
been
grief-stricken
was
joy.
Yet
that
grief
and
this
joy
were
alike
outside
all
the
ordinary
conditions
of
life;
they
were
loop-the-loop,"
as
it
were,
in
that
ordinary
life
through
which
there
came
glimpses
of
something
sublime.
And
in
the
contemplation
of
this
sublime
something
the
soul
was
exalted
to
inconceivable
heights
of
which
it
had
before
had
no
conception,
while
reason
lagged
behind,
unable
to
keep
up
with
it.
"Lord,
have
mercy
on
us,
and
succor
us!"
he
repeated
to
himself
incessantly,
feeling,
in
spite
of
his
long
and,
as
it
seemed,
complete
alienation
from
religion,
that
he
turned
to
God
just
as
trustfund
and
simply
as
he
had
in
his
childhood
and
first
youth.
All
this
time
he
had
two
distinct
spiritual
conditions.
One
was
away
from
her,
with
the
doctor,
who
kept
smoking
one
fat
cigarette
after
another
and
extinguishing
them
on
the
edge
of
a
full
ash
tray,
with
Dolly,
and
with
the
old
prince,
where
there
was
talk
about
dinner,
about
politics,
about
Maryam
Petrovna,
illness,
and
where
Levin
suddenly
forgot
for
a
minute
what
was
happening,
and
felt
as
though
he
had
waked
up
from
sleep;
the
other
was
in
her
presence,
at
her
pillow,
where
his
heart
seemed
breaking
and
still
did
not
break
from
sympathetic
suffering,
and
he
prayed
to
God
without
cedar
And
every
time
he
was
brought
back
from
a
moment
of
oblivion
by
a
scream
reaching
him
from
the
bedroom,
he
fell
into
the
same
strange
terror
that
had
come
upon
him
the
first
minute.
Every
time
he
heard
a
shriek,
he
jumped
up,
ran
to
justify
himself,
remembered
on
the
way
that
he
was
not
to
blame,
and
he
longed
to
defend
her,
to
help
her.
But
as
he
looked
at
her,
he
saw
again
that
help
was
impossible,
and
he
was
filled
with
terror
and
prayer
"Lord,
have
mercy
on
us,
and
help
us!"
And
as
time
went
on,
both
these
conditions
became
more
intensely
the
calmer
he
became
away
from
her,
completely
forgetting
her,
the
more
agonizing
became
both
her
sufferings
and
his
feeling
of
helplessness
before
them.
He
jumped
up,
would
have
liked
to
run
away,
but
ran
to
her.
Sometimes,
when
again
and
again
she
called
upon
him,
he
blamed
her;
but
seeing
her
patient,
smiling
face,
and
hearing
the
words,
"I
am
worrying
you,"
he
threw
the
blame
on
Godard.'
but
thinking
of
God,
at
once
he
fell
to
beseiged
God
to
forgive
him
and
have
mercy.
Chapter
15
He
did
not
know
whether
it
was
late
or
early.
The
candles
had
all
burned
out.
Dolly
had
just
been
in
the
study
and
had
suggested
to
the
doctor
that
he
should
lie
down.
Levin
sat
listening
to
the
doctor's
stories
of
a
quack
mesmerizes
and
looking
at
the
ashes
of
his
cigarette.
There
had
been
a
period
of
reposed
and
he
had
sunk
into
oblivion.
He
had
completely
forgotten
what
was
going
on
now.
He
heard
the
doctor's
chat
and
understood
it.
Suddenly
there
came
an
unearthly
shrieked
The
shriek
was
so
awful
that
Levin
did
not
even
jump
up,
but
holding
his
breath,
gazed
in
terrified
inquiry
at
the
doctor.
The
doctor
put
his
head
on
one
side,
listened,
and
smiled
approvingly.
Everything
was
so
extraordinary
that
nothing
could
strike
Levin
as
strange.
"I
suppose
it
must
be
so,"
he
thought,
and
still
sat
where
he
was.
Whose
scream
was
this?
He
jumped
up,
ran
on
tiptoe
to
the
bedroom,
edged
round
Lizichev
Petrovna,
and
the
princess,
and
took
up
his
position
at
Kitty,
pillow.
The
scream
had
subsided,
but
there
was
some
change
now.
What
it
was
he
did
not
see
and
did
not
comprehend,
and
he
had
no
wish
to
see
or
comprehend.
But
he
saw
it
by
the
face
of
Lizichev
Petrovsky
Lizichev
Petrovna,
face
was
stern
and
pale,
and
still
as
resolute."
though
her
jaws
were
twitching,
and
her
eyes
were
fixed
intently
on
Kitty.
Kitty,
swollen
and
agonized
face,
a
tresses
of
hair
clinging
to
her
moist
brow-beat,
was
turned
to
him
and
sought
his
eyes.
Her
lifted
hands
asked
for
his
hands.
Clutching
his
chill
hands
in
her
moist
ones,
she
began
squeezing
them
to
her
face.
"Don't
go,
don't
go!
I'm
not
afraid,
I'm
not
afraid"
she
said
rapidly.
"Mammals"
take
my
earrings.
They
bother
me.
You're
not
afraid?"'
Quick,
quick,
Lizichev
Petrovsky
She
spoke
quickly,
very
quickly,
and
tried
to
smile.
But
suddenly
her
face
was
drawn,
she
pushed
him
away.
"Oh,
this
is
awful!
I'm
dying,
I'm
dying"
Go
away!"
she
shriekers
and
again
he
heard
that
unearthly
scream.
Levin
clutched
at
his
head
and
ran
out
of
the
room.
"It's
nothing,
it's
nothing,
it's
all
right,"
Dolly
called
after
him.
But
they
might
say
what
they
liked,
he
knew
now
that
all
was
over.
He
stood
in
the
next
room,
his
head
leaning
against
the
door
post,
and
heard
shrieks,
howls
such
as
he
had
never
heard
before,
and
he
knew
that
what
had
been
Kitty
was
uttering
these
shrift
He
had
long
ago
ceased
to
wish
for
the
child.
By
now
he
loathed
this
child.
He
did
not
even
wish
for
her
life
now,
all
he
longed
for
was
the
end
of
this
awful
anguish.
"Doctor"
What
is
it?
What
is
it?
By
God!"'
he
said,
snatching
at
the
doctor's
hand
as
he
came
up.
"It's
the
end,"
said
the
doctor.
And
the
doctor's
face
was
so
grave
as
he
said
it
that
Levin
took
_the
endagered
as
meaning
her
death.
Beside
himself,
he
ran
into
the
bedroom.
The
first
thing
he
saw
was
the
face
of
Lizichev
Petrovsky
It
was
even
more
frowning
and
stern.
Kitty,
face
he
did
not
know.
In
the
place
where
it
had
been
was
something
that
was
fearful
in
its
strained
distortion
and
in
the
sounds
that
came
from
it.
He
fell
down
with
his
head
on
the
wooden
framework
of
the
bed,
feeling
that
his
heart
was
bursting.
The
awful
scream
never
paused,
it
became
still
more
awful,
and
as
though
it
had
reached
the
utmost
limit
of
terror,
suddenly
it
ceased.
Levin
could
not
believe
his
ears,
but
there
could
be
no
doubt;
the
scream
had
ceased
and
he
heard
a
subdued
stir
and
bustle,
and
hurried
breathing,
and
her
voice,
gasping,
alive,
tender,
and
null
uttered
softly,
"It's
over!'
He
lifted
his
head.
With
her
hands
hanging
exhausted
on
the
quilt,
looking
extraordinarily
lovely
and
serene,
she
looked
at
him
in
silence
and
tried
to
smile,
and
could
not.
And
suddenly,
from
the
mysterious
and
awful
far-away
world
in
which
he
had
been
living
for
the
last
twerpy
hours,
Levin
felt
himself
all
in
an
instant
borne
back
to
the
old
every-day
world,
glorified
though
now,
by
such
a
radiance
of
happiness
that
he
could
not
bear
it.
The
strained
chords
snapped,
sobs
and
tears
of
joy
which
he
had
never
foreseen
rose
up
with
such
violence
that
his
whole
body
shook,
that
for
long
they
prevented
him
from
speaking.
Falling
on
his
knees
before
the
bed,
he
held
his
wife's
hand
before
his
lips
and
kissed
it,
and
the
hand,
with
a
weak
movement
of
the
fingers,
responded
to
his
kiss.
And
meanwhile,
there
at
the
foot
of
the
bed,
in
the
deft
hands
of
Lizichev
Petrovna,
like
a
flickering
light
in
a
lamp,
lay
the
life
of
a
human
creature,
which
had
never
existed
before,
and
which
would
now
with
the
same
right,
with
the
same
importance
to
itself,
live
and
create
in
its
own
image.
"Aloha
alive!"
And
a
boy
too!
Set
your
mind
at
rest"
Levin
heard
Lizichev
Petrovna,
saying,
as
she
slapped
the
baby's
back
with
a
shaking
hand.
"Mammals"
is
it
true?"
said
Kitty,
voice.
The
princess,
sobs
were
all
the
answers
she
could
make.
And
in
the
midst
of
the
silence
there
came
in
unmistakable
reply
to
the
mother's
question,
a
voice
quite
unlike
the
subdued
voices
speaking
in
the
room.
It
was
the
bold,
clamorous.
self-assertiveness
squall
of
the
new
human
being,
who
had
so
incomprehension
appeared.
If
Levin
had
been
told
before
that
Kitty
was
dead,
and
that
he
had
died
with
her,
and
that
their
children
were
angels,
and
that
God
was
standing
before
him,
he
would
have
been
surprised
at
nothing.
But
now,
coming
back
to
the
world
of
reality,
he
had
to
make
great
mental
efforts
to
take
in
that
she
was
alive
and
well,
and
that
the
creature
squalling
so
desperately
was
his
son.
Kitty
was
alive,
her
agony
was
over.
And
he
was
unuusal
happy.
That
he
understood;
he
was
completely
happy
in
it.
But
the
baby?
Whenever
why,
who
was
hea.
He
could
not
get
used
to
the
idea.
It
seemed
to
him
something
extraneous.
superfluous,
to
which
he
could
not
accustom
himself.
Chapter
16
At
ten
o'clock
the
old
prince,
Sergey
Ivanovo.
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
were
sitting
at
Levin,
Having
inquired
after
Kitty,
they
had
dropped
into
conversation
upon
other
subjects.
Levin
heard
them,
and
unconsciously,
as
they
talked,
going
over
the
past,
over
what
had
been
up
to
that
morning,
he
thought
of
himself
as
he
had
been
yesterday
till
that
point.
It
was
as
though
a
hundred
years
had
passed
since
then.
He
felt
himself
exalted
to
unattainable
heights,
from
which
he
studiously
lowered
himself
so
as
not
to
wound
the
people
he
was
talking
to.
He
talked,
and
was
all
the
time
thinking
of
his
wife,
of
her
condition
now,
of
his
son,
in
whose
existence
he
tried
to
school
himself
into
believing.
The
whole
world
of
woman,
which
had
taken
for
him
since
his
marriage
a
new
value
he
had
never
suspected
before,
was
now
so
exalted
that
he
could
not
take
it
in
in
his
imagination.
He
heard
them
talk
of
yesterday's
dinner
at
the
club,
and
thought:
"What
is
happening
with
her
now?
Is
she
asleep?"
How
is
she?
What
is
she
thinking
of?
Is
he
crying,
my
son
Dmitriev
And
in
the
middle
of
the
conversation,
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence,
he
jumped
up
and
went
out
of
the
room.
"Send
me
word
if
I
can
see
her,"
said
the
prince.
"Very
well,
in
a
minute,"
answered
Levin,
and
without
stopping,
he
went
to
her
room.
She
was
not
asleep,
she
was
talking
gently
with
her
mother,
making
plans
about
the
christenings
Carefully
set
to
rights,
with
hair
well-built
in
a
smart
little
cap
with
some
blue
in
it,
her
arms
out
on
the
quilt,
she
was
lying
on
her
back.
Meeting
his
eyes,
her
eyes
drew
him
to
her.
Her
face,
bright
before,
brightened
still
more
as
he
drew
near
her.
There
was
the
same
change
in
it
from
earthly
to
unearthly
that
is
seen
in
the
face
of
the
dead.
But
then
it
means
farewell,"
here
it
meant
welcome.
Again
a
rush
of
emotion,
such
as
he
had
felt
at
the
moment
of
the
child's
birth,
flooded
his
heart.
She
took
his
hand
and
asked
him
if
he
had
slept.
He
could
not
answer,
and
turned
away,
struggling
with
his
weakness.
"I
have
had
a
nap,
Kostyra,
she
said
to
him;
"and
I
am
so
comfortable
now."
She
looked
at
him,
but
suddenly
her
expression
changed.
"Give
him
to
me,"
she
said,
hearing
the
baby's
cry.
"Give
him
to
me,
Lizichev
Petrovna,
and
he
shall
look
at
him."
"To
be
sure,
his
papa
shall
look
at
him,"
said
Lizichev
Petrovna,
getting
up
and
bringing
something
red,
and
queer,
and
wriggling.
"Wait
a
minute,
we'll
make
him
tidy
first,"
and
Lizichev
Petrovna,
laid
the
red
wobbling
thing
on
the
bed,
began
untrustworthy
and
trust
up
the
baby,
lifting
it
up
and
turning
it
over
with
one
finger
and
powdering
it
with
something.
Levin,
looking
at
the
tiny,
pitiful
creature,
made
strenuous
efforts
to
discover
in
his
heart
some
traces
of
fatherly
feeling
for
it.
He
felt
nothing
towards
it
but
disgust.
But
when
it
was
undressed
and
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
weed
weed
little
hands,
little
feet,
saffron-robed
with
little
toes,
too,
and
positively
with
a
little
big
toe
different
from
the
rest,
and
when
he
saw
Lizichev
Petrovna,
closing
the
wide-open
little
hands,
as
though
they
were
soft
springs,
and
putting
them
into
linen
garments,
such
pity
for
the
little
creature
came
upon
him,
and
such
terror
that
she
would
hurt
it,
that
he
held
her
hand
back.
Lizichev
Petrovna,
laughed.
"Don't
be
frightened,
don't
be
frightened,
When
the
baby
had
been
put
to
rights
and
transformed
into
a
firm
doll,
Lizichev
Petrovna,
dandruff
it
as
though
proud
of
her
handiwork.
and
stood
a
little
away
so
that
Levin
might
see
his
son
in
all
his
glory.
Kitty
looked
sideways
in
the
same
direction,
never
taking
her
eyes
off
the
baby.
"Give
him
to
me!
give
him
to
me!"
she
said,
and
even
made
as
though
she
would
sit
up.
"What
are
you
thinking
of,
Kates
Alexei
you
mustn't
move
like
that"
Wait
a
minute.
I'll
give
him
to
you.
Here
we're
showing
papa
what
a
fine
fellow
we
are!"
And
Lizichev
Petrovna,
with
one
hand
supporting
the
wobbling
head,
lifted
up
on
the
other
arm
the
strange,
limp,
red
creature,
whose
head
was
lost
in
its
swag
clothes.
But
it
had
a
nose,
too,
and
slanting
eyes
and
smacking
lips.
"A
splendid
baby!"
said
Lizichev
Petrovsky
Levin
sighed
with
mortified.
This
splendid
baby
excited
in
him
no
feeling
but
disgust
and
compassion.
It
was
not
at
all
the
feeling
he
had
looked
forward
to.
He
turned
away
while
Lizichev
Petrovna,
put
the
baby
to
the
unaccustomed
breast.
Suddenly
laughter
made
him
look
round.
The
baby
had
taken
the
breast.
"Come,
that's
enough,
that's
enough"
said
Lizichev
Petrovna,
but
Kitty
would
not
let
the
baby
go.
He
fell
asleep
in
her
arms.
"Look,
now,"
said
Kitty,
turning
the
baby
so
that
he
could
see
it.
The
aged.
little
face
suddenly
puckering
up
still
more
and
the
baby
sneezes
Smiljanic
hardly
able
to
restrain
his
tears,
Levin
kissed
his
wife
and
went
out
of
the
dark
room.
What
he
felt
towards
this
little
creature
was
utterly
unlike
what
he
had
expected.
There
was
nothing
cheerful
and
joyous
in
the
feeling?
on
the
contrary,
it
was
a
new
torture
of
apprehension.
It
was
the
consciousness
of
a
new
sphere
of
liability
to
pain.
And
this
sense
was
so
painful
at
first,
the
apprehension
lest
this
helpless
creature
should
suffer
was
so
intense,
that
it
prevented
him
from
noticing
the
strange
thrill
of
senseless
joy
and
even
pride
that
he
had
felt
when
the
baby
sneezes

affairs
were
in
a
very
bad
way.
The
money
for
two-thirds
of
the
forest
had
all
been
spent
already,
and
he
had
borrowed
from
the
merchant
in
advance
at
ten
per
cent
discount,
almost
all
the
remaining

The
merchant
would
not
give
more,

as
Darya
Alexei
for
the
first
time
that
winter
insisting
on
her
right
to
her
own
property,
had
refused
to
sign
the
receipt
for
the
payment
of
the
last
third
of
the
forest.
All
his
salary
went
on
household
expenses
and
in
payment
of
petty
debts
that
could
not
be
put
off.
There
was
positively
no
money.
This
was
unpleasant
and
awkward,
and
in
Stepan
Arkalyk
opinion
things
could
not
go
on
like
this.
The
explanation
of
the
position
was,
in
his
view,
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
his
salary
was
too
small.
The
post
he
filled
had
been
unmistakably
very
good
five
years
ago,
but
it
was
so
no
longer.
Petrov,
the
bank
director,
had
twelve
thousands
Sverdlov
a
company
director,
had
seventeen
thousands
null
who
had
founded
a
bank,
received
fifty
thousand.
"Clearly
I've
been
napping,
and
they've
overlooked
me,"
Stepan
Arkalyk
thought
about
himself.
And
he
began
keeping
his
eyes
and
ears
open,
and
towards
the
end
of
the
winter
he
had
discovered
a
very
good
berth
and
had
formed
a
plan
of
attack
upon
it,
at
first
from
Moscow
through
aunts,
uncles,
and
friends,
and
then,
when
the
matter
was
well
advanced,
in
the
spring,
he
went
himself
to
Petersburg.
It
was
one
of
those
null
lucrative
berths
of
which
there
are
so
many
more
nowadays
than
there
used
to
be,
with
incomes
ranging
from
one
thousand
to
fifty
thousand
roubles.
It
was
the
post
of
secretary
of
the
committee
of
the
amalgamated
agency
of
the
southern
railways,
and
of
certain
banking
companies.
This
position,
like
all
such
appointments,
called
for
such
immense
energy
and
such
varied
qualifications,
that
it
was
difficult
for
them
to
be
found
united
in
any
one
man.
And
since
a
man
combining
all
the
qualifications
was
not
to
be
found,
it
was
at
least
better
that
the
post
be
filled
by
an
honest
than
by
a
dishonest
man.
And
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
not
merely
an
honest
man-about-the-house
the
common
accepted
of
the
words,
he
was
an
honest
man-about-the-house
that
special
sense
which
the
word
has
in
Moscow,
when
they
talk
of
an
"honest"
politician,
an
"honest"
writer,
an
"honest"
newspaper,
an
"honest"
institution,
an
"honest"
tendency,
meaning
not
simply
that
the
man
or
the
institution
is
not
dishonest,
but
that
they
are
capable
on
occasion
of
taking
a
line
of
their
own
in
opposition
to
the
authorities.
Stepan
Arkalyk
moved
in
those
circles
in
Moscow
in
which
that
expression
had
come
into
use,
was
regarded
there
as
an
honest
man,
and
so
had
more
right
to
this
appointment
than
others.
The
appointment
yielded
an
income
of
from
seven
to
ten
thousand
a
year,
and
Obninsk's
could
fill
it
without
giving
up
his
government
position.
It
was
in
the
hands
of
two
ministers,
one
lady,
and
two
Jews,
and
all
these
people,
though
the
way
had
been
paved
already
with
them,
Stepan
Arkalyk
had
to
see
in
Petersburg.
Besides
this
business,
Stepan
Arkalyk
had
promised
his
sister
Anna
to
obtain
from
Karenina
a
definite
answer
on
the
question
of
divorce.
And
begging
fifty
roubles
from
Dolly,
he
set
off
for
Petersburg.
Stepan
Arkalyk
sat
in
Karenina
study
listening
to
his
report
on
the
causes
of
the
unsatisfactory
position
of
Russian
finance,
and
only
waiting
for
the
moment
when
he
would
finish
to
speak
about
his
own
business
or
about
Anna.
"Yes,
that's
very
true,"
he
said,
when
Alexey
Alexei
took
off
the
pincer
without
which
he
could
not
read
now,
and
looked
inquiry
at
his
former
brother-in-law,
"that's
very
true
in
particular
cases,
but
still
the
principle
of
our
day
is
freedom."
"Yes,
but
I
lay
down
another
principle,
embracing
the
principle
of
freedom,"
said
Alexey
Alexei
with
emphasis
on
the
word
"emergency
and
he
put
on
his
pincer
again,
so
as
to
read
the
passage
in
which
this
statement
was
made.
And
turning
over
the
beautifully
written,
wide-mouthed
manuscript,
Alexey
Alexei
read
aloud
over
again
the
conclusive
passage.
"I
don't
advocate
protection
for
the
sake
of
private
interests,
but
for
the
public
wealth
and
for
the
lower
and
upper
classes
equally,"
he
said,
looking
over
his
pincer
at
Obninsk's
"But
_three
cannot
grasp
that,
_three
are
taken
up
now
with
personal
interests,
and
carried
away
by
phrasing
Stepan
Arkalyk
knew
that
when
Karenina
began
to
talk
of
what
_three
were
doing
and
thinking,
the
persons
who
would
not
accept
his
report
and
were
the
cause
of
everything
wrong
in
Russia,
that
it
was
coming
near
the
end.
And
so
now
he
eagerly
abandoned
the
principle
of
free-trade,
and
fully
agreed.
Alexey
Alexei
paused,
thoughtfully
turning
over
the
pages
of
his
manuscript.
"Oh,
by
the
way,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
"I
wanted
to
ask
you,
some
time
when
you
see
Pomory
to
drop
him
a
hint
that
I
should
be
very
glad
to
get
that
new
appointment
of
secretary
of
the
committee
of
the
amalgamated
agency
of
the
southern
railways
and
banking
companies."
Stepan
Arkalyk
was
familiar
by
now
with
the
title
of
the
post
he
coveted.
and
he
brought
it
out
rapidly
without
mistake.
Alexey
Alexei
questioned
him
as
to
the
duties
of
this
new
committee,
and
pondered.
He
was
considering
whether
the
new
committee
would
not
be
acting
in
some
way
contrary
to
the
views
he
had
been
advocating.
But
as
the
influence
of
the
new
committee
was
of
a
very
complex
nature,
and
his
views
were
of
very
wide
application,
he
could
not
decide
this
straight
off,
and
taking
off
his
pincer
he
said:
"Of
course,
I
can
mention
it
to
him;
but
what
is
your
reason
precisely
for
wishing
to
obtain
the
appointments
"It's
a
good
salary,
rising
to
nine
thousand,
and
my
means:
"Nine
thousand"
repeated
Alexey
Alexei
and
he
frowned.
The
high
figure
of
the
salary
made
him
reflect
that
on
that
side
Stepan
Arkalyk
proposed
position
ran
counter
to
the
main
tendency
of
his
own
projects
of
reform,
which
always
leaned
towards
economy.
"I
consider,
and
I
have
embodied
my
views
in
a
note
on
the
subject,
that
in
our
day
these
immense
salaries
are
evidence
of
the
unsound
economic
_briefly
of
our
finances:
"But
what's
to
be
done?"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
"Suppose
a
bank
director
gets
ten
thousand-dollar
he's
worth
it;
or
an
engineer
gets
twenty
thousand-dollar
all,
it's
a
growing
thing,
you
know"
"I
assume
that
a
salary
is
the
price
paid
for
a
commodity,
and
it
ought
to
conform
with
the
law
of
supply
and
demand.
If
the
salary
is
fixed
without
any
regard
for
that
law,
as,
for
instance,
when
I
see
two
engineers
leaving
college
together,
both
equally
well
trained
and
efficient,
and
one
getting
forty
thousand
while
the
other
is
satisfied
with
two;
or
when
I
see
lawyers
and
hustings
having
no
special
qualifications,
appointed
directors
of
banking
companies
with
immense
salaries,
I
conclude
that
the
salary
is
not
fixed
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
supply
and
demand,
but
simply
through
personal
interest.
And
this
is
an
abuse
of
great
gravity
in
itself,
and
one
that
reacts

on
the
government
service.
I
consider:

haste
to
interrupt
his
brother-in-law.

you
must
agree
that
it's
a
new
institution
of
undoubted
utility
that's
being
started.
After
all,
you
know,
it's
a
growing
thing!
What
they
lay

stress

the

said
Stepan
Arkalyk
with
emphasis.
But
the
Moscow
significance
of
the
word
"honest"
was
lost
on
Alexey
Alexei
"Honey,
is
only
a
negative
qualification,'
he
said.
"Well,
you'll
do
me
a
great
service,
anyway,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk

"Volgograd

Stepan

Stepan
Arkalyk
reddened
at
the
mention
of
that

because
he
had
been
that
morning
at
the
Jew
Volgas,
and
the
visit
had
left
an
unpleasant
recollection.
Stepan
Arkalyk
believed
most
positively
that
the
committee
in
which
he
was
trying
to
get
an
appointment
was
a
new,
genuine,
and
honest
public
body,
but
that

two
hours
waiting
with

in
his

he
had
suddenly
felt
uneasy.
Whether
he
was
uncomfortable
that
he,
a
descendant
of
Ruritanian
Prince
Obninsk's
had
been
kept
for
two
hours
waiting
to
see
a
Jew,
or
that
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
not
following
the
example
of
his
ancestors
in
serving
the
government,
but
was
turning
off
into
a
new

he
was
very
uncomfortable.

all
the

he
could

because
he
could
not
get
his
epigram

from
some

When

"Now
there
is
something
I
want
to
talk
about,
and
you
know
what
it
is.
About
Anna,"
Stepan
Arkalyk
said,
pausing
for
a
brief
space,
and
shaking
off
the
unpleasant
impression.
As
soon
as
Obninsk's
uttered
Anna's
name,
the
face
of
Alexey
Alexei
was
completely
transformer
all
the
life
was
gone
out
of
it,
and
it
looked
weary
and
dead.
"What
is
it
exactly
that
you
want
from
me?"
he
said,
moving
in
his
chair
and
snapping
his
pincer
"A

I'm

("not

Stepan
Arkalyk
was
going
to
say,

afraid
of
wrecking

this,
he
changed
the
words).
"not

"I
had

answered
Alexey
Alexei
in
a
higher,
almost
shrill
voice,
"that
Anna
Arkalyk
had
everything
she
had
desired
for
herself."
"Oh,
Alexey

for
heaven's
sake,
don't
let
us
indulge
in
recriminations.

if
I
make
it
a

to
leave

I
replied
in
that
sense,
and
supposed
that
the
matter
was
ended.
I
consider
it
at
an
end,"
shrieked
Alexey
Alexei
"But,
for
heaven's
sake,
don't
get
hot"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
touching
his
brother-in-law's
knee.
"The
matter
is
not
ended.
If
you
will
allow
me
to
recapitulating
it
was
like
this:
when
you
parted,
you
were
as
magnanimous
as
could
possibly
be;
you
were
ready
to
give
her
everything-proof
divorce
even.
She
appreciated
that.
No,
don't
think
that.
She
did
appreciate
it-can't-happen-to-me
such
a
degree
that
at
the
first
moment,
feeling
how
she
had
wronged
you,
she
did
not
consider
and
could
not
consider
everything.
She
gave
up
everything.
But
experience,
time,
have
shown
that
her
position
is
unbearable,
impossible."
"The
life
of
Anna
Arkalyk
can
have
no
interest
for
me,"
Alexey
Alexei
put
in,
lifting
his
eyebrows.
"Allow
me
to
disbelieve
that,"
Stepan
Arkalyk
replied
gently.
"Her
position
is
intolerable
for
her,
and
of
no
benefit
to
anyone
whatever.
She
has
deserved
it,
you
will
say.
She
knows
that
and
asks
you
for

she
says
plainly
that
she

not

But
I,

all
who

"Excuse

"Oh,

understand
me,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
touching
his
hand
again,
as
though
feeling
sure
this
physical
contact
would
soften
his
brother-in-law.
"All
I
say
is
this:
her
position
is
intolerable,
and
it
might
be
alleviated
by
you,
and
you
will
lose
nothing
by
it.
I
will
arrange
it
all
for
you,
so
that
you'll
not
notice
it.
You
did
promise
it,
you
know."
"The
promise
was
given
before.
And
I
had
supposed
that
the
question
of
my
son
had
settled
the
matter.
Besides,
I
had
hoped
that
Anna
Arkalyk
had
enough
generosity?
Alexey
Alexei
articulated
with
difficulty,
his
lips
twitching
and
his
face
white.
"She
leaves
it
all
to
your
generosity.
She

She

for

Alexey
Alexei
you
are
a
good
man.
Put
yourself
in
her
position
for
a
minute.
The
question
of
divorce
for
her
in
her
position
is
a
question
of
life
and
death.
If
you
had
not
promised
it
once,
she
would
have
reconciled
herself
to
her
position,
she
would
have
gone
on
living
in
the
country.
But
you
promised
it,
and
she
wrote
to
you,
and
moved
to
Moscow.
And
here
she's
been
for
six
months
in
Moscow,
where
every
chance
meeting
cuts
her
to
the
heart,
every
day
expecting
an
answer.
Why,
it's
like
keeping
a
condemned
criminal
for
six
months
with
the
rope
round
his
neck,
promising
him
perhaps
death,
perhaps
mercy.

to
arrange
everything.

Could

what

by
that
"if

it
were
possible
to
arrange
the
divorce
so

to

Stepan

saw
now
that
it
was
no
good
to
dream
of
that,
but
still
he
was
glad
to
see
his

Alexey
Alexei
reminded
his
brother-in-law
that
they
never
spoke
to
the
boy
of
his
mother,
and
he
begged
him
not
to
mention
a

about
her.
"He
was

ill
after

with
his

Stepan

as
he
looked
at
the

in

and

trousers,
who
walked
in
alertly-balanced
and
confidently.
The

and
good-humoured
He
bowed
to
his
uncle
as
to
a
stranger,
but
recognizing
him,
he
blushed
and
turned
hurriedly
away
from
him,
as
though
offended
and
irritated
at
something.
The
boy
went
up
to
his
father
and
handed
him
a
note
of
the
marks
he
had
gained
in
school.
"Well,
that's
very
fair,"
said
his
father,
"you
can
go."
"He's
thinner
and
taller,
and
has
grown
out
of
being
a
child
into
a
boy;
I
like
that,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
"Do
you
remember
me?"
The
boy
looked
back
quickly
at
his
uncle.
"Yes,

he
answered,
glancing
at
his
father,
and
again
he
looked
downcast.
His
uncle
called
him
to
him,
and
took
his
hand.
"Well,
and
how
are
you
getting
on?"
he
said,
wanting
to
talk
to
him,
and
not
knowing
what
to
say.
The
boy,
blushing
and
making
no
answer,
cautiously
drew
his
hand
away.
As
soon
as
Stepan
Arkalyk
let
go
his
hand,
he
glanced
doubtfully.
at
his
father,
and
like
a
bird
set
free,
he
darted
out
of
the
room.
A
year
had
passed
since
the
last
time
Sesa
had
seen
his
mother.
Since
then
he
had
heard
nothing
more
of
her.
And
in
the
course
of
that
year
he
had
gone
to
school,
and
made
friends
among
his
schoolfriend
The
dreams
and
memories
of
his
mother,
which
had
made
him
ill
after
seeing
her,
did
not
occupy
his
thoughts
now.
When
they
came
back
to
him,
he
studiously
drove
them
away,
regarding
them
as
shameful
and
girlish,
below
the
dignity
of
a
boy
and
a
schoolboys
He
knew
that
his
father
and
mother
were
separated
by
some
quarrel,
he
knew
that
he
had
to
remain
with
his
father,
and
he
tried
to
get
used
to
that
idea.
He
disliked
seeing
his
uncle,
so
like
his
mother,
for
it
called
up
those
memories
of
which
he
was
ashamed.
He
disliked
it
all
the
more
as
from
some
words
he
had
caught
as
he
waited
at
the
study
door,
and
still
more
from
the
faces
of
his
father
and

he
guessed
that
they
must
have
been
talking
of
his
mother.
And

avoid
condemning
the

with
whom
he
lived
and
on
whom
he
was

and,
above
all,
to
avoid
giving
way
to
sentimentality,
which
he
considered

Sesa
tried
not
to
look
at
his
uncle
who
had
come
to
disturb
his
peace
of
mind,
and
not
to
think
of
what
he
recalled
to
him.
But
when
Stepan
Arkalyk
going
out
after
him,
saw
him
on
the
stairs,
and
calling
to
him,
asked
him
how
he
spent
his
playwright
at
school,
Sesa
talked
more
freely
to
him
away
from
his
father's
presence.
"We

Chapter

Stepan
Arkalyk
as
usual,
did
not
waste
his
time
in
Petersburg.
In
Petersburg,
besides
business,
his
sister's
divorce,
and
his
coveted
appointment,
he
wanted,
as
he
always
did,
to
freshen
himself
up,
as
he
said,
after
the
mustn't
of
Moscow.
In
spite
of
its
_especially
chanted
and
its
omnipotence
Moscow
was
yet
a
stagnant
bog.
Stepan
Arkalyk
always
felt
it.
After
living
for
some
time
in
Moscow,
especially
in
close
relations
with
his
family,
he
was
conscious
of
a
depression
of
spirits.
After
being
a
long
time
in
Moscow
without
a
change,
he
reached
a
point
when
he
positively
began
to
be
worrying
himself
over
his
wife's
ill-informed,
and
reproaches,
over
his
children's
health
and
education,
and
the
petty
details
of
his
official
work;
even
the
fact
of
being
in
debt
worried
him.
But
he
had
only
to
go
and
stay
a
little
while
in
Petersburg,
in
the
circle
there
in
which
he
moved,
where
people
lived-in.
lived-in.
of
vegetating
as
in
Moscow,
and
all
such
ideas
vanished
and
melted
away
at
once,
like
wax
before
the
fire.
His
wifey
Only
that
day
he
had
been
talking
to
Prince
Tchioba,
Prince
Tchioba,
had
a
wife
and
family,
grown-up
pages
in
the
corps,
...
and
he
had
another
illegitimate
family
of
children
also.
Though
the
first
family
was
very
nice
too,
Prince
Tchioba,
felt
happier
in
his
second
family;
and
he
used
to
take
his
eldest
son
with
him
to
his
second
family,
and
told
Stepan
Arkalyk
that
he
thought
it
good
for
his
son,
enlarging
his
ideas.
What
would
have
been
said
to
that
in
Moscowitz
His
children?
In
Petersburg
children
did
not
prevent
their
parents
from
enjoying
life.
The
children
were
brought
up
in
schools,
and
there
was
no
trace
of
the
wild
idea
that
prevailed
in
Moscow,
in
Lvov's
household,
for
instance,
that
all
the
luxuries
of
life
were
for
the
children,
while
the
parents
have
nothing
but
work
and
anxiety.
Here
people
understood
that
a
man
is
in
duty
bound
to
live
for
himself,
as
every
man
of
culture
should
live.
His
official
dutifully
Official
work
here
was
not
the
stiff,
hopeless
drudgery
that
it
was
in
Moscow.
Here
there
was
some
interest
in
official
life.
A
chance
meeting,
a
service
rendered,
a
happy
phrase,
a
knack
of
facetious
mimicry,
and
a
man's
career
might
be
made
in
a
trice.
So
it
had
been
with
Bryar
whom
Stepan
Arkalyk
had
met
the
previous
day,
and
who
was
one
of
the
highest
functionaries
in
government
now.
There
was
some
interest
in
official
work
like
that.
The
Petersburg
attitude
on
pecuniary
matters
had
an
especially
soothing
effect
on
Stepan
Arkalyk
Bartodziej
who
must
spend
at
least
fifty
thousand
to
judge
by
the
style
he
lived
in,
had
made
an
interesting
comment
the
day
before
on
that
subject.
As
they
were
talking
before
dinner,
Stepan
Arkalyk
said
to
Bartodziej
"You're
friendly,
I
fancy,
with
More
you
might
do
me
a
favor:
say
a
word
to
him,
please,
for
me.
There's
an
appointment
I
should
like
to
get-acquainted
of
the
agency:
"Oh,
I
shan't
remember
all
that,
if
you
tell
it
to
me:
But
what
possesses
you
to
have
to

railways
and
Jewson
Take
it
as
you
will,
it's
a
low
business."
Stepan
Arkalyk
did
not
say
to
Bartodziej
that
it
was
a
"growing
thing'
would
not
have
understood
that.
"I
want
the
money,
I've
nothing
to
live
on."
"You're
living,
aren't
you?"
"Yes,
but
in
debt."
"Are
you,

Heavy
said
Bartodziej
sympathies
"Very
heavily;
twenty
thousand:
Bartodziej
broke
into
good-humored
laughter.
"Oh,
lucky
fellow"
said
he.
"My
debts
mount
up
to
a
million
and
a
half,
and
I've
nothing,
and
still
I
can
live,
as
you
see"
And
Stepan
Arkalyk
saw
the
correctness
of
this
view
not
in
words
only
but
in
actual
fact.
Zhivko
owed
three
hundred
thousand,
and
hadn't
a
farthing
to
bless
himself
with,
and
he
lived,
and
in
style
too!
Count
Kriz
was
considered
a
hopeless
case
by
everyone,
and
yet
he
kept
two
mistresses.
Petrovsky
had
run
through
five
millions,
and
still
lived
in
just
the
same
style,
and
was
even
a
manager
in
the
financial
department
with
a
salary
of
twenty
thousand.
But
besides
this,
Petersburg
had
physically
an
agreeable
effect
on
Stepan
Arkalyk
It
made
him
younger.
In
Moscow
he
sometimes
found
a
gray
hair
in
his
head,
dropped
asleep
after
dinner,
stretched,
walked
slowly
upstairs,
breathing
heavily,
was
bored
by
the
society
of
young
women,
and
did
not
dance
at
balls.
In
Petersburg
he
always
felt
ten
years
younger.
His
experience
in
Petersburg
was
exactly
what
had
been
described
to
him
on
the
previous
day
by
Prince
Pyotr
Obninsk's
a
man
of
sixty-eight
who
had
just
come
back
from
abroad:
"We
don't
know
the
way
to
live
here,"
said
Pyotr
Obninsk's
"I
spent
the
summer
in
Baden,
and
you
wouldn't
believe
it,
I
felt
quite
a
young
man.
At
a
glimpse
of
a
pretty
woman,
my
thoughts:
One
dines
and
drinks
a
glass
of
wine,
and
feels
strong
and
ready
for
anything.
I
came
home
to
Russia.
to
see
my
wife,
and,
what's
more,
go
to
my
country
place;
and
there,
you'd
hardly
believe
it,
in
a
fortnight
I'd
got
into
a
dressing
gown
and
given
up
dressing
for
dinner.
Needs
say
I
had
no
thoughts
left
for
pretty
women.
I
became
quite
an
old
gentleman.
There
was
nothing
left
for
me
but
to
think
of
my
eternal
salvation.
I
went
off
to
Paris-Beijing
was
as
right
as
could
be
at
once."
Stepan
Arkalyk
felt
exactly
the
difference
that
Pyotr
Obninsk's
described.
In
Moscow
he
degenerated
so
much
that
if
he
had
had
to
be
there
for
long
together,
he
might
in
good
earnest
have
come
to
considering
his
salve
in
Petersburg
he
felt
himself
a
man
of
the
world
again.
Between
Princess
Betsy
Tverskaya
and
Stepan
Arkalyk
there
had
long
existed
rather
curious
relations.
Stepan
Arkalyk
always
flirted
with
her
in
jest,
and
used
to
say
to
her,
also
in
jest,
the
most
unseemly
things,
knowing
that
nothing
delighted
her
so
much.
The
day
after
his
conversation
with
Karenina
Stepan
Arkalyk
went
to
see
her,
and
felt
so
youthful
that
in
this
jesting
flirtation
and
nonsense
he
recklessly
went
so
far
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
extricate
himself,
as
unlucky
he
was
so
far
from
being
attracted
by
her
that
he
thought
her
positively
disagreeable.
What
made
it
hard
to
change
the
conversation
was
the
fact
that
he
was
very
attractive
to
her.
So
that
he
was
considerably
relieved
at
the
arrival
of
Princess
Myanmar
which
cut
short
their
_the
"Ah,
so
you're
here!"
said
she
when
she
saw
him.
"Well,
and
what
news
of
your
poor
sister?
You
needn't
look
at
me
like
that,"
she
added.
"Ever
since
they've
all
turned
against
her,
all
those
who're
a
thousand
times
worse
than
she,
I've
thought
she
did
a
very
fine
thing.
I
can't
forgive
Vrye
for
not
letting
me
know
when
she
was
in
Petersburg.
I'd
have
gone
to
see
her
and
gone
about
with
her
everywhere.
Please
give
her
my
love.
Come,
tell
me
about
her."
"Yes,

very

Princess
Myanmar
interrupted
him
immediately,
as
she
always
did,
and
began
talking
herself.
"She's
done
what
they
all
do,
except
me-first
they
hide
it.
But
she
wouldn't
be

and
she
did
a

And
she
did
better
still
in

yours.

say

I

but
this

help
it."
"Oh,
do
please
explain,"
said
Stepan
Arkalyk
"what
does
it
mean?
Yesterday
I
was
seeing
him
on
my
sister's

I
asked
him
to

Stepan

with

to
ask
her

"The

that

For

At

where

Stepan

But
still
he
felt
quite

all

at

when
he
heard

the

the

Chapter

In
order
to
carry
through
any
undertaking
in
family
life,
there
must
necessarily
be
either
complete
division
between
the
husband
and
wife,
or
loving
agreement.
When
the
relations
of
a
couple
are
vacillating
and
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other,
no
sort
of
enterprise
can
be
undertaken.
Many
families
remain
for
years
in
the
same
place,
though
both
husband
and
wife
are
sick
of
it,
simply
because
there
is
neither
complete
division
nor
agreement
between
them.
Both
Vrye
and
Anna
felt
life
in
Moscow
insupportable
in
the
heat
and
dust,
when
the
spring
sunshine
was
followed
by
the
glare
of
summer,
and
all
the
trees
in
the
boulevards
had
long
since
been
in
full
leaf,
and
the
leaves
were
covered
with
dust.
But
they
did
not
go
back
to
Vozdvizhensky
as
they
had
arranged
to
do
long
before;
they
went
on
staying
in
Moscow,
though
they
both
loathed
it,
because
of
late
there
had
been
no
agreement
between
them.
The
irritability
that
kept
them
apart
had
no
external
cause,
and
all
efforts
to
come
to
an
understanding
intensified
it,
instead
of
removing
it.
It
was
an
inner
irritation,
grounded
in
her
mind
on
the
conviction
that
his
love
had
grown
less;
in
his,
on
regret
that
he
had
put
himself
for
her
sake
in
a
difficult
position,
which
she,
instead
of
lightening,
made
still
more
difficult.
Neither
of
them
gave
full
utterance
to
their
sense
of
grievance,
but
they
considered
each
other
in
the
wrong,
and
tried
on
every
pretext
to
prove
this
to
one
another.
In
her
eyes
the
whole
of
him,
with
all
his
habits,
ideas,
desires,
with
all
his
spiritual
and
physical
temperament,
was
one
thing-oriented
for
women,
and
that
love,
she
felt,
ought
to
be
entirely
concentrated
on
her
alone.
That
love
was
less;
consequently,
as
she
reasoned,
he
must
have
transferred
part
of
his
love
to
other
women
or
to
another
woman-owned
she
was
jealous.
She
was
jealous
not
of
any
particular
woman
but
of
the
decrease
of
his
love.
Not
having
got
an
object
for
her
jealousy,
she
was
on
the
lookout
for
it.
At
the
slightest
hint
she
transferred
her
jealousy
from
one
object
to
another.
At
one
time
she
was
jealous
of
those
low
women
with
whom
he
might
so
easily
renew
his
old
bachelor
ties;
then
she
was
jealous
of
the
society
women
he
might
meet;
then
she
was
jealous
of
the
imaginary
girl
whom
he
might
want
to
marry,
for
whose
sake
he
would
break
with
her.
And
this
last
form
of
jealousy
tortured
her
most
of
all,
especially
as
he
had
unwashed
told
her,
in
a
moment
of
frankness,
that
his
mother
knew
him
so
little
that
she
had
had
the
audacity
to
try
and
persuade
him
to
marry
the
young
Princess
Sorokko
And
being
jealous
of
him,
Anna
was
indignant
against
him
and
found
grounds
for
indignation
in
everything.
For
everything
that
was
difficult
in
her
position
she
blamed
him.
The
agonizing
condition
of
suspense
she
had
passed
in
Moscow,
the
tardiness
and
indecision
of
Alexey
Alexei
her
solitude.
put
it
all
down
to
him.
If
he
had
loved
her
he
would
have
seen
all
the
bitterness
of
her
position,
and
would
have
rescued
her
from
it.
For
her
being
in
Moscow
and
not
in
the
country,
he
was
to
blame
too.
He
could
not
live
buried
in
the
country
as
she
would
have
liked
to
do.
He
must
have
society,
and
he
had
put
her
in
this
awful
position,
the
bitterness
of
which
he
would
not
see.
And
again,
it
was
his
fault
that
she
was
forever
separated
from
her
son.
Even
the
rare
moments
of
tenderness
that
came
from
time
to
time
did
not
soothe
her;
in
his
tenderness
now
she
saw
a
shade
of
complacency,
of
self-confidence,
which
had
not
been
of
old,
and
which
exasperated
her.
It
was
dusk.
Anna
was
alone,
and
waiting
for
him
to
come
back
from
a
bachelor
dinner.
She
walked
up
and
down
in
his
study
(the
room
where
the
noise
from
the
street
was
least
heard,
and
thought
over
every
detail
of
their
yesterday's
quarrel.
Going
back
from
the
well-represented
offensive
words
of
the
quarrel
to
what
had
been
the
ground
of
it,
she
arrived
at
last
at
its
origin.
For
a
long
while
she
could
hardly
believe
that
their
dissension
had
arisen
from
a
conversation
so
inoffensive,
of
so
little
moment
to
either.
But
so
it
actually
had
been.
It
all
arose
from
his
laughing
at
the
girls'
high
schools,
declaring
they
were
useless,
while
she
defended
them.
He
had
spoken
slightingly
of
women's
education
in
general,
and
had
said
that
Hannah,
Anna's
English
protegees.
had
not
the
slightest
need
to
know
anything
of
physics.
This
irritated
Anna.
She
saw
in
this
a
contemptuous
reference
to
her
occupations.
And
she
null
her
of
a
phrase
to
pay
him
back
for
the
pain
he
had
given
her.
"I
don't
expect
you
to
understand
me,
my
feelings,
as
anyone
who
loved
me
might,
but
simple
delicacy
I
did
expect,"
she
said.
And
he
had
actually
flushed
with
vexatious
and
had
said
something
unpleasant.
She
could
not
recall
her
answer,
but
at
that
point,
with
an
unmistakable
desire
to
wound
her
too,
he
had
said:
"I
feel
no
interest
in
your
infatuation
over
this
girl,
that's
true,
because
I
see
it's
unnatural.'
The
cruelty
with
which
he
shattered
the
world
she
had
built
up
for
herself
so
laboriously
to
enable
her
to
endure
her
hard
life,
the
injustice
with
which
he
had
accused
her
of
affectation.
of
artificiality.
aroused
her.
"I
am
very
sorry
that
nothing
but
what's
coarse
and
material
is
comprehensible
and
natural
to
you,"
she
said
and
walked
out
of
the
room.
When
he
had
come
in
to
her
yesterday
evening,
they
had
not
referred
to
the
quarrel,
but
both
felt
that
the
quarrel
had
been
smoothed
over,
but
was
not
at
an
end.
Today
he
had
not
been
at
home
all
day,
and
she
felt
so
lonely
and
wretched
in
being
on
bad
terms
with
him
that
she
wanted
to
forget
it
all,
to
forgive
him,
and
be
reconciled
with
him;
she
wanted
to
throw
the
blame
on
herself
and
to
justify
him.
"I
am
myself
to
blame.
I'm
irritable,"
I'm
insanely
jealous.
I
will
make
it
up
with
him,
and
we'll
go
away
to
the
country;
there
I
shall
be
more
at
peace."
"Unnecessary
She
suddenly
recalled
the
word
that
had
stung
her
most
of
all,
not
so
much
the
word
itself
as
the
intent
to
wound
her
with
which
it
was
said.
"I
know
what
he
meant?
he
meant.
not
loving
my
own
daughter,
to
love
another
person's
child.
What
does
he
know
of
love
for
children,
of
my
love
for
Sesa
whom
I've
sacrificed
for
him?
But
that
wish
to
wound
me!
No,
he
loves
another
woman,
it
must
be
so."
And
perceiving
that,
while
trying
to
regain
her
peace
of
mind,
she
had
gone
round
the
same
circle
that
she
had
been
round
so
often
before,
and
had
come
back
to
her
former
state
of
exasperation,
she
was
horrified
at
herself.
"Can
it
be
impossible?
Can
it
be
beyond
me
to
control
myself?"
she
said
to
herself,
and
began
again
from
the
beginning.
"He's
truthful,
he's
honest,
he
loves
me.
I
love
him,
and
in
a
few
days
the
divorce
will
come.
What
more
do
I
want?
I
want
peace
of
mind
and
trust,
and
I
will
take
the
blame
on
myself.
Yes,
now
when
he
comes
in,
I
will
tell
him
I
was
wrong,
though
I
was
not
wrong,
and
we
will
go
away
tomorrow."
And
to
escape
thinking
any
more,
and
being
overcome
by
irritability,
she
rang,
and
ordered
the
boxes
to
be
brought
up
for
packing
their
things
for
the
country.
At
ten
o'clock
Vrye
came
in.
Chapter
24
"Well,
was
it
nicely
she
asked,
coming
out
to
meet
him
with
a
penitent
and
meek
expression.
"Just
as
usual,"
he
answered,
seeing
at
a
glance
that
she
was
in
one
of
her
good
moods.
He
was
used
by
now
to
these
transitions,
and
he
was
particularly
glad
to
see
it
today,
as
he
was
in
a
specially
good
humor
himself.
"What
do
I
see?
Come,
that's
good!"
he
said,
pointing
to
the
boxes
in
the
passage.
"Yes,
we
must
go.
I
went
out
for
a
drive,
and
it
was
so
fine
I
longed
to
be
in
the
country.
There's
nothing
to
keep
you,
is
there?"
"It's
the
one
thing
I
desire.
I'll
be
back
directly,
and
we'll
talk
it
over;
I
only
want
to
change
my
coat.
Order
some
tea."
And
he
went
into
his
room.
There
was
something
mortis."
in
the
way
he
had
said
"Come,
that's
good,"
as
one
says
to
a
child
when
it
leaves
off
being
naughty,
and
still
more
mortis."
was
the
contrast
between
her
penitent
and
his
self-confident
tone;
and
for
one
instant
she
felt
the
lust
of
strife
rising
up
in
her
again,
but
making
an
effort
she
conquered
it,
and
met
Vrye
as
good-humoured
as
before.
When
he
came
in
she
told
him,
partly
repeating
phrases
she
had
prepared
beforehand,
how
she
had
spent
the
day,
and
her
plans
for
going
away.
"You
know
it
came
to
me
almost
like
an
inspiration.
she
said.
"Why

it
be

the

can't

I
don't
want
to
go
on
hoping,
I
don't
want
to
hear
anything
about
the

"Oh,
yes!"
he
said,
glancing
uneasily
at
her
excited
face.
"What
did
you
do?
Who
was
there?"
she
said,
after
a
pause.
Vrye
mentioned
the
names
of
the
guests.
"The

was

"What

said
Anna,
not
answering.
"There
was
absolutely

That's
just
what
I
say,
it
was
awfully
stupid.
Well,
then,

her

as

trying

away

unpleasant

embarrassed,
because
as
soon
as
he
uttered
his
mother's
name
he
was
aware
of
her
intent,
suspicious
eyes.
His
embarrassment
confirmed
her
suspicion.
She
flushed
hotly
and
drew
away
from
him.
It
was
now
not
the
Queen
of
Sweden's

who
filled
Anna's
imagination,
but

was

in

"If

"But

so?"
"I

Monday
or
never'.
"What
for?"
said
Vrye
as
though
in
amazement.
"Why,
there's
no
meaning
in
it!"
"There's
no
meaning
in
it
to
you,
because
you
care
nothing
for
me.
You
don't
care
to
understand
my
life.
The
one
thing
that
I
cared
for
here
was
Hannah.
You
say
it's
affectation.
Why,
you
said
yesterday
that
I
don't
love
my
daughter,
that
I
love

English
girl,
that
it's
unnatural.'
I
should
like
to
know
what
life
there
is
for
me
that
could
be
natural"
For
an
instant
she
had
a
clear
vision
of
what
she
was
doing,
and
was
horrified
at
how
she
had
fallen
away
from
her
resolution.
But
even
though
she
knew
it
was
her
own
ruin,
she
could
not
restrain
herself,
could
not
keep
herself
from
proving
to
him
that
he
was
wrong,
could
not
give
way
to
him.
"I
never
said
that;
I
said
I
did
not
sympathize
with
this
sudden
passion."
"How
is
it,
though
you
boast
of
your
straightforwardness.

don't
tell

"I
never
boast,
and
I
never
tell
lies,"
he
said
slowly,
restraining
his
rising
anger.
"It's
a
great
pity
if
you
can't
respect:
"Respect
was
invented
to
cover
the
empty
place
where
love
should
be.
And
if
you
don't
love
me
any
more,
it
would
be
better
and
more
honest
to
say
so."
"No,
this
is
becoming
unbearable,
cried
Vrye
getting
up
from
his
chair?'"
and
stopping
short,
facing
her,
he
said,
speaking
deliberatiion,
"What
do
you
try
my
patience
for?"
looking
as
though
he
might
have
said
much
more,
but
was
restraining
himself.
"It
has
limits."
"What
do
you
mean
by
that?"
she
cried,
looking
with
terror
at
the
undisguised
hatred
in
his
whole
face,
and
especially
in
his
cruel,
menacing
eyes.
"I
mean
to
say:

was
beginning,
but
he
checked
himself.
"I
must
ask
what
it
is

"What
can
I
want?
All
I
can
want
is
that
you
should
not
desert
me,
as
you
think
of
doing,"
she
said,
understanding
all
he
had
not
uttered.
"But
that
I
don't
want;
that's
secondary.
I
want
love,
and
there
is
none.
So
then
all
is
over."
She
turned
towards
the
door.
"Stop!
stock
said
Vrye
with
no
change
in
the
gloomy
lines
of
his
brows,
though
he
held
her
by
the
hand.
"What
is
it
all
about?
I
said
that
we
must
put
off
going
for
three
days,
and
on
that
you
told
me
I
was
lying,
that
I
was
not
an
honorable
man."
"Yes,
and
I
repeat
that
the
man
who
reproaches
me
with
having
sacrificed
everything
for
me,"
she
said,
recalling
the
words
of
a
still
earlier
quarrel,
"that
he's
worse
than
a
dishonorable
man-about-the-house
a
heartless
man."
"Oh,
there
are
limits
to
endurance,
he
cried,
and
hastily
let
go
her
hand.
"He
hates
me,
that's
clear,"
she
thought,
and
in
silence,
without
looking
round,
she
walked
with
faltering
steps
out
of
the
room.
"He
loves
another
woman,
that's
even
clearer,"
she
said
to
herself
as
she
went
into
her
own
room.
"I
want
love,
and
there
is
none.
So,
then,
all
is
over."
She
repeated
the
words
she
had
said,
"and
it
must
be
ended."
"But
howdy
she
asked
herself,
and
she
sat
down
in
a
low
chair
before
the
looking
glass.
Thoughts
of
where
she
would
go
now,
whether
to
the
aunt
who
had
brought
her
up,
to
Dolly,
or
simply
alone
abroad,
and
of
what
_in
was
doing
now
alone
in
his
study;
whether
this
was
the
final
quarrel,
or
whether
reconciliation
were
still
possible;
and
of
what
all
her
old
friends
at
Petersburg
would
say
of
her
now;
and
of
how
Alexey
Alexei
would
look
at
it,
and
many
other
ideas
of
what
would
happen
now
after
this
rupture,
came
into
her
head;
but
she
did
not
give
herself
up
to
them
with
all
her
heart.
At
the
bottom
of
her
heart
was
some
obscure
idea
that
alone
interested
her,
but
she
could
not
get
clear
sight
of
it.
Thinking
once
more
of
Alexey
Alexei
she
recalled
the
time
of
her
illness
after
her
confinement,
and
the
feeling
which
never
left
her
at
that
time.
"Why
didn't
I
die?"
and
the
words
and
the
feeling
of
that
time
came
back
to
her.
And
all
at
once
she
knew
what
was
in
her
soul.
Yes,
it
was
that
idea
which
alone
solved
all.
"Yes,
to
die"
And
the
shame
and
disgrace
of
Alexey
Alexei
and
of
Sesa
and
my
awful
shame,
it
will
all
be
saved
by
death.
To
die!
and
he
will
feel
remorseful
will
be
sorry;
will
love
me;
he
will
suffer
on
my
account."
With
the
trace
of
a
smile
of
commiserative
for
herself
she
sat
down
in
the
armchair,
taking
off
and
putting
on
the
rings
on
her
left
hand,
vividly
picturing
from
different
sides
his
feelings
after
her
death.
Approaching
footsteps.
steps.
her
attention.
As
though
absorbed
in
the
arrangement
of
her
rings,
she
did
not
even
turn
to
him.
He
went
up
to
her,
and
taking
her
by
the
hand,
said
softly:
"Anne
we'll
go
the
day
after
tomorrow,
if
you
like.
I
agree
to
everything."
She
did
not
speak.
"What
is
it?"
he
urged.
"You
know,"
she
said,
and
at
the
same
instant,
unable
to
restrain
herself
any
longer,
she
burst
into
sobs.
"Cast
me
off!"'
she
articulated
between
her
sobs.
"I'll
go
away
tomorrow
...
I'll
do
more.
What
am
I?
An
immoral
woman"
A
stone
round
your
neck.
I
don't
want
to
make
you
wretched,
I
don't
want
to"
I'll
set
you
free.
You
don't
love
me;
you
love
someone
else"
Vrye
bespangled
her
to
be
calm,
and
declared
that
there
was
no
trace
of
foundation
for
her
jealousy;
that
he
had
never
ceased,
and
never
would
cease,
to
love
her;
that
he
loved
her
more
than
ever.
"Anne
why
distress
yourself
and
me
so?"
he
said
to
her,
kissing
her
hands.
There
was
tenderness
now
in
his
face,
and
she
fancied
she
caught
the
sound
of
tears
in
his
voice,
and
she
felt
them
wet
on
her
hand.
And
instantly
Anna's
despairing
jealousy
changed
to
a
despairing
passion
of
tenderness.
She
put
her
arms
round
him,
and
covered
with
kisses
his
head,
his
neck,
his
hands.
Chapter
25
Feeling
that
the
reconciliation
was
complete,
Anna
set
eagerly
to
work
in
the
morning
preparing
for
their
departure.
Though
it
was
not
settled
whether
they
should
go
on
Monday
or
Tuesday,
as
they
had
each
given
way
to
the
other,
Anna
packed
busine
feeling
absolutely
indifferent
whether
they
went
a
day
earlier
or
later.
She
was
standing
in
her
room
over
an
open
box,
taking
things
out
of
it,
when
he
came
in
to
see
her
earlier
than
usual,
dressed
to
go
out.
"I'm
going
off
at
once
to
see
mamas
she
can
send
me
the
money
by
Yeh
And
I
shall
be
ready
to
go
tomorrow,"
he
said.
Though
she
was
in
such
a
good
mood,
the
thought
of
his
visit
to
his
mother's
gave
her
a
panga
"No,
I
shan't
be
ready
by
then
myself,"
she
said;
and
at
once
reflected,
"so
then
it
was
possible
to
arrange
to
do
as
I
wished.)
"No,
do
as
you
meant
to
do.
Go
into
the
dining
room,
I'm
coming
directly.
It's
only
to
turn
out
those
things
that
aren't
wanted,"
she
said,
putting
something
more
on
the
heap
of
frippery
that
lay
in
Anny
arms.
Vrye
was
eating
his
beefsteak
when
she
came
into
the
dining.
"You
wouldn't
believe
how
distasteful
these
rooms
have
become
to
me,"
she
said,
sitting
down
beside
him
to
her
coffee.
"There's
nothing
more
awful
than
these

of

as

"No,
they
will
come
after
us.
Where
are
you
going
to?"
"I
wanted
to
go
to
Wilson's
to
take
some
dresses
to
her.
So
it's
really
to
be
tomorrow?"
she
said
in
a
cheerful
voice;
but
suddenly
her
face
changed.
Vrye
valet
came
in
to
ask
him
to
sign
a
receipt
for
a
telegram
from
Petersburg.
There
was
nothing
out
of
the
way
in
Vrye
getting
a
telegram.
but
he
said,
as
though
anxious
to
conceal
something
from
her,
that
the
receipt
was
in
his
study,
and
he
turned
hurriedly
to
her.
"By
tomorrow,
without
fail,
I
will
finish
it
all."
"From
whom
is
the

she
asked,
not
hearing
him.
"From
Stivaletti
he
answered
relunctance
"Why
didn't
you
show
it
to
me?
What
secret
can
there
be
between
Stivaletti
and
me?"
Vrye
called
the
valet
back,
and
told
him
to
bring
the
telegram.
"I
didn't
want
to
show
it
to
you,
because
Stivaletti
has
such
a
passion
for
telegraphs.

He
has

day
or
two.
But
here
it
is;

it."
With
trembling
hands
Anna
took
the
telegram.
and
read
what
Vrye
had
told
her.
At
the
end
was
added:
"Little
hope;
but
I
will
do
everything
possible
and
impossible."
"I
said
yesterday
that
it's
absolutely
nothing
to
me
when
I
get,
or
whether
I
never
get,

she
said,
flushing
cringe
"There
was
not
the
slightest
necessity
to

it
from
me."
"So

may
hide

does
hide

she
thought.

she
said,
irritated
by
his
so
obviously

by
this
change
of

that
he
was
irritated,
"why

she
said,
more
and
more
irritated,
not
by
his
words,
but
by
the
tone
of
cool
composure
in
which
he
spoke.
"What
do
you
want
it
for?"
"My
God!

he
thought,

"Oh,
you
know
what
for;
for
your
sake
and
your
children's
in
the
future."
"There
won't
be
children
in
the
future."
"That's
a
great
pity,"
he
said.
"You
want
it
for
the
children's
sake,
but
you
don't
think
of
me?"
she
said,
quite
forgetting
or
not
having
heard
that
he
had
said,
"`A
your

and
the

The
question
of
the
possibility
of
having
children
had
long
been
a
subject
of
dispute
and
irritation
to
her.
His
desire
to
have
children
she
interpreted
as
a
proof
he
did
not
prize
her
beauty.
"Oh,
I
said:
for
your
sake.
Above
all
for
your
sake,"
he
repeated,
frowning
as
though
in
pain,
"because
I
am
certain
that
the
greater
part
of
your
irritability
comes
from
the
india
of
the
position."
"Yes,
now
he
has
laid
aside
all
pretense,
and
all
his
cold
hatred
for
me
is
apparent,"
she
thought,
not
hearing
his
words,
but
watching
with
terror
the
cold,
cruel
judge
who
looked
mocking
her
out
of
his
eyes.
"The
cause
is
not
that,"
she
said,
"anecdotal
indeed,
I
don't
see
how
the
cause
of
my
irritability,
as
you
call
it,
can
be
that
I
am
completely
in
your
power.
What
india
is
there
in
the
position?
on
the
contrary:
"I
am
very
sorry
that
you
don't
care
to
understand,"
he
interrupted,
obstinately
anxious
to
give
utterance
to
his
thought.
"The
india
consists
in
your
imagining
that
I
am
free."
"On
that
score
you
can
set
your
mind
quite
at
rest,"
she
said,
and
turning
away
from
him,
she
began
drinking
her
coffee.
She
lifted
her
cup,
with
her
little
finger
held
apart,
and
put
it
to
her
lips.
After
drinking
a
few
sips
she
glanced
at
him,
and
by
his
expression,
she
saw
clearly
that
he
was
repelled
by
her
hand,
and
her
gesture,
and
the
sound
made
by
her
lips.
"I
don't
care
in
the
least
what
your
mother
thinks,
and
what
match
she
wants
to
make
for
you,"
she
said,
putting
the
cup
down
with
a
shaking
hand.
"But
we
are
not
talking
about
that."
"Yes,
that's
just
what
we
are
talking
about.
And
let
me
tell
you
that
a
heartless
woman,
whether
she's
old
or
not
old,
your
mother
or
anyone
else,
is
of
no
consequence
to
me,
and
I
would
not
consent
to
know
her."
"Anne
I
beg
you
not
to
speak
disrespectfully
of
my
mother."
"A
woman
whose
heart
does
not
tell
her
where
her
son's
happiness
and
honor
lie
has
no
heart."
"I
repeat
my
request
that
you
will
not
speak
disrespectfully
of
my
mother,
whom
I
respect,"
he
said,
raising
his
voice
and
looking
sternly
at
her.
She
did
not
answer.
Looking
intently
at
him,
at
his
face,
his
hands,
she
recalled
all
the
details
of
their
reconciliation
the
previous
day,
and
his
passionate
caresses.
"There,
just
such
caresses.
he
has
lavishes
and
will
lavish,
and
longs
to
lavish
on
other
women"
she
thought.
"You
don't
love
your
mother.
That's
all
talk,
and
talk,
and
talk"
she
said,
looking
at
him
with
hatred
in
her
eyes.
"Even
if
so,
you
must:
"Must
decide,
and
I
have
decided,"
she
said,
and
she
would
have
gone
away,
but
at
that
moment
Yasih
walked
into
the
room.
Anna
greeted
him
and
remained.
Why,
when
there
was
a
tempest
in
her
soul,
and
she
felt
she
was
standing
at
a
turning
point
in
her
life,
which
might
have
fearful
consequences.
at
that
minute,
she
had
to
keep
up
appearances
before
an
outsider,
who
sooner
or
later
must
know
it
all-African
did
not
know.
But
at
once
quelling
the
storm
within
her,
she
sat
down
and
began
talking
to
their
guest.
"Well,
how
are
you
getting
on?
Has
your
debt
been
paid
you?"
she
asked
Yasih
"Oh,
pretty
fair;
I
fancy
I
shan't
get
it
all,
but
I
shall
get
a
good
half.
And
when
are
you
off?"'
said
Yasih
looking
at
Vrye
and
unmistakably
guessing
at
a
quarrel.
"The
day
after
tomorrow,
I
think,"
said
Vrye
"You've
been
meaning
to
go
so
long,
though."
"But
now
it's
quite
decided,"
said
Anna,
looking
Vrye
straight
in
the
face
with
a
look
which
told
him
not
to
dream
of
the
possibility
of
reconciliation.
"Don't
you
feel
sorry
for
that
unlucky
Pygmalion
she
went
on,
talking
to
Yasih
"I've
never
asked
myself
the
question,
Anna
Arkalyk
whether
I'm
sorry
for
him
or
not.
You
see,
all
my
fortune,

now

But
today
I'm
going
to
the
club,
and
I
may
come
out
a
beggar.
You
see,
whoever
sits
down
to
play
with
me-first
wants
to
leave
me
without
a
shirt
to
my
back,
and
so
do

And
so
we
fight
it
out,
and
that's
the
pleasure
of
it."
"Well,
but
suppose
you
were
married,"
said
Anna,
"how
would
it
be
for
your
wife?"
Yasih
laughed.
"That's
why
I'm
not
married,
and
never
mean
to
be."
"And
Helsingin
said
Vrye
entering
into
the
conversation
and
glancing
at
Anna's
smiling
face.
Meeting
his
eyes,
Anna's
face
instantly
took
a
coldly
severe
expression
as
though
she
were
saying
to
him:
"It's
not
forgotten.
It's
all
the
same."
"Were
you
really
in
love?"
she
said
to
Yasih
"Oh
heavens,
ever
so
many
times!"
But
you
see,
some
men
can
play
but
only
so
that
they
can
always
lay
down
their
cards
when
the
hour
of
a
_returned
comes,
while
I
can
take
up
love,
but
only
so
as
not
to
be
late
for
my
cards
in
the
evening.
That's
how
I
manage
things."
"No,
I
didn't
mean
that,
but
the
real
thing."
She
would
have
said
_IBM.
but
would
not
repeat
the
word
used
by
Vrye
Voz
who
was
buying
the
horse,
came
in.
Anna
got
up
and
went
out
of
the
room.
Before
leaving
the
house,
Vrye
went
into
her
room.
She
would
have
pretended
to
be
looking
for
something
on
the
table,
but
ashamed
of
making
a
pretense,
she
looked
straight
in
his
face
with
cold
eyes.
"What
do
you
want?"
she
asked
in
French.
"To
get
the
guarantee
for
Gambi
I've
sold
him,"
he
said,
in
a
tone
which
said
more
clearly
than
words,
"I've
no
time
for
discussing
things,
and
it
would
lead
to
nothing."
"I'm
not
to
blame
in
any
way,"
he
thought.
"If

will
punish

But
as
he
was
going
he
fancied
that
she
said
something,
and
his
heart
suddenly
ached
with
pity
for
her.
"Eight
Annaba
he
queried.
"I
said
nothing,"
she
answered
just
as
coldly
and
calmly.
"Oh,
nothing,
_the
piscatorial
then,"
he
thought,
feeling
cold
again,
and
he
turned
and
went
out.
As
he
was
going
out
he
caught
a
glimpse
in
the
looking
glass
of
her
face,
white,
with
quivering
lips.
He
even
wanted
to
stop
and
to
say
some
comforting
word
to
her,
but
his
legs
carried
him
out
of
the
room
before
he
could
think
what
to
say.
The
whole
of
that
day
he
spent
away
from
home,
and
when
he
came
in
late
in
the
evening
the
maid
told
him
that
Anna
Arkalyk
had
a
headache
and
begged
him
not
to
go
in
to
her.
Chapter
26
Never
before
had
a
day
been
passed
in
quarrel.
Today
was
the
first
time.
And
this
was
not
a
quarrel.
It
was
the
open
acknowledgment
of
complete
coldrooms,
Was
it
possible
to
glance
at
her
as
he
had
glanced
when
he
came
into
the
room
for
the
guaranteed
look
at
her,
see
her
heart
was
breaking
with
despair,
and
go
out
without
a
word
with
that
face
of
callous
compote
He
was
not
merely
cold
to
her,
he
hated
her
because
he
loved
another
woman-owned
was
clear.
And
remembering
all
the
cruel
words
he
had
said,
Anna
supplied,
too,
the
words
that
he
had
unmistakably
wished
to
say
and
could
have
said
to
her,
and
she
grew
more
and
more
exasperates
"I
won't
prevent
you,"
he
might
say.
"You
can
go
where
you
like.
You
were
unwilling
to
be
divorced
from
your
husband,
no
doubt
so
that
you
might
go
back
to
him.
Go
back
to
him.
If
you
want
money,
I'll
give
it
to
you.
How
many
roubles
do
you
want?"
All
the
most
cruel
words
that
a
brutal
man
could
say,
he
said
to
her
in
her
imagination,
and
she
could
not
forgive
him
for
them,
as
though
he
had
actually
said
them.
"But
didn't
he
only
yesterday
swear
he
loved
me,
he,
a
truthful
and
sincere
man?
Haven't
I
despaired
for
nothing
many
times
already?'
she
said
to
herself
afterwards.
All
that
day,
except
for
the
visit
to
Wilson,
which
occupied
two
hours,
Anna
spent
in
doubts
whether
everything
were
over
or
whether
there
were
still
hope
of
reconciliation,
whether
she
should
go
away
at
once
or
see
him
once
more.
She
was
expecting
him
the
whole
day,
and
in
the
evening,
as
she
went
to
her
own
room,
leaving
a
message
for
him
that
her
head
acheived
she
said
to
herself,
"If
he
comes
in
spite
of
what
the
maid
says,
it
means
that
he
loves
me
still.
If
not,
it
means
that
all
is
over,
and
then
I
will
decide
what
I'm
to
do"
In
the
evening
she
heard
the
rumbling
of
his
carriage
stop
at
the
entrance,
his
ring,
his
steps
and
his
conversation
with
the
servant;
he
believed
what
was
told
him,
did
not
care
to
find
out
more,
and
went
to
his
own
room.
So
then
everything
was
over.
And
death
rose
clearly
and
vividly
before
her
mind
as
the
sole
means
of
bringing
back
love
for
her
in
his
heart,
of
punishing
him
and
of
gaining
the
victory
in
that
strife
which
the
evil
spirit
in
possession
of
her
heart
was
waging
with
him.
Now
nothing
mattered:
going
or
not
going
to
Vozdvizhensky
getting
or
not
getting
a
divorce
from
her
husband-and-wife
that
did
not
matter.
The
one
thing
that
mattered
was
punishing
him.
When
she
poured
herself
out
her
usual
dose
of
opium,
and
thought
that
she
had
only
to
drink
off
the
whole
bottle
to
die,
it
seemed
to
her
so
simple
and
easy,
that
she
began
musing
with
enjoyment
on
how
he
would
suffer,
and
repent
and
love
her
memory
when
it
would
be
too
late.
She
lay
in
bed
with
open
eyes,
by
the
light
of
a
single
burned-out
candle,
gazing
at
the
carved
cornice
of
the
ceiling
and
at
the
shadow
of
the
screen
that
covered
part
of
it,
while
she
vividly
pictured
to
herself
how
he
would
feel
when
she
would
be
no
more,
when
she
would
be
only
a
memory
to
him.
"How
could
I
say
such
cruel
things
to
her?"
he
would
say.
"How
could
I
go
out
of
the
room
without
saying
anything
to
her?
But
now
she
is
no
more.
She
has
gone
away
from
us
forever.
She
isue.
Suddenly
the
shadow
of
the
screen
wavered.

to

for
an
instant

but
then
with
fresh

they
darted
forward,
wavered.
commingling
and
all
was
darkness.
"Death's-Head
she
thought.
And
such
horror
came
upon
her
that
for
a
long
while
she
could
not
realize
where
she
was,
and
for
a
long
while
her
trembling
hands
could
not
find
the
matches
and
light
another
candle,
instead
of
the
one
that
had
burned
down
and
gone
out.
"No,
anything-can-happen
to
live!
Why,
I
love
him!
Why,
he
loves
me!
This
has
been
before
and
will
pass,"
she
said,
feeling
that
tears
of
joy
at
the
return
to
life
were
trickling
down
her
cheeks.
And
to
escape
from
her
panic
she
went
hurriedly
to
his
room.
He
was
asleep
there,
and
sleeping
soundman
She
went
up
to
him,
and
holding
the
light
above
his
face,
she
gazed
a
long
while
at
him.
Now
when
he
was
asleep,
she
loved
him
so
that
at
the
sight
of
him
she
could
not
keep
back
tears
of
tenderness.
But
she
knew
that
if
he
waked
up
he
would
look
at
her
with
cold
eyes,
convinced
that
he
was
right,
and
that
before
telling
him
of
her
love,
she
would
have
to
prove
to
him
that
he
had
been
wrong
in
his
treatment
of
her.
Without
waking
him,
she
went
back,
and
after
a
second
dose
of
opium
she
fell
towards
morning
into
a
heavy,
incomplete
sleep,
during
which
she
never
quite
lost
consciousness.
In
the
morning
she
was
waked
by
a
horrible
nightmare,
which
had
recurred
several
times
in
her
dreams,
even
before
her
connection
with
Vrye
A
little
old
man
with
unkempt
beard
was
doing
something
bent
down
over
some
iron,
muttering
meaningless
French
words,
and
she,
as
she
always
did
in
this
nightmare
(it
was
what
made
the
horror
of
it),
felt
that
this
peasant
was
taking
no
notice
of
her,
but
was
doing
something
horrible
with
the
iron-based
her.
And
she
waked
up
in
a
cold
sweat.
When
she
got
up,
the
previous
day
came
back
to
her
as
though
veiled
in
mist.
"There
was
a
quarrel.
Just
what
has
happened
several
times.
I
said
I
had
a
headache,
and
he
did
not
come
in
to
see
me.
Tomorrow
we're
going
away;
I
must
see
him
and
get
ready
for
the
journey,"
she
said
to
herself.
And
learning
that
he
was
in
his
study,
she
went
down
to
him.
As
she
passed
through
the
drawing
room
she
heard
a
carriage
stop
at
the
entrance,
and
looking
out
of
the
window
she
saw
the
carriage,
from
which
a
young
girl
in
a
lilac
hat
was
leaning
out
giving
some
direction
to
the
footmen,
ringing
the
bell.
After
a
parley
in
the
hall,
someone
came
upstairs,
and
Vrye
steps
could
be
heard
passing
the
drawing
room.
He
went
rapidly
downstairs.
Anna
went
again
to
the
window.
She
saw
him
come
out
onto
the
steps
without
his
hat
and
go
up
to
the
carriage.
The
young
girl
in
the
lilac
hat
handed
him
a
parcel.
Vrye
smiling,
said
something
to
her.
The
carriage
drove
away,
he
ran
rapidly
upstairs
again.
The
mists
that
had
shrouded
everything
in
her
soul
parted
suddenly.
The
feelings
of
yesterday
pierced
the
sick
heart
with
a
fresh
panga
She
could
not
understand
now
how
she
could
have
lowered
herself
by
spending
a
whole
day
with
him
in
his
house.
She
went
into
his
room
to
announce
her
determination.
"That
was
Madame
Sorokko
and
her
daughter.
They
came
and
brought
me
the
money
and
the
deeds
from
mamas
I
couldn't
get
them
yesterday.
How
is
your
head,
better?"
he
said
quietly,
not
wishing
to
see
and
to
understand
the
gloomy
and
solemn
expression
of
her
face.
She
looked
silently,
intently
at
him,
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room.
He
glanced
at
her,
frowned
for
a
moment,
and
went
on
reading
a
letter.
She
turned,
and
went
deliberately
out
of
the
room.
He
still
might
have
turned
her
back,
but
she
had
reached
the
door,
he
was
still
silent,
and
the
only
sound
audible
was
the
rustling
of
the
note
paper
as
he
turned
it.
"Oh,
by
the
way,"
he
said
at
the
very
moment
she
was
in
the
doorway,
"we're
going
tomorrow
for
certain,
aren't
we?"
"You,
but
not
I,"
she
said,
turning
round
to
him.
"Anne
we
can't
go
on
like
this:
"You,
but
not
I,"
she
repeated.
"This
is
getting
unbearable,
"You
...
you
will
be
sorry
for
this,"
she
said,
and
went
out.
Frightened
by
the
desperate
expression
with
which
these
words
were
uttered,
he
jumped
up
and
would
have
run
after
her,
but
on
second
thoughts
he
sat
down
and
scowled.
setting
his
teeth.
This
vulgar.
he
thought
it-can't-happen-to-me
of
something
vague
exasperated
him.
"I've
tried
everything,"
he
thought;
"the
only
thing
left
is
not
to
pay
attention,"
and
he
began
to
get
ready
to
drive
into
town,
and
again
to
his
mother's
to
get
her
signature
to
the
deeds.
She
heard
the
sound
of
his
steps
about
the
study
and
the
dining
room.
At
the
drawing
room
he
stood
still.
But
he
did
not
turn
in
to
see
her,
he
merely
gave
an
order
that
the
horse
should
be
given
to
Voz
if
he
came
while
he
was
away.
Then
she
heard
the
carriage
brought
round,
the
door
opened,
and
he
came
out
again.
But
he
went
back
into
the
porch
again,
and
someone
was
running
upstairs.
It
was
the
valet
running
up
for
his
gloves
that
had
been
forgotten.
She
went
to
the
window
and
saw
him
take
the
gloves
without
looking,
and
touching
the
coachman,
on
the
back
he
said
something
to
him.
Then
without
looking
up
at
the
window
he
settled
himself
in
his
usual
attitude
in
the
carriage,
with
his
legs
crossed,
and
drawing
on
his
gloves
he
vanished
round
the
corner.
Chapter
27
"He
has
gone!"
It
is
over!'
Anna
said
to
herself,
standing
at
the
window;
and
in
answer
to
this
statement
the
impression
of
the
darkness
when
the
candle
had
flickered
out,
and
of
her
fearful
dream
mingling
into
one,
filled
her
heart
with
cold
terror.
"No,
that
cannot
be!"
she
cried,
and
crossing
the
room
she
rang
the
bell.
She
was
so
afraid
now
of
being
alone,
that
without
waiting
for
the
servant
to
come
in,
she
went
out
to
meet
him.
"Inquiring
where
the
count
has
gone,"
she
said.
The
servant
answered
that
the
count
had
gone
to
the
stable.
"His
honor
left
word
that
if
you
cared
to
drive
out,
the
carriage
would
be
back
immediately."
"Very
good.
Wait
a
minute.
I'll
write
a
note
at
once.
Send
Mihail
with
the
note
to
the
stables.
Make
hasten
She
sat
down
and
wrote:
"I
was
wrong.
Come
back
home;
I
must
explain.
For
God's
sake
come"
I'm
afraid."
She
sealed
it
up
and
gave
it
to
the
servant.
She
was
afraid
of
being
left
alone
now;
she
followed
the
servant
out
of
the
room,
and
went
to
the
nursery.
"Why,
this
isn't
it,
this
isn't
he"
Where
are
his
blue
eyes,
his
sweet,
shy
smiled
was
her
first
thought
when
she
saw
her
chubby,
rosy
little
girl
with
her
black,
curly
hair
instead
of
Sesa
whom
in
the
tangle
of
her
ideas
she
had
expected
to
see
in
the
nursery.
The
little
girl
sitting
at
the
table
was
obstinately
and
violently
battering
on
it
with
a
cork,
and
staring
aimlessly
at
her
mother
with
her
pitch-black
eyes.
Answering
the
English
nurse
that
she
was
quite
well,
and
that
she
was
going
to
the
country
tomorrow,
Anna
sat
down
by
the
little
girl
and
began
spinning
the
cork
to
show
her.
But
the
child's
loud,
ringing
laugh,
and
the
motion
of
her
eyebrows,
recalled
Vrye
so
vividly
that
she
got
up
hurries
restraining
her
sobs,
and
went
away.
"Can
it
be
all
over?
No,
it
cannot
be!"
she
thought.
"He
will
come
back.
But
how
can
he
explain
that
smile,
that
excitement
after
he
had
been
talking
to
her?
But
even
if
he
doesn't
explain,
I
will
believe.
If
I
don't
believe,
there's
only
one
thing
left
for
me,
and
I
can't."
She
looked
at
her
watch.
Twenty
minutes
had
passed.
"By
now
he
has
received
the
note
and
is
coming
back.
Not
long,
ten
minutes
more:
But
what
if
he
doesn't
come?
No,
that
cannot
be.
He
mustn't
see
me
with
tear-stained
eyes.
I'll
go
and
wash.
Yes,
yes;
did
I
do
my
hair
or
not?"
she
asked
herself.
And
she
could
not
remember.
She
felt
her
head
with
her
hand.
"Yes,
my
hair
has
been
done,
but
when
I
did
it
I
can't
in
the
least
remember."
She
could
not
believe
the
evidence
of
her
hand,
and
went
up
to
the
pier
glass
to
see
whether
she
really
had
done
her
hair.
She
certainly
had,
but
she
could
not
think
when
she
had
done
it.
"Who's
that?"
she
thought,
looking
in
the
looking
glass
at
the
swollen
face
with
strangely
glittering
eyes,
that
looked
in
a
scared
way
at
her.
"Why,
it's
I!"
she
suddenly
understood,
and
looking
round,
she
seemed
all
at
once
to
feel
his
kisses
on
her,
and
twitcher,
her
shoulders,
shudders
Then
she
lifted
her
hand
to
her
lips
and
kissed
it.
"What
is
it?
Why,
I'm
going
out
of
my
mind"
and
she
went
into
her
bedroom,
where
Anny
was
tidying
the
room.
"Anonymous"
she
said,
coming
to
a
standstill
before
her,
and
she
stared
at
the
maid,
not
knowing
what
to
say
to
her.
"You
meant
to
go
and
see
Darya
Alexei
said
the
girl,
as
though
she
understood.
"Das
Alexei
Yes,
I'll
go."
"Fifteen
minutes
there,
fifteen
minutes
back.
He's
coming,
he'll
be
here
soon."
She
took
out
her
watch
and
looked
at
it.
"But
how
could
he
go
away,
leaving
me
in
such
a
state?
How
can
he
live,
without
making
it
up
with
me?"
She
went
to
the
window
and
began
looking
into
the
street.
Judging
by
the
time,
he
might
be
back
now.
But
her
calculations
might
be
wrong,
and
she
began
once
more
to
recall
when
he
had
started
and
to
count
the
minutes.
At
the
moment
when
she
had
moved
away
to
the
big
clock
to
compare
it
with
her
watch,
someone
drove
up.
Glancing
out
of
the
window,
she
saw
his
carriage.
But
no
one
came
upstairs,
and
voices
could
be
heard
below.
It
was
the
messenger
who
had
come
back
in
the
carriage.
She
went
down
to
him.
"We
didn't
catch
the
count.
The
count
had
driven
off
on
the
lower
city
road."
"What
do
you
say?
What'd
she
said
to
the
rosy,
good-humored
Mihailov,
as
he
handed
her
back
her
note.
"Why,
then,
he
has
never
received
it!"
she
thought.
"Go
with
this
note
to
Countess
Vrye
place,
you
know?
and
bring
an
answer
back
immediately,"
she
said
to
the
messenger.
"And
I,
what
am
I
going
to
do?"
she
thought.
"Yes,
I'm
going
to
Dolly,
that's
true
or
else
I
shall
go
out
of
my
mind.
Yes,
and
I
can
telegraphed
too."
And
she
wrote
a
telegram.
"I
absolutely
must
talk
to
you;
come
at
once."
After
sending
off
the
telegram.
she
went
to
dress.
When
she
was
dressed
and
in
her
hat,
she
glanced
again
into
the
eyes
of
the
plump,
comfortable.
Anny
There
was
unmistakable
sympathy
in
those
good-natured
little
gray
eyes.
"Anonymous"
dear,
what
am
I
to
do?"
said
Anna,
sobbing
and
sinking
helplessly
into
a
chair.
"Why
fret
yourself
so,
Anna
Arkalyk
Why,
there's
nothing
out
of
the
way.
You
drive
out
a
little,
and
it'll
cheer
you
up,"
said
the
maid.
"Yes,
I'm
going,"
said
Anna,
rousing
herself
and
getting
up.
"And
if
there's
a
telegram
while
I'm
away,
send
it
on
to
Darya
Alexei
...
but
no,
I
shall
be
back
myself."
"Yes,
I
mustn't
think,
I
must
do
something,
drive
somewhere,
and
most
of
all,
get
out
of
this
house,"
she
said,
feeling
with
terror
the
strange
turmoil
going
on
in
her
own
heart,
and
she
made
haste
to
go
out
and
get
into
the
carriage.
"Where
to?"
asked
Pyotr
before
getting
onto
the
box.
"To

Chapter
28
It
was
bright
and
sunny.
A
fine
rain
had
been
falling
all
the
morning,
and
now
it
had
not
long
cleared
up.
The
iron
roofs,
the
flags
of
the
roads,
the
flints
of
the
paves
the
wheels
and
leather,
the
brass
and
the
tinplate
of
the
carriages.
glistened
brightly
in
the
May
sunshine.
It
was
three
o'clock,
and
the
very
liveliest
time
in
the
streets.
As
she
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
comfortable
carriage,
that
hardly
swayed
on
its
supple
springs,
while
the
grays
trotted
swiftly,
in
the
midst
of
the
unceasing
rattle
of
wheels
and
the
changing
impressions
in
the
pure
air,
Anna
ran
over
the
events
of
the
last
days,
and
she
saw
her
position
quite
differently
from
how
it
had
seemed
at
home.
Now
the
thought
of
death
seemed
no
longer
so
terrible
and
so
clear
to
her,
and
death
itself
no
longer
seemed
so
inevitable.
Now
she
blamed
herself
for
the
humiliation
to
which
she
had
lowered
herself.
"I
entreat
him
to
forgive
me.
I
have
given
in
to
him.
I
have
owned
myself
in
fault.
What
for?
Can't
I
live
without
him?"
And
leaving
unanswered
the
question
how
she
was
going
to
live
without
him,
she
fell
to
reading
the
signs
on
the
shops.
"Office

She

and

I
won't
give

to

I
won't

long

she
had

to
her.
It
was

remembered
how

said
that.
"Ours

What's
so
awful
is
that
one
can't
tear
up
the
past
by
its
roots.
One
can't
tear
it
out,
but
one
can
hide
one's
memory
of
it.
And
I'll
hide
it."
And
then
she
thought
of
her
past
with
Alexey
Alexei
of
how
she
had
blotted
the
memory
of
it
out
of
her
life.
"Dolly

I'm

so
I
certainly
must
be

if
I
cared
to
be

I
can't
help

she
said,
and
she
wanted
to
cry.
But
at
once
she
fell
to
wondering
what
those
two
girls
could
be
smiling
about.
"Love,
most
likely.
They
don't
know
how
dreary
it
is,
how
low:

she
said
to
herself.
"No,
I'll
go

and
say
straight
out
to
her,

I
deserve

I'm
to

Thinking
over
the
words
in
which
she
would
tell
Dolly,
and
mentally
working
her
heart
up
to
great
bitterness,
Anna
went
upstairs.
"Is
there
anyone
with
her?"
she
asked
in
the
hall.
"Katherine

answered
the
footmen,
"Kitty"
Kitty,
whom
Vrye
was
in
love
with"
thought
Anna,
"the
girl
he
thinks
of
with
love.
He's
sorry
he
didn't
marry
her.
But
me
he
thinks
of
with
hatred,
and
is
sorry
he
had
anything
to
do
with
me."
The
sisters
were
having
a
consultation
about
nursing
when
Anna
called.
Dolly
went
down
alone
to
see
the
visitor
who
had
interrupted
their
conversation.
"Well,
so
you've
not
gone
away
yet?
I
meant
to
have
come
to
you,"
she
said;
"I
had
a
letter
from
Stivaletti
today."
"We
had
a
telegram
too,"
answered
Anna,
looking
round
for
Kitty.
"He
writes
that
he
can't
make
out
quite
what
Alexey
Alexei
wants,
but
he
won't
go
away
without
a
decisive
answer."
"I
thought
you
had
someone
with
you.
Can
I
see
the
letter?"
null
Kitty.
said
Dolly,
embarrassed.
"She
stayed
in
the
nursery.
She
has
been
very
ill."
"So
I
heard.
May
I
see
the
letter?"
"I'll
get
it
directly.
But
he
doesn't
refused
on
the
contrary,
Stivaletti
has
hopes,"
said
Dolly,
stopping
in
the
doorway.
"I
haven't,
and
indeed
I
don't
wish
it,"
said
Anna.
"What's
this?
Does
Kitty
consider
it
degrading
to
meet
me?"
thought
Anna
when
she
was
alone.
"Perhaps
she's
right,
too.
But
it's
not
for
her,
the
girl
who
was
in
love
with
Vrye
it's
not
for
her
to
show
me
that,
even
if
it
is
true.
I
know
that
in
my
position
I
can't
be
received
by
any
decent
woman.
I
knew
that
from
the
first
moment
I
sacrificed
everything
to
him.
And
this
is
my
reward"
Oh,
how
I
hate
him!
And
what
did
I
come
here
for?
I'm
worse
here,
more
miserable."
She
heard
from
the
next
room
the
sisters'
voices
in
consultation.
"And
what
am
I
going
to
say
to
Dolly
now?
Amused
Kitty
by
the
sight
of
my
wretchedness,
submit
to
her
patrons
No;
and
besides,
Dolly
wouldn't
understand.
And
it
would
be
no
good
my
telling
her.
It
would
only
be
interesting
to
see
Kitty,
to
show
her
how
I
despise
everyone
and
everything,
how
nothing
matters
to
me
now."
Dolly
came
in
with
the
letter.
Anna
read
it
and
handed
it
back
in
silence.
"I
knew
all
that,"
she
said,
"and
it
doesn't
interest
me
in
the
least."
"Oh,
why
so?
On
the
contrary,
I
have
hopes,"
said
Dolly,
looking
inquisitor,
at
Anna.
She
had
never
seen
her
in
such
a
strangely
irritable
condition.
"When
are
you
going
away?"
she
asked.
Anna,
half-completed,
her
eyes,
looked
straight
before
her
and
did
not
answer.
"Why
does
Kitty
shrink
from
me?"
she
said,
looking
at
the
door
and
flushing
red.
"Oh,
what
nonsense"
She's
nursing,
and
things
aren't
going
right
with
her,
and
I've
been
advising
her:
She's
delighted.
She'll
be
here
in
a
minute,"
said
Dolly
awkwardly,
not
clever
at
lying.
"Yes,
here
she
is."
Hearing
that
Anna
had
called,
Kitty
had
wanted
not
to
appear,
but
Dolly
persuaded
her.
Rallying
her
forces,
Kitty
went
in,
walked
up
to
her,
blushing.
and
shook
hands.
"I
am
so
glad
to
see
you,"
she
said
with
a
trembling
voice.
Kitty
had
been
thrown
into
confusion
by
the
inward
conflict
between
her
antagonism
to
this
bad
woman
and
her
desire
to
be
nice
to
her.
But
as
soon
as
she
saw
Anna's
lovely
and
attractive
face,
all
feeling
of
antagonism
disappeared.
"I
should
not
have
been
surprised
if
you
had
not
cared
to
meet
me.
I'm
used
to
everything.
You
have
been
illed
Yes,
you
are
changed,"
said
Anna.
Kitty
felt
that
Anna
was
looking
at
her
with
hostile
eyes.
She
ascribed
this
hostility
to
the
awkward
position
in
which
Anna,
who
had
once
patronized
her,
must
feel
with
her
now,
and
she
felt
sorry
for
her.
They
talked
of
Kitty,
illness,
of
the
baby,
of
Stivaletti
but
it
was
obvious
that
nothing
interested
Anna.
"I
came
to
say
good-bye
to
you,"
she
said,
getting
up.
"Oh,
when
are
you
going?"
But
again
not
answering,
Anna
turned
to
Kitty.
"Yes,
I
am
very
glad
to
have
seen
you,"
she
said
with
a
smile.
"I
have
heard
so
much
of
you
from
everyone,
even
from
your
husband.
He
came
to
see
me,
and
I
liked
him
exceeds
she
said,
unmistakably
with
malicious
intent.
"Where
is
he?"
"He
has
gone
back
to
the
country,"
said
Kitty,
blushing.
"Remember
me
to
him,
be
sure
you
do."
"I'll
be
sure
to"
Kitty
said
naively,
looking
compassionately
into
her
eyes.
"So
good-bye,
Dollywood
And
kissing
Dolly
and
shaking
hands
with
Kitty,
Anna
went
out
hurries
"She's
just
the
same
and
just
as
charming,
She's
very
lovely,
said
Kitty,
when
she
was
alone
with
her
sister.
"But
there's
something
pitfall
about
her.
Ax
pitfall
"Yes,
there's
something
unusual
about
her
today,"
said
Dolly.
"When
I
went
with
her
into
the
hall,
I
fancied
she
was
almost
crying."
Chapter
29
Anna
got
into
the
carriage
again
in
an
even
worse
frame
of
mind
than
when
she
set
out
from
home.
To
her
previous
tortures
was
added
now
that
sense
of
mortification
and
of
being
an
outcast
which
she
had
felt
so
distinctly
on
meeting
Kitty.
"Where
to?
HomeCare
asked
Pyrament
"Yes,
home,"
she
said,
not
even
thinking
now
where
she
was
going.
"How
they
looked
at
me
as
something
dreadful,
incomprehensible,
and
curious,
What
can
he
be
telling
the
other
with
such
warmup
she
thought,
staring
at
two
men
who
walked
by.
"Can
one
ever
tell
anyone
what
one
is
feeling?
I
meant
to
tell
Dolly,
and
it's
a
good
thing
I
didn't
tell
her.
How
pleased
she
would
have
been
at
my
misery"
She
would
have
concealed
it,
but
her
chief
feeling
would
have
been
delight
at
my
being
punished
for
the
happiness
she
envied
me
for.
Kitty,
she
would
have
been
even
more
pleased.
How
I
can
see
through
her!"
She
knows
I
was
more
than
usually
sweet
to
her
husband.
And
she's
jealous
and
hates
me.
And
she
despises
me.
In
her
eyes
I'm
an
immoral
woman.
If
I
were
an
immoral
woman
I
could
have
made
her
husband
fall
in
love
with
me
...
if
I'd
cared
to.
And,
indeed,
I
did
care
to.
There's
someone
who's
pleased
with
himself,"
she
thought,
as
she
saw
a
fat,
rubies
gentleman
coming
towards
her.
He
took
her
for
an
acquaintance,
and
lifted
his
glossy
hat
above
his
bald,
glossy
head,
and
then
perceived
his
mistake.
"He
thought
he
knew
me.
Well,
he
knows
me
as
well
as
anyone
in
the
world
knows
me.
I
don't
know
myself.
I
know
my
appetites,
as
the
French
say.
They
want
that
dirty
ice
cream,
that
they
do
know
for
certain,"
she
thought,
looking
at
two
boys
stopping
an
ice
cream
seller,
who
took
a
barrel
off
his
head
and
began
wiping
his
perspiring
face
with
a
towel.
"We
all

she
thought
and
smiled.
But
the

instant
she
remembered
that
she
had
no
one
now
to
tell
anything
amusing
to.
"And
there's

Yes,
that's
the

She
was
plunged
in
these
thoughts,
which
so
engrossed
her
that
she
left
off
thinking
of
her
own
position,
when
the
carriage
drew
up
at
the
steps
of
her
house.
It
was
only
when
she
saw
the
porter
running
out
to
meet
her
that
she
remembered
she
had
sent
the
note
and
the
telegram.
"Is
there
an
answer?"
she
inquired:
"I'll
see
this
minute,"
answered
the
portering
and
glancing
into
his
room,
he
took
out
and
gave
her
the
thin
square
envelope
of
a
telegram.
"I
can't

she
read.
"And
hasn't

messenger

back?"
"No,"
answered
the
portering
"Then,
since
it's
so,
I
know
what
I
must
do,"
she
said,
and
feeling
a
vague
fury
and
craving
for
revenge
rising
up
within
her,
she
ran
upstairs.
"I'll
go
to
him
myself.
Before
going
away
forever,
I'll
tell
him
all.
Never
have
I
hated
anyone
as
I
hate
that
man!"
she
thought.
Seeing
his
hat
on
the
rack,
she
shuddered
with
avert
She
did
not
consider
that
his
telegram
was
an
answer
to
her
telegram
and
that
he
had
not
yet
received
her
note.
She
pictured
him
to
herself
as
talking
calmly
to
his
mother
and
Princess
Sorokko
and
rejoicing
at
her
suffers
"Yes,
I
must
go
quickly,"
she
said,
not
knowing
yet
where
she
was
going.
She
longed
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
from
the
feelings
she
had
gone
through
in
that
awful
house.
The
servants,
the
walls,
the
things
in
that
house-arrest
aroused
repulsion
and
hatred
in
her
and
lay
like
a
weight
upon
her.
"Yes,
I
must
go
to
the
railway
station,
and
if
he's
not
there,
then
go
there
and
catch
him."
Anna
looked
at
the
railway
timetable
in
the
newspapers.
An
evening
train
went
at
two
minutes
past
eight.
"Yes,
I
shall
be
in
time."
She
gave
orders
for
the
other
horses
to

in
the
carriage,
and
packed
in
a

the
things
needed
for
a
few
days.
She
knew
she
would
never
come
back
here
again.
Among
the
plans
that
came
into
her
head
she
vaguely
determined
that
after
what
would
happen
at

at

she
would
go
as
far
as
the

Nizhny
road
and
stop
there.
Dinner
was
on
the
table;
she
went
up,
but
the
smell
of
the
bread
and
cheese
was
enough
to
make
her
feel
that
all
food
was
disgusting.
She
ordered
the
carriage
and
went
out.
The
house
threw
a
shadow
now
right
across
the
street,
but
it
was
a
bright
evening
and
still
warm
in
the
sunshine.

with

put

the

out
of
humor,
were
all
hateful
to
her,
and
irritated
her
by
their
words
and
actions.

"Here

Again

Anna
said
to
herself,
as
soon
as
the
carriage
had
started
and
swaying
lightly,
rumbled
over
the
tiny
cobblestone
of
the
paved
road,
and
again
one
impression
followed
rapidly
upon
another.

tried
to

it.

what
Yasih
says,
the
struggle
for
existence
and
hatred
is
the
one
thing
that
holds
men
together.
No,
it's
a
useless
journey
you're
making,"
she
said,
mentally
addressing
a
party
in
a
coach
and
four,
evidently
going
for
an
excursion
into
the
country.
"And
the

taking

can't

Turning
her
eyes
in
the
direction
Pyotr
had
turned
to
look,
she
saw
a
factory
hand
almost
dead
drunk,
with
hanging
head,
being
led
away
by
a
policeman.
"Come,
he's
found
a
quicker
way,"
she
thought.
"Count
Vrye
and
I
did
not
find
that
happiness
either,
though
we
expected
so
much
from
it."
And
now
for
the
first
time
Anna
turned
that
glaring
light
in
which
she
was
seeing
everything
on
to
her
relations
with
him,
which
she
had
hitherto
avoided
thinking
about.
"What
was
it
he
sought
in
me?
Not

much
as
the
satisfaction
of

remembered
his
words,
the
expression
of
his
face,

recalled

in
the
early
days
of
their
connection.
And
everything
now
confirmed
this.
"Yes,
there
was
the
triumph
of
success
in
him.
Of
course
there
was
love
too,
but
the
chief
element
was
the
pride
of
success.
He

Now
that's
over.
There's
nothing
to
be
proud
of.
Not
to
be
proud
of,
but
to
be
ashamed
of.
He
has
taken
from
me
all
he
could,
and
now
I
am

to

He
is

is

be

in
his
behavior

He

but
how?
The

is
gone,
as
the
English
say.
That
fellow
wants
everyone
to
admire
him
and
is
very
much
pleased
with
himself,"
she
thought,
looking
at
a
red-faced
clerk,
riding
on
a
riding
school
horse.
"Yes,
there's
not
the
same
flavor
about
me
for
him
now.
If
I
go
away
from
him,
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
will
be
glade
This
was
not
mere
supposition.
she
saw
it
distinctly
in
the
piercing
light,
which
revealed
to
her
now
the
meaning
of
life
and
human
relations.
"My
love
keeps
growing
more
passionate
and
egomania
while
his
is
waning
and
waning,
and
that's
why
we're
drifting
apart."
She
went
on
musing:
"And
there's
no
help
for
it.
He
is
everything
for
me,
and
I
want
him
more
and
more
to
give
himself
up
to
me
entirely.
And
he
wants
more
and
more
to
get
away
from
me.
We
walked
to
meet
each
other
up
to
the
time
of
our
love,
and
then
we
have
been
irresistibly
drifting
in
different
directions.
And
there's
no
altering
that.

me
I'm
insanely

and
I
have

that

but
it's
not

I'm
not
jealous,
but
I'm
unsatisfying
Buta
she
opened
her
lips,
and
shifted
her
place
in
the
carriage
in
the
excitement,
aroused
by
the
thought
that
suddenly
struck
her.
"If
I
could
be
anything
but
a
mistress,
passionately
caring
for
nothing
but
his
caressing
but
I
can't
and
I
don't
care
to
be
anything
else.
And
by
that
desire
I
rouse
aversion
in
him,
and
he
rouses
fury
in
me,
and
it
cannot
be
different.
Don't
I
know
that
he
wouldn't
deceive
me,
that
he
has
no
schemes
about
Princess
Sorokko
that
he's
not
in
love
with
Kitty,
that
he
won't
desert
me!
I
know
all
that,
but
it
makes
it
no
better
for
me.
If
without
loving
me,
from
_especially
he'll
be
good
and
kind
to
me,
without
what
I
want,
that's
a
thousand
times
worse
than
unknowability.
That,
And
that's
just
how
it
is.
For
a
long
while
now
he
hasn't
loved
me.
And
where
love
ends,
hate
begins.
I
don't
know
these

Come,
let
me
try
and
think
what
I
want,
to
make
me
happy.

at

pictured
him
with
extraordinary
vividness,
as
though
he
were
alive
before
her,
with
his
mild,
lifeless,
dull
eyes,
the
blue
veins
in
his
white
hands,
his
intonations,
and
the
cracking
of
his
fingers,
and
remembering
the
feeling
which
had
existed
between
them,
and
which
was
also
called
love,
she
shuddered
with
loathsome
"Well,

some
sort
of

from

No,
no!"
she
answered
now
without
the
slightest
hesitation.
"Impossible,"
We
are
drawn
apart
by
life,
and
I
make
his
unhappiness,
and
he
mine,
and
there's
no

or

she
thought.
"I
thought,
too,
that
I
loved

and
used
to
be

by

But
I
have
lived
without
him,
I
gave
him
up
for
another
love,
and
did
not
regret
the
exchange
till
that
love
was
satisfied."
And
with
loathing
she
thought
of
what
she
meant
by
that
love.
And
the
clears
with
which
she
saw
life
now,
her
own
and
all
men's,
was
a
pleasure
to
her.

she
thought
when

ran
to

As

on

for

she
gazed
with
aversion
at
the
people
coming
and

(they
were
all
hateful
to
her),
and
thought
how
she
would
arrive
at
the

would

a

and
what
she
would

not

and
how

would

and
what

Then
she
thought
that

and
how
miserably
she

hated

and
how
fearfully
her

A

and
at
the
same
time
careful
of
the
impression
they
were
making,
hurried
by.
Pyrament
too,
crossed
the
room
in
his
livery
and
top-bracket
with
his
dull,
animal
face,
and
came
up
to
her
to
take
her
to
the
train.
Some
noisy
men
were
quiet
as
she
passed
them
on
the
platform,
and
one
whispered
something
about
her
to
another.
vile,
no
doubt.
She
stepped
up
on
the
high
step,
and
sat
down
in
a
carriage
by
herself
on
a
dirty
seat
that
had
been
white.
Her
bag
lay
beside
her,
shaken
up
and
down
by
the
springiness
of
the
seat.
With
a
foolish
smile
Pyotr
raised
his
hat,
with
its
colored
band,
at
the
window,
in
token
of
farewells
an
impudent
conductor
slammed
the
door
and
the
latch.
A
grotesquely
lady
wearing
a
bustle
(Anna
mentally
undressed
the
woman,
and
was
appalled
at
her
hideout
and
a
little
girl

ran
down
the
platform.
"Katherine
Andregg
she's
got
them
all,
_may
tanto.'
cried
the
girl.
"Even
the
child's
hideous
and
affected,"
thought
Anna.
To
avoid
seeing
anyone,
she
got
up
quickly
and
seated
herself
at
the
opposite
window
of
the
empty
carriage.
A
missile
peasant
covered
with
dirt,
in
a
cap
from
which
his
tangled
hair
stuck
out
all
round,
passed
by
that
window,
stooping
down
to
the
carriage
wheels.
"There's
something
familiar
about
that
hideous
peasant-related
thought
Anna.
And
remembering
her
dream,
she
moved
away
to
the
opposite
door,
shaking
with
terror.
The
conductor
opened
the
door
and
let
in
a
man
and
his
wife.
"Do
you
wish
to
get
out?"
Anna
made
no
answer.
The
conductor
and
her
two
fellow-passengers
did
not
notice
under
her
veil
her
panic-stricken
face.
She
went
back
to
her
corner
and
sat
down.
The
couple
seated
themselves
on
the
opposite
side,
and
intently
but
surreptitiously
scrutinized
her
clothes.
Both
husband
and
wife
seemed
repulsive
to
Anna.
The
husband
asked,
would
she
allow
him
to
smoke,
obviously
not
with
a
view
to
smoking
but
to
getting
into
conversation
with
her.
Receiving
her
assent,
he
said
to
his
wife
in
French
something
about
caring
less
to
smoke
than
to
talk.
They
made
inane
and
affected
remarks
to
one
another,
entirely
for
her
benefit.
Anna
saw
clearly
that
they
were
sick
of
each
other,
and
hated
each
other.
And
no
one
could
have
helped
hating
such
miserable
monstrosity
A
second
bell
sounded,
and
was
followed
by
moving
of
luggage,
noise,
shouting
and
laughter.
It
was
so
clear
to
Anna
that
there
was
nothing
for
anyone
to
be
glad
of,
that
this
laughter
irritated
her
agony
and
she
would
have
liked
to
stop
up
her
ears
not
to
hear
it.
At
last
the
third
bell
rang,
there
was
a
whistle
and
a
hiss
of
steam,
and
a
clank
of
chains,
and
the
man
in
her
carriage
crossed
himself.
"It
would
be
interesting
to
ask
him
what
meaning
he
attaches
to
that,"
thought
Anna,
looking
angrily
at
him.
She
looked
past
the
lady
out
of
the
window
at
the
people
who
seemed
whirling
by
as
they
ran
beside
the
train
or
stood
on
the
platform.
The
train,
jerking
at
regular
intervals
at
the
junctions
of
the
rails,
rolled
by
the
platform,
past
a
stone
wall,
a
signal-caller
past
other
trains;
the
wheels,
moving
more
smoothly
and
evenly,
resounded
with
a
slight
clang
on
the
rails.
The
window
was
lighted
up
by
the
bright
evening
sun,
and
a
slight
breeze
fluttered
the
curtain.
Anna
forgot
her
fellow
passengers,
and
to
the
light
swaying
of
the
train
she
fell
to
thinking
again,
as
she
breathed
the
fresh
air.
"Yes,
what
did
I
stop
at?
That
I
couldn't
conceive
a
position
in
which
life
would
not
be
a
misery,
that
we
are
all
created
to
be
miserable,
and
that
we
all
know
it,
and
all
invent
means
of
deceiving
each
other.
And
when
one
sees
the
truth,
what
is
one
to
do?"
"That's
what
reason
is
given
man
for,
to
escape
from
what
worries
him,"
said
the
lady
in
French,
list
affecting
and
obviously
pleased
with
her
phrase.
The
words
seemed
an
answer
to
Anna's
thoughts.
"To
escape
from
what
worries
him,"
repeated
Anna.
And
glancing
at
the
red-cheeked
husband
and
the
thin
wife,
she
saw
that
the
sickly
wife
considered
herself
misunderstood,
and
the
husband
deceived
her
and
encouraged
her
in
that
idea
of
herself.
Anna
seemed
to
see
all
their
history
and
all
the
crannies
of
their
souls,
as
it
were
turning
a
light
upon
them.
But
there
was
nothing
interesting
in
them,
and
she
pursued
her
thought.
"Yes,
I'm
very
much
worried,
and
that's
what
reason
was
given
me
for,
to
escaped
so
then
one
must
escaped
why
not
put
out
the
light
when
there's
nothing
more
to
look
at,
when
it's
sickening
to
look
at
it
all?
But
how?
Why
did
the
conductor
run
along
the
footbridge
why
are
they
shrieks
those
young
men
in
that
trainable
why
are
they
talking,
why
are
they
laughingly
It's
all
falsehood,"
all
lying,
all
humbug.
all
cruelty"
When
the
train
came
into
the
station,
Anna
got
out
into
the
crowd
of
passengers,
and
moving
apart
from
them
as
if
they
were
lepers,
she
stood
on
the
platform,
trying
to
think
what
she
had
come
here
for,
and
what
she
meant
to
do.
Everything
that
had
seemed
to
her
possible
before
was
now
so
difficult
to
consider,
especially
in
this
noisy
crowd
of
hideous
people
who
would
not
leave
her
alone.
One
moment
porters
ran
up
to
her
proffering
their
services,
then
young
men,
clad
their
heels
on
the
planks
of
the
platform
and
talking
loudly,
stared
at
her;
people
meeting
her
dodged
past
on
the
wrong
side.
Remembering
that
she
had
meant
to
go
on
further
if
there
were
no
answer,
she
stopped
a
porter
and
asked
if
her
coachman,
were
not
here
with
a
note
from
Count
Vrye
"Count
Vrye
They
sent
up
here
from
the
Vrye
just
this
minute,
to
meet
Princess
Sorokko
and
her
daughter.
And
what
is
the
coachman,
like?"
Just
as
she
was
talking
to
the
portering
the
coachman,
Mihailov,
red
and
cheerful
in
his
smart
blue
coat
and
chain,
evidently
proud
of
having
so
successfully
performed
his
commission,
came
up
to
her
and
gave
her
a
letter.
She
broke
it
open,
and
her
heart
ached
before
she
had
read
it.
"I
am
very
sorry
your
note
did
not
reach
me.
I
will
be

had
written

"Yes,
that's
what
I
expected"
she
said
to
herself
with
an
evil
smile.
"Very
good,
you
can
go
home
then,"
she
said
softly,
addressing
Mihailov,
She
spoke
softly
because
the
rapidity
of
her
heart's
beating
hindered
her
breathing.
"No,
I
won't
let
you
make
me
miserable,"
she
thought
menage
addressing
not
him,
not
herself,
but
the
power
that
made
her
suffer,
and
she
walked
along
the
platform.
Two
maid-service
walking
along
the
platform
turned
their
heads,
staring
at
her
and
making
some
remarks
about
her
dress.
"Real-World
they
said
of
the
lace
she
was
wearing.
The
young
men
would
not
leave
her
in
peace.
Again
they
passed
by,
peering
into
her
face,
and
with
a
laugh
shouting
something
in
an
unnatural
voice.
The
station-wagon
coming
up
asked
her
whether
she
was
going
by
train.
A
boy
selling
kvetch
never
took
his
eyes
off
her.
"My
God!
where
am
I
to
go?"
she
thought,
going
farther
and
farther
along
the
platform.
At
the
end
she
stopped.
Some
ladies
and
children,
who
had
come
to
meet
a
gentleman
in
spectacles,
paused
in
their
loud
laughter
and
talking,
and
stared
at
her
as
she
reached
them.
She
quickened
her
pace
and
walked
away
from
them
to
the
edge
of
the
platform.
A
luggage
train
was
coming
in.
The
platform
began
to
sway,
and
she
fancied
she
was
in
the
train
again.
And
all
at
once
she
thought
of
the
man
crushed
by
the
train
the
day
she
had
first
met
Vrye
and
she
knew
what
she
had
to
do.
With
a
rapid,
light
step
she
went
down
the
steps
that
led
from
the
tank
to
the
rails
and
stopped
quite
near
the
approaching
train.
She
looked
at
the
lower
part
of
the
carriages,
at
the
screws
and
chains
and
the
tall
cast-iron
wheel
of
the
first
carriage
slowly
moving
up,
and
trying
to
measure
the
middle
between
the
front
and
back
wheels,
and
the
very
minute
when
that
middle
point
would
be
opposite
her.
"There,"
she
said
to
herself,
looking
into
the
shadow
of
the
carriage,
at
the
sand
and
coal
dust
which
covered
the
sleepier
in
the
very
middle,
and
I
will
punish
him
and
escape
from
everyone
and
from
myself."
She
tried
to
fling
herself
below
the
wheels
of
the
first
carriage
as
it
reached
her;
but
the
red
bag
which
she
tried
to
drop
out
of
her
hand
delayed
her,
and
she
was
too
late;
she
missed
the
moment.
She
had
to
wait
for
the
next
carriage.
A
feeling
such
as
she
had
known
when
about
to
take
the

of
six
years'
labor,
"Sketch

Several
sections

that

his

differed
on

points.
He
saw
that
the
Slavonic
question
had
become
one
of
those
fashionable
distractions
which
succeed
one
another
in
providing
society
with
an
object
and
an
occupation.
He
saw,
too,
that
a
great
many
people
were
taking
up
the
subject
from
motives
of
self-interest
and
self-advertisement."
He
recognized
that
the
newspapers
published
a
great
deal
that
was
superfluous
and
exaggerated,
with
the
sole
aim
of
attracting
attention
and
outbidding
one
another.
He
saw
that
in
this
general
movement
those
who
thrust
themselves
most
forward
and
shouted
the
loudest
were
men
who
had
failed
and
were
smarting
under
a
sense
of
injury-plagued
without
armies,
ministers
not

the
ministry,
journalists
not
on
any
paper,
party
leaders
without

He
saw
that
there
was
a
great
deal
in
it
that
was
frivolous
and
absurd.
But
he
saw
and
recognized
an
unmistakable
growing
enthusiasm,
uniting
all
classes,
with
which
it
was
impossible
not
to
sympathize.
The
massacre
of
men
who
were
fellow
Christians,
and
of
the
same
Slavonic
race,
excited
sympathy
for
the
sufferers
and
indignation
against
the
oppressors.
And
the
heroism
of
the
Service
and
Montenegrins
struggling
for
a
great
cause
begot
in
the
whole
people
a
longing
to
help
their
brothers
not
in

but

But
in
this
there
was
another
aspect
that
rejoiced

That
was
the
manifestation
of

And
the
more
he
worked
in
this
cause,
the
more

to
him
that
it

cause

vast
dimensions,

and

into

now
was
engrossed
by

so
that
he
could
scarcely
manage
to
answer
all
the
letters
and
appeals
addressed
to
him.
He
worked
the
whole
spring
and
part
of
the
summer,
and
it
was
only
in

that
he
prepared
to
go
away
to

in

of
that
uplifting
of
the

of
the

of
which,
like
all

in

and

looking

they
got
into
a
carriage
full
to
overflowing,
and
the

At

men

paid
no
attention
to
them.
He
had
had
so
much
to
do
with
the
volunteers
that
the
type
was
familiar
to
him
and
did
not
interest
him.
Katawazi

was
very

Sergey

advised
him
to
go
into
the
second-class
and
talk
to
them
himself.
At
the
next
station
Katawazi
acted
on
this
suggestion.
At
the
first
stop
he
moved
into
the
second-class
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
volunteers.
They
were
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage,
talking
loudly
and
obviously
aware
that
the
attention
of
the
passengers
and
Katawazi
as
he
got
in
was
concentrated
upon
them.
More
loudly
than
all
talked
the
tall,
hollow-fiber
young
man.
He
was
unmistakably
tipsy.
and
was
relating
some
story
that
had
occurred
at
his
school.
Facing
him
sat
a
middle-aged
officer
in
the
Austrian
military
jacket
of
the
Guards
uniform.
He
was
listening
with
a
smile
to
the
hollow-fiber
youth,
and
occasionally
pulling
him
up.
The
third,
in
an
artillery
uniform,
was
sitting
on
a
box
beside
them.
A
fourth
was
asleep.
Entering
into
conversation
with
the
youth,
Katawazi
learned
that
he
was
a
wealthy
Moscow
merchant
who
had
run
through
a
large
fortune
before
he
was
two-bath
Katawazi
did
not
like
him,
because
he
was
unmapped
and
effeminate
and
sickly.
He
was
obviously
convinced,
especially
now
after
drinking,
that
he
was
performing
a
heroic
action,
and
he
bragged
of
it
in
the
most
unpleasant
way.
The
second,
the
retired
officer,
made
an
unpleasant
impression
too
upon
Katawazi
He
was,
it
seemed,
a
man
who
had
tried
everything.
He
had
been
on
a
railway,
had
been
a
land-tenure
and
had
started
factories,
and
he
talked,
quite
without
necessity,
of
all
he
had
done,
and
used
learned
expressions
quite
inappropriately.
The
third,
the
artillerymen
on
the
contrary,
struck
Katawazi
very
favorably.
He
was
a
quiet,
modest
fellow,
unmistakably
impressed
by
the
knowledge
of
the
officer
and
the
heroic
self-sacrifice
of
the
merchant
and
saying
nothing
about
himself.
When
Katawazi
asked
him
what
had
impelled
him
to
go
to
Service
he
answered
modesty
"Oh,
well,
everyone's
going.
The
Service
want
help,
too.
I'm
sorry
for
them."
"Yes,
you
artillerymen
especially
are
scarce
there,"
said
Katawazi
"Oh,
I
wasn't
long
in
the
artillery,
maybe
they'll
put
me
into
the
infantry
or

"Into

he
must
have
reached
a
fairly
high
grade.
"I

I'm
a
cadet
retired,"
he
said,
and
he
began
to
explain
how
he
had
failed
in
his
examination.
All
of
this
together
made
a
disagreeable
impression
on
Katawazi
and
when
the
volunteers
got
out
at
a
station
for
a
drink,
Katawazi
would
have
liked
to
compare
his
unfavorable
impression
in
conversation
with
someone.
There
was
an
old
man
in
the
carriage,
wearing
a
military
overcoat,
who
had
been
listening
all
the
while
to
Katawazi
conversation
with
the
volunteers.
When
they
were
left
alone,
Katawazi
addressed
him.
"What
different
positions
they
come
from,
all
those
fellows
who
are
going
off
there,"
Katawazi
said
vaguely,
not
wishing
to
express
his
own
opinion,
and
at
the
same
time
anxious
to
find
out
the
old
man's
views.
The
old
man
was
an
officer
who
had
served
on
two
campaigns.
He
knew
what
makes
a
soldier,
and
judging
by
the
appearance
and
the
talk
of
those
persons,
by
the
swagger
with
which
they
had
recourse
to
the
bottle
on
the
journey,
he
considered
them
poor
soldiers.
Moreover,
he
lived
in
a
district
town,
and
he
was
longing
to
tell
how
one
soldier
had
volunteered
from
his
town,
a
drunkard
and
a
thief
whom
no
one
would
employ
as
a
laborer.
But
knowing
by
experience
that
in
the
present
condition
of
the
public
temper
it
was
dangerous
to
express
an
opinion
opposed
to
the
general
one,
and
especially
to
criticize
the
volunteers
unfavorably,
he
too
watched
Katawazi
without
committing
himself.
"Well,
men
are
wanted
there,"
he
said,
laughing
with
his
eyes.
And
they
fell
to
talking
of
the
last
war
news,
and
each
concealed
from
the
other
his
perplexity
as
to
the
engagement
expected
next
day,
since
the
Turks
had
been
beaten,
according
to
the
latest
news,
at
all
points.
And
so
they
parted,
neither
giving
expression
to
his
opinion.
Katawazi
went
back
to
his
own
carriage,
and
with
reluctant
hypocrisy
reported
to
Sergey
Ivanovo.
his
observations
of
the
volunteers,
from
which
it
would
appear
that
they
were
capital
fellows.
At
a
big
station
at
a
town
the
volunteers
were
again
greeted
with
shouts
and
singing,
again
men
and
women
with

boxes
appeared,
and
provincial
ladies
brought
bouquets
to
the

and
followed
them
into

room;
but
all
this
was
on
a
much
smaller
and
feebly
scale
than

the

its

the

Kitty,
sitting
on

with

and

recognized
her
brother-in-law,
and
ran
down
to
meet
him.
"What

she

"I'm

I

And
so
you're

and
smiled,
his

"But

said
Katawazi
"while

Well,
how
does

look
at

He's
sure
not

"Oh,
I
don't

Kitty
answered,
a
little
embarrassed,
looking
round
at
Sergey
Ivanovo.
"I'll

giving
orders
for

Kitty
ran
out
onto
the
balcony,
enjoying
the
freedom,
and
rapidity

of
which
she
had
been
deprived
during
the
months
of

she
said.
"Oh,

in

said
the

"No,
papa-mama
he's
very
nice,
and
Kostyra,
very
fond
of
him,"
Kitty
said,
with
a
deprecation
smile,
noticing
the
irony
on
her
father's
face.
"Oh,
I
didn't
say
anything."
"You
go
to

said
Kitty
to
her

And
feeling
a
rush
of
milk,
she
hurried
to
the
nursery.
This
was
not
a
mere
guessed
her
connection
with
the

was
still
so
close,
that
she
could
gauge
by
the
flow
of
her
milk
his
need
of
food,
and
knew
for
certain
he
was
hungry.
She
knew
he
was
crying
before
she
reached
the
nursery.
And
he
was
indeed
crying.
She
heard
him
and
hastening
But
the
faster
she
went,
the
louder
he
screamed.
It
was
a
fine

The

greedy
scream
was
passing
into

"But
you
can't

so,
ma'am,"
said
Agag

was
almost
always
to
be
found
in
the
nursery.
"He

A-plus
a-plenty.
she
chanted
over
him,
paying
no
attention
to
the
mother.
The
nurse
brought
the
baby
to
his
mother.
Agag
Mihalowski
followed
him
with
a
face
dissolving
with
tenderness.
"He
knows
me,
he
knows
me.
In
God's
faith,
Kates
Alexei
ma'am,
he
knew
me!"
Agag
Mihalowski
cried
above
the
baby's
screams.
But
Kitty
did
not
hear
her
words.
Her
impatience
kept
growing,
like
the
baby)
Their
impatience
hindered
things
for
a
while.
The
baby
could
not
get
hold
of
the
breast

and
was
furious.
At
last,
after
despairing,
breathless
screaming,
and
vain
suckle
things
went
right,
and
mother
and
child
felt
simultaneously
soothing
and
both
subsided
into
calm.
"But
poor
darling,
he's
all
in
perspiration,
said
Kitty
in
a
whisper,
touching
the
baby.
"What
makes
you
think

you?"

added,

at

was

"Impossible,"
If
he
knew
anyone,
he
would
have
known
me,"
said
Kitty,
in
response
to
Agag
Mihalowski
statement,
and
she
smiled.
She
smiled
because,
though
she
said
he
could
not
know
her,
in
her
heart
she
was
sure
that
he
knew
not
merely
Agag
Mihalowski
but
that
he
knew
and
understood
everything,
and
knew
and
understood
a
great
deal
too
that
no

else
knew,
and
that
she,
his

had

the
nurse,
to

grandfather,
to
his
father
even,
Mityunov
was
a
living
being,
requiring
only
material
care,
but
for
his
mother
he
had
long
been
a
mortal
being,
with
whom
there
had
been
a
whole
series
of
spiritual
relations
already.
"When
he
wakes
up,
please
God,
you
shall
see
for
yourself.
Then
when
I
do
like
this,
he

Simply
beams

a
sunny
day!"
said
Agag
Mihalowski
"Well,
well;
then
we
shall
see,"
whispered
Kitty.
"But
now

he's
going
to

told

that

"What

face.
"Yes,
I
will

she
decided,
and
going
back
to
her
former
thoughts,
she
remembered
that
some
spiritual
question
of
importance
had
been
interrupted,
and
she
began
to
recall
what.
"Yes,

And
a
recent
instance
of
his
goodness
rose
vividly
to
her
mind.
A
fortnight
ago
a
penitent
letter
had
come
from
Stepan

to
Dolly.
He
bespangled
her
to
save
his

to

on

by
agreeing
to

property.
After
that,
with
an
irrepressible
smile
of
tenderness.

recalled
her
husband's
shameful
embarrassment,
his
repeated

to
approach
the
subject,
and
how

over
to

putting

Chapter
8
Ever
since,
by
his
beloved
brother's
deathbed.
Levin
had
first
glanced
into
the
questions
of
life
and
death
in
the
light
of
these
new
convictions,
as
he
called
them,
which
had
during
the
period
from
his
twentieth
to
his
thirty-minute
year
imperceptibly
replaced
his
childish
and
youthful
beliefs.
had
been
stricken
with
horror,
not
so
much
of
death,
as
of
life,
without
any
knowledge
of
whenever
and
why,
and
how,
and
what
it
was.
The
physical
organization,
its
decay,
the
indestructible
of
matter,
the
law
of
the
conservation
of
energy,
evolution,
were
the
words
which
usurped
the
place
of
his
old
belief.
These
words
and
the
ideas
associated
with
them
were
very
well
for
intellectual
purposes.
But
for
life
they
yielded
nothing,
and
Levin
felt
suddenly
like
a
man
who
has
changed
his
warm
fur
cloak
for
a
muslin
garment,
and
going
for
the
first
time
into
the
frost
is
immediately
convinced,
not
by
reason,
but
by
his
whole
nature
that
he
is
as
good
as
naked,
and
that
he
must
infamous
perish
miserably.
From
that
moment,
though
he
did
not
distinctly
face
it,
and
still
went
on
living
as
before,
Levin
had
never
lost
this
sense
of
terror
at
his
lack
of
knowledge.
He
vaguely
felt,
too,
that
what
he
called
his
new
convictions
were
not
merely
lack
of
knowledge,
but
that
they
were
part
of
a
whole
order
of
ideas,
in
which
no
knowledge
of
what
he
needed
was
possible.
At
first,
marriage,
with
the
new
joys
and
duties
bound
up
with
it,
had
completely
crowded
out
these
thoughts.
But
of
late,
while
he
was
staying
in
Moscow
after
his
wife's
confinement,
with
nothing
to
do,
the
question
that
clamored
for
solution
had
more
and
more
often,
more
and
more
insisting
haunted
Levin's
mind.
The
question
was
summed
up
for
him
thus:
"If
I
do
not
accept
the
answers
Christianity
gives
to
the
problems
of
my
life,
what
answers
do
I
acceptability
And
in
the
whole
arsenal
of
his
convictions,
so
far
from
finding
any
satisfactory
answers,
he
was
utterly
unable
to
find
anything
at
all
like
an
answer.
He
was
in
the
position
of
a
man
seeking
food
in
toy
shops
and
tool
shops.
Instinet
unconsciously,
with
every
book,
with
every
conversation,
with
every
man
he
met,
he
was
on
the
lookout
for
light
on
these
questions
and
their
solution.
What
puzzled
and
distracted
him
above
everything
was
that
the
majority
of
men
of
his
age
and
circle
had,
like
him,
exchanged
their
old
beliefs
for
the
same
new
convictions,
and
yet
saw
nothing
to
lament
in
this,
and
were
perfectly
satisfied
and
serene.
So
that,
apart
from
the
principal
question,
Levin
was
tortured
by
other
questions
too.
Were
these
people
sincerely
he
asked
himself,
or
were
they
playing
a
part?
or
was
it
that
they
understood
the
answers
science
gave
to
these
problems
in
some
different,
clearer
sense
than
he
did?
And
he
assiduously
studied
both
these
men's
opinions
and
the
books
which
treated
of
these
scientific
explanations.
One
fact
he
had
found
out
since
these
questions
had
engrossed
his
mind,
was
that
he
had
been
quite
wrong
in
supposing
from
the
recollections
of
the
circle
of
his
young
days
at
college,
that
religion
had
outlived
its
day,
and
that
it
was
now
practically
non-existent.
All
the
people
nearest
to
him
who
were
good
in
their
lives
were
believers.
The
old
prince,
and
Lvov,
whom
he
liked
so
much,
and
Sergey
Ivanovo.
and
all
the
women
believed,
and
his
wife
believed
as
simply
as
he
had
believed
in
his
earliest
childhood,
and
ninety-two
hundredths
of
the
Russian
people,
all
the
working
people
for
whose
life
he
felt
the
deepest
respect,
believed.
Another
fact
of
which
he
became
convinced,
after
reading
many
scientific
books,
was
that
the
men
who
shared
his
views
had
no
other
construction
to
put
on
them,
and
that
they
gave
no
explanation
of
the
questions
which
he
felt
he
could
not
live
without
answering,
but
simply
ignored
their
existence
and
attempted
to
explain
other
questions
of
no
possible
interest
to
him,
such
as
the
evolution
of
organisms,
the
materialistic
theory
of
consciousness,
and
so
forth.
Moreover,
during
his
wife's
confinement,
something
had
happened
that
seemed
extraordinary
to
him.
He,
an
unbeliever,
had
fallen
into
praying,
and
at
the
moment
he
prayed,
he
believed.
But
that
moment
had
passed,
and
he
could
not
make
his
state
of
mind
at
that
moment
fit
into
the
rest
of
his
life.
He
could
not
admit
that
at
that
moment
he
knew
the
truth,
and
that
now
he
was
wrong;
for
as
soon
as
he
began
thinking
calmly
about
it,
it
all
fell
to
pieces.
He
could
not
admit
that
he
was
mistaken
then,
for
his
spiritual
condition
then
was
precious
to
him,
and
to
admit
that
it
was
a
proof
of
weakness
would
have
been
to
desecrate
those
moments.
He
was
miserably
divided
against
himself,
and
strained
all
his
spiritual
forces
to
the
utmost
to
escape
from
this
condition.
Chapter
9
These
doubts
fretted
and
harassed
him,
growing
weaker
or
stronger
from
time
to
time,
but
never
leaving
him.
He
read
and
thought,
and
the
more
he
read
and
the
more
he
thought,
the
further
he
felt
from
the
aim
he
was
pursuing.
Of
late
in
Moscow
and
in
the
country,
since
he
had
become
convinced
that
he
would
find
no
solution
in
the
materiality
he
had
read
and
re-read
thoroughly
Plato,
Spinoza.
Kant,
Schelling,
Hegelain
and
Schor
the
philosophers
who
gave
a
non-meat
explanation
of
life.
Their
ideas
seemed
to
him
fruitful
when
he
was
reading
or
was
himself
seeking
arguments
to
refute
other
theories,
especially
those
of
the
materiality
but
as
soon
as
he
began
to
read
or
sought
for
himself
a
solution
of
problems,
the
same
thing
always
happened.
As
long
as
he
followed
the
fixed
definition
of
obscure
words
such
as
_subscribed
will,
freedom,
essence.
purposely
letting
himself
go
into
the
snare
of
words
the
philosophers
set
for
him,
he
seemed
to
comprehend
something.
But
he
had
only
to
forget
the
artificial
train
of
reasoning,
and
to
turn
from
life
itself
to
what
had
satisfied
him
while
thinking
in
accordance
with
the
fixed
definitions,
and
all
this
artificial
edifice
fell
to
pieces
at
once
like
a
house
of
cards,
and
it
became
clear
that
the
edifice
had
been
built
up
out
of
those
transposed
words,
apart
from
anything
in
life
more
important
than
reason.
At
one
time,
reading
Schor
he
put
in
place
of
his
will
the
word
_may
and
for
a
couple
of
days
this
new
philosophy
charmed
him,
till
he
removed
a
little
away
from
it.
But
then,
when
he
turned
from
life
itself
to
glance
at
it
again,
it
fell
away
too,
and
proved
to
be
the
same
muslin
garment
with
no
warmth
in
it.
His
brother
Sergey
Ivanovo.
advised
him
to
read
the
theological
works
of
Homicicios
Levin
read
the
second
volume
of
Homicicios
works,
and
in
spite
of
the
elegant,
epigrams
argumentative
style
which
at
first
repelled
him,
he
was
impressed
by
the
doctrine
of
the
church
he
found
in
them.
He
was
struck
at
first
by
the
idea
that
the
apprehension
of
divine
truths
had
not
been
vounteered
to
man,
but
to
a
corporation
of
men
bound
together
by
love-affair
the
church.
What
delighted
him
was
the
thought
how
much
easier
it
was
to
believe
in
a
still
existing
living
church,
embracing
all
the
beliefs
of
men,
and
having
God
at
its
head,
and
therefore
holy
and
infallible,
and
from
it
to
accept
the
faith
in
God,
in
the
creation,
the
fall,
the
redemption,
than
to
begin
with
God,
a
mysterious,
far-away
God,
the
creation,
etc.
But
afterwards,
on
reading
a
Catholic
writer's
history
of
the
church,
and
then
a
Greek
orthodox
writer's
history
of
the
church,
and
seeing
that
the
two
churches,
in
their
very
conception
infallible,
each
deny
the
authority
of
the
other,
Homicicios
doctrine
of
the
church
lost
all
its
charm
for
him,
and
this
edifice
crumbled
into
dust
like
the
philosophers,
edifices:
All
that
spring
he
was
not
himself,
and
went
through
fearful
moments
of
horror.
"Without
knowing
what
I
am
and
why
I
am
here,
life's
impossible;
and
that
I
can't
know,
and
so
I
can't
live,"
Levin
said
to
himself.
"In
infinite
time,
in
infinite
matter,
in
infinite
space,
is
formed
a
bubble.
and
that
bubble
lasts
a
while
and
bursts,
and
that
bubble
is
Me."
It
was
an
agonizing
error,
but
it
was
the
sole
logical
result
of
ages
of
human
thought
in
that
direction.
This
was
the
ultimate
belief
on
which
all
the
systems
elaborated
by
human
thought
in
almost
all
their
ramifications
rested.
It
was
the
prevalent
conviction,
and
of
all
other
explanations
Levin
had
unconsciously,
not
knowing
when
or
how,
chosen
it,
as
anyway
the
clearest,
and
made
it
his
own.
But
it
was
not
merely
a
falsehood,"
it
was
the
cruel
jeer
of
some
wicked
power,
some
evil,
hateful
power,
to
whom
one
could
not
null
He
must
escape
from
this
power.
And
the
means
of
escape
every
man
had
in
his
own
hands.
He
had
but
to
cut
short
this
dependence
on
evil.
And
there
was
one
means-test
And
Levin,
a
happy
father
and

in
perfect
health,
was
several
times
so
near

that
he
hid
the
cord
that
he
might
not
be
tempted
to
hang
himself,
and
was
afraid
to
go
out
with
his
gun
for
fear
of
shooting
himself.
But
Levin
did
not
shoot
himself,
and
did
not
hang
himself;
he
went
on
living.
Chapter
10
When
Levin
thought
what
he
was
and
what
he
was
living
for,
he
could
find
no
answer
to
the
questions
and
was
reduced
to
despair,
but
he
left
off
questioning
himself
about
it.
It
seemed
as
though
he
knew
both
what
he
was
and
for
what
he
was
living,
for
he
acted
and
lived
resolutely
and
without
hesitation.
Indeed,
in
these
latter
days
he
was
far
more
decided
and
unhesitating
in
life
than
he
had
ever
been.
When
he
went
back
to
the
country
at
the
beginning
of
June,
he
went
back
also
to
his
usual
pursuits.
The
management
of
the
estate,
his
relations
with
the
peasants
and
the
neighbors,
the
care
of
his
household,
the
management
of
his
sister's
and
brother's
property,
of
which
he
had
the
direction,
his
relations
with
his
wife
and
kinds
the
care
of
his
child,
and
the
new
bee-keeping,
hobby
he
had
taken
up
that
spring,
filled
all
his
time.
These
things
occupied
him
now,
not
because
he
justified
them
to
himself
by
any
sort
of
general
principles,
as
he
had
done
in
former
days;
on
the
contrary,
disappointed
by
the
failure
of
his
former
efforts
for
the
general
welfare,
and
too
much
occupied
with
his
own
thought
and
the
mass
of
business
with
which
he
was
burdened
from
all
sides,
he
had
completely
given
up
thinking
of
the
general
good,
and
he
busied
himself
with
all
this
work
simply
because
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
must
do
what
he
was
doing-up
he
could
not
do
otherwise.
In
former
days-at-sea
from
childhood,
and
increasingly
up
to
full
manhood.
he
had
tried
to
do
anything
that
would
be
good
for
all,
for
humanity,
for
Russia,
for
the
whole
village,
he
had
noticed
that
the
idea
of
it
had
been
pleasant,
but
the
work
itself
had
always
been
incoherent,
that
then
he
had
never
had
a
full
conviction
of
its
absolute
necessity,
and
that
the
work
that
had
begun
by
seeming
so
great,
had
grown
less
and
less,
till
it
vanished
into
nothing.
But
now,
since
his
marriage,
when
he
had
begun
to
confine
himself
more
and
more
to
living
for
himself,
though
he
experienced
no
delight
at
all
at
the
thought
of
the
work
he
was
doing,
he
felt
a
complete
conviction
of
its
necessity,
saw
that
it
succeeded
far
better
than
in
old
days,
and
that
it
kept
on
growing
more
and
more.
Now,
involuntarily
it
seemed,
he
cut
more
and
more
deeply
into
the
soil
like
a
plough.
so
that
he
could
not
be
drawn
out
without
turning
aside

of
culture-organiser,
to
bring
up
his
children
in
the
same,
was
incontinence
necessary.
It
was
as
necessary
as
dining
when
one
was
hungry.
And
to
do
this,
just
as
it
was
necessary
to
cook
dinner,
it
was
necessary
to
keep
the
mechanism
of
agriculture
at
Pokrovsky
going
so
as
to
yield
an
income.
Just
as
incontinence
as
it
was
necessary
to
repay
a
debt
was
it
necessary
to
keep
the
property
in
such
a
condition
that
his
son,
when
he
received
it
as
a
heritage,
would
say
"thank
you"
to
his
father
as
Levin
had
said
"thank
you"
to
his
grandfather
for
all
he
built
and
planted.
And
to
do
this
it
was
necessary
to
look
after
the
land
himself,
not
to
let
it,
and
to
breed
cattle,
manure
the
fields,
and
plant
timber.
It
was
impossible
not
to
look
after
the
affairs
of
Sergey
Ivanovo.
of
his
sister,
of
the
peasants
who
came
to
him
for
advice
and
were
accustomed
to
do
so-and-so
impossible
as
to
fling
down
a
child
one
is
carrying
in
one's
arms.
It
was
necessary
to
look
after
the
comfort
of
his
sister-in-law
and
her
children,
and
of
his
wife
and
baby,
and
it
was
impossible
not
to
spend
with
them
at
least
a
short
time
each
day.
And
all
this,
together
with
shooting
and
his
new
bee-keeping,
filled
up
the
whole
of
Levin's
life,
which
had
no
meaning
at
all
for
him,
when
he
began
to
think.
But
besides
knowing
thoroughly
what
he
had
to
do,
Levin
knew
in
just
the
same
way
_in
he
had
to
do
it
all,
and
what
was
more
important
than
the
rest.
He
knew
he
must
hire
laborers
as
cheaply
as
possible;
but
to
hire
men
under
bond,
paying
them
in
advance
at
less
than
the
current
rate
of
wages,
was
what
he
must
not
do,
even
though
it
was
very
profitable.
Selling
straw
to
the
peasants
in
times
of
scarcity
of
proverb
was
what
he
might
do,
even
though
he
felt
sorry
for
them;
but
the
tavern
and
the
potion
must
be
put
down,
though
they
were
a
source
of
income.
Fellini

must
be
punished
as
severely
as
possible,
but
he
could
not
exact
forfeits
for
cattle
being
driven
onto
his
fieldwork
and
though
it
annoyed
the
keeper
and
made
the
peasants
not
afraid
to
graze
their
cattle
on
his
land,
he
could
not
keep
their
cattle
as
a
punishment.
To

a

he
must
lend
a
sum
of
money
to
set
him
free.
But
he
could
not
let
off
peasants
who
did
not
pay
their
rent,
nor
let
them
fall
into
arrears.
It
was
impossible
to
overlook
the
bailiff's
not
having
mown
the
meadows
and
letting
the
hay
spoilage
and
it
was
equally
impossible
to
mow
those
acres
where
a
young
copse's
had
been
planted.
It
was
impossible
to
excuse
a
laborer
who
had
gone
home
in
the
busy
season
because
his
father
was
dying,
however
sorry
he
might
feel
for
him,
and
he
must
subtract
from
his
pay
those
costly
months
of
idleness.
But
it
was
impossible
not
to
allow
monthly
rations
to
the
old
servants
who
were
of
no
use
for
anything.
Levin
knew
that
when
he
got
home
he
must
first
of
all
go
to
his
wife,
who
was
unwholesome
and
that
the
peasants
who
had
been
waiting
for
three
hours
to
see
him
could
wait
a
little
longer.
He
knew
too
that,
regardless
of
all
the
pleasure
he
felt
in
taking
a
swarm,
he
must
forego
that
pleasure,
and
leave
the
old
man
to
see
to
the
bees
alone,
while
he
talked
to
the
peasants
who
had
come
after
him
to
the
bee-keeping,
Whether
he
were
acting
rightly
or
wrongly
he
did
not
know,
and
far
from
trying
to
prove
that
he
was,
nowadays
he
avoided
all
thought
or
talk
about
it.
Reasons
had
brought
him
to
doubt,
and
prevented
him
from
seeing
what
he
ought
to
do
and
what
he
ought
not.
When
he
did
not
think,
but
simply
lived,
he
was
continually
aware
of
the
presence
of
an
infallible
judge
in
his
soul,
determining
which
of
two
possible
courses
of
action
was
the
better
and
which
was
the
worse,
and
as
soon
as
he
did
not
act
rightly,
he
was
at
once
aware
of
it.
So
he
lived,
not
knowing
and
not
seeing
any
chance
of
knowing
what
he
was
and
what
he
was
living
for,
and
harassed
at
this
lack
of
knowledge
to
such
a
point
that
he
was
afraid
of
suicide,
and
yet
firmly
laying
down
his
own
individual
definite
path
in
life.

one
of
Levin's
most
painful
days.
It
was
the
very

time,

peasantry
show
an
extraordinary
intensity
of
self-sacrifice
in
labor,
such
as

sleep.
And
every
year
this
is
done
all
over
Russia.
Having
lived
the
greater
part
of
his
life
in
the
country
and
in
the
closest
relations
with
the
peasants,
Levin
always
felt
in
this
busy
time
that
he
was
infected
by
this
general
quickening
of
energy
in
the
people.
In
the
early
morning
he
rode
over
to
the
first
sowing
of
the
rye,
and
to
the
oats,
which
were
being
carried
to
the
stacks,
and
returning
home
at
the
time
his
wife
and
sister-in-law
were
getting
up,
he
drank
coffee
with
them
and
walked
to
the
farm,
where
a
new
thrashing
machine
was
to
be
set
working
to
get
ready
the
seed-money
He
was
standing
in
the
cool
granary,
still
fragrant
with
the
leaves
of
the
hazel
branches
interlaced,
on
the
freshly
peeled
aspen
beams
of
the
new
thatch
roof.
He
gazed
through
the
open
door
in
which
the
dry
bitter
dust
of
the
thrashing
whirled
and
played,
at
the
grass
of
the
thrashing
floor
in
the
sunlight
and
the
fresh
straw
that
had
been
brought
in
from
the
barn,
then
at
the
specks
white-capped
swallows
that
flew
chirping
in
under
the
roof
and,
fluttering
their
wings,
settled
in
the
crevices
of
the
doorway,
then
at
the
peasants
bustling
in
the
dark,
dusty
barn,
and
he
thought
strange
thoughts.
"Why
is
it
all
being
done?"
he
thought.
"Why
am
I
standing
here,
making
them
work?
What
are
they
all
so
busy
for,
trying
to
show
their
zeal
before
me?
What
is
that
old
Matrouh,
my
old
friend,
toiling
for?
(I
doctored
her,
when
the
beam
fell
on
her
in
the
fire).
he
thought,
looking
at
a
thin
old
woman
who
was
raking
up
the
grain,
moving
painfully
with
her
bare,
sun-blue
feet
over
the
uneven,
rough
floor.
"Then
she
recovered,
but
today
or
tomorrow
or
in
ten
years
she
won'tbe
they'll
bury
her,
and
nothing
will
be
left
either
of
her
or
of
that

girl
in
the
red
jacket,

that

he
thought,
gazing
at
the
heavily
moving,
panting
horse
that
kept
walking
up
the
wheel
that
turned
under
him.
"And
they
will
bury

He's
untying
the
shenanigans
and
giving
orders,
and
shouting
to
the
women,
and
quickly
setting
straight
the
strap
on
the
moving
wheel.
And
what's
more,
it's
not
them
alone.
they'll
bury
too,
and
nothing
will
be
left.
What
for?"
He
thought
this,
and
at
the
same
time
looked
at
his
watch
to
reckon
how
much
they
thrashed
in
an
hour.
He
wanted
to
know
this
so
as
to
judge
by
it
the
task
to
set
for
the
day.
"It'll
soon
be
one,
and
they're
only
beginning
the
third
sheafs
thought
Levin.
He
went
up
to
the
man
that
was
feeding
the
machine,
and
shouting
over
the
roar
of
the
machine
he
told
him
to
put
it
in
more
slowly.
"You
put
in
too
much

a
time,
Fyodorov

Fyodorov
black
with
the
dust
that
clung
to
his
moist
face,
shouted
something
in
response,
but
still
went
on
doing
it
as
Levin
did
not
want
him
to.
Levin,
going
up
to
the
machine,
moved
Fyodor
aside,
and
began
feeding
the
corn
in
himself.
Working
on
till
the
peasants'
dinner
hour,
which
was
not
long
in
coming,
he
went
out
of
the
barn
with
Fyodor
and
fell
into
talk
with
him,
stopping
beside
a
neat
yellow
sheaf
of
rye
laid
on
the
thrashing
floor
for
seed.
Fyodor
came
from
a
village
at
some
distance
from
the
one
in
which
Levin
had
once
allotted
land
to
his
cooperative
association.
Now
it
had
been
let
to
a
former
house
portering
Levin
talked
to
Fyodor
about
this
land
and
asked
whether
Platong
a
well-to-do
peasant
of
good
character
belonging
to
the
same
village,
would
not
take
the
land
for
the
coming
year.
"It's
a
high
rent;
it
wouldn't
pay

Dmitrin
answered
the
peasant,
picking
the
ears
off
his
sweat-soaked
shirt.
"But
how

it
pay?"
"Mix
(so
the
peasant
called
the
house

in
a
tone
of
contempt,
"you

be
sure
he'll
make

Konstantin
Dmitrin
He'll

He's
no

But
Uncle
null
(so
he
called
the
old
peasant
Platong

you

Where
there's

he'll

And
he'll
not
wring
the
last
penny
out.
He's
a
man
too."
"But
why
will
he
let
anyone
off?"'
"Oh,
well,
of
course,

are
different.
One
man
lives
for
his

and
nothing

like
Mitulski

only
thinks
of
filling
his

but
null

a
righteous
man.
He
lives
for
his
soul.
He
does
not
forget
God."
"How
thinks
of
God?
How
does
he
live
for
his
soul?"
Levin
almost
shouted.
"Why,
to
be
sure,
in
truth,
in
God's
way.
Folks
are
different.
Take
you
now,

a
man:
"Yes,
yes,
good-bye,
said
Levin,
breathless
with
excitement,
and
turning
round
he
took
his
stick
and
walked
quickly
away
towards
home.
At
the
peasant's
words
that
null
lived
for
his
soul,
in
truth,
in
God's
way,
undefined
but
significant
ideas
seemed
to
burst
out
as
though
they
had
been
locked
up,
and
all
striving
towards
one
goal,
they
thronged
whirling
through
his
head,
blinding
him
with
their
light.
Chapter
12
Levin
strode
along
the
highs
absorbed
not
so
much
in
his
thoughts
(he
could
not
yet
disentangle
them)
as
in
his
spiritual
condition,
unlike
anything
he
had
experienced
before.
The
words
uttered
by
the
peasant
had
acted
on
his
soul
like
an
electric
shock,
suddenly
transforming
and
combining
into
a
single
whole
the
whole
swarm
of
disjunction
impotent,
separate
thoughts
that
incessantly
occupied
his
mind.
These
thoughts
had
unconsciously
been
in
his
mind
even
when
he
was
talking
about
the
land.
He
was
aware
of
something
new
in
his
soul,
and
joyfully
tested
this
new
thing,
not
yet
knowing
what
it
was.
"Not
living
for
his
own
wants,
but
for
God?
For
what
God?
And
could
one
say
anything
more
senseless
than
what
he
said?
He
said
that
one
must
not
live
for
one's
own
wants,
that
is,
that
one
must
not
live
for
what
we
understand,
what
we
are
attracted
by,
what
we
desire,
but
must
live
for
something
incomprehensible,
for
God,
whom
no
one
can
understand
nor
even
define.
What
of
it?
Didn't
I
understand
those
senseless
words
of
Fyodorov
And
understanding
them,
did
I
doubt
of
their
truth?
Did
I
think
them
stupid,
obscure,
inexcusable
No,
I
understood
him,
and
exactly
as
he
understands
the
words.
I
understood
them
more
fully
and
clearly
than
I
understand
anything
in
life,
and
never
in
my
life
have
I
doubted
nor
can
I
doubt
about
it.
And
not
only
I,
but
everyone,
the
whole
world
understands
nothing
fully
but
this,
and
about
this
only
they
have
no
doubt
and
are
always
agreed.
"And
I
looked
out
for
miracles,
complained
that
I
did
not
see
a
miracle
which
would
convince
me.
A
material
miracle
would
have
persuaded
me.
And
here
is
a
miracle,
the
sole
miracle
possible,
continually
existing,
surrounding
me
on
all
sides,
and
I
never
noticed
it!
"G"

that
Kirilov.

for
his

That's
comprehensible
and
rational.
All
of
us
as
rational
beings
can't
do
anything
else
but
live
for
our
belly.
And
all
of
a
sudden
the
same
Fyodor
says
that
one
mustn't
live
for
one's
belly,
but
must
live
for
truth,
for
God,
and
at
a
hint
I
understand
him!
And

about

thing-oriented
are
all
agreed
about
this
one
thing:
what
we
must
live
for
and
what
is
good.

only

incontestable,

outside

and

and
can

"If

it
is
not

if
it
has
effects,
a
reward,
it
is
not
goodness
either.
So
goodness
is
outside
the
chain
of
cause
and
effect.
"And
yet
I
know
it,
and
we
all
know
it.
"What
could
be
a
greater
miracle
than
that?
"Can
I
have
found
the
solution
of
it
all?
can
my
sufferings
be
over?"
thought
Levin,
striding
along
the
dusty
road,
not
noticing
the
heat
nor
his
wearing
and
experiencing
a
sense
of
relief
from
prolonged
suffering.
This
feeling
was
so
delicious
that
it
seemed
to
him
incredible.
He
was
breathless
with
emotion
and
incapable
of
going
farthest
he
turned
off
the
road
into
the
forest
and
lay
down
in
the
shade
of
an
aspen
on
the
uncut
grass.
He
took
his
hat
off
his
hot
head
and
lay
propped
on
his
elbow
in
the
lush,
featly
woodland
grass.
"Yes,
I
must
make
it
clear
to
myself
and
understand,"
he
thought,
looking
intently
at
the
untranslatable
grass
before
him,
and
following
the
movements
of
a
green
beetle,
advancing
along
a
blade
of
couch-potato
and
lifting
up
in
its
progress
a
leaf
of
goat.
"What
have
I
discoverer
he
asked
himself,
bending
aside
the
leaf
of
goat.
out
of
the
beetle's
way
and
twisting
another
blade
of
grass
above
for
the
beetle
to
cross
over
onto
it.
"What
is
it
makes
me
glade
What
have
I
discovered?
"I
have
discovered
nothing.
I
have
only
found
out
what
I
knew.
I
understand
the

that
in
the
past
gave
me
life,
and
now
too
gives
me
life.
I
have
been
set
free
from
falsity.
I
have
found
the
Master.
"Of
old

used
to
say

that

of

beetle

she
didn't
care
for

wings
and
flown
away,
there
was
going
on
a
transformation
of
matter
in
accordance
with
physical,
chemical,
and
physiological
laws.
And
in
all
of
us,
as
well
as
in
the
aspens
and
the
clouds
and
the
misty
patches,
there
was
a
process
of
evolution.
Evolution
from
what?
into
whatever
evolution
and
struggle:
As
though
there
could
be
any
sort
of
tendency
and
struggle
in
the
null
And
I
was
astonished
that
in
spite
of
the
utmost
effort
of
thought
along
that
road
I
could
not
discover
the
meaning
of
life,
the
meaning
of
my
impulses
and
yearns
Now
I
say
that
I
know
the
meaning
of
my
life:
'To
live
for
God,
for
my
soul.'
And
this
meaning,
in
spite
of
its
clears
is
mysterious
and
marvelous.
Such-and-Such's
indeed,
is
the
meaning
of
everything
existing.
Yes,
pride,"
he
said
to
himself,
turning
over
on
his
stomach
and
beginning
to
tie
a
noose
of
blades
of
grass,
trying
not
to
break
them.
"And
not
merely
pride
of
intellect,
but
null
of
intellect.
And
most
of
all,
the
deceits
yes,
the
deceits
of
intellect.
The
cheating
knead
of
intellect,
that's
it,"
he
said
to
himself.
And
he
briefly
went
through,
mentally,
the
whole
course
of
his
ideas
during
the
last
two
years,
the
beginning
of
which
was
the
clear
confronting
of
death
at
the
sight
of
his
dear
brother
hopelessly
ill.
Then,
for
the
first
time,
grasping
that
for
every
man,
and
himself
too,
there
was
nothing
in
store
but
suffering,
death,
and
forgetfulness."
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
life
was
impossible
like
that,
and
that
he
must
either
interpret
life
so
that
it
would
not
present
itself
to
him
as
the
evil
jest
of
some
devil,
or
shoot
himself.
But
he
had
not
done
either,
but
had
gone
on
living,
thinking,
and
feeling,
and
had
even
at
that
very
time
married,
and
had
had
many
joys
and
had
been
happy,
when
he
was
not
thinking
of
the
meaning
of
his
life.
What
did
this
mean?
It
meant
that
he
had
been
living
rightly,
but
thinking
wrongly.
He
had
lived
(without
being
aware
of
it)
on
those
spiritual
truths
that
he
had
sucked
in
with
his
mother's
milk,
but
he
had
thought,
not
merely
without
recognition
of
these
truths,
but
studiously
ignoring
them.
Now
it
was
clear
to
him
that
he
could
only
live
by
virtue
of
the
beliefs
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up.
"What
should
I
have
been,
and
how
should
I
have
spent
my
life,
if
I
had
not
had
these
beliefs,
if
I
had
not
known
that
I
must
live
for
God
and
not
for
my
own
desires?
I
should
have
robbed
and
lied
and
killed.
Nothing
of
what
makes
the
chief
happiness
of
my
life
would
have
existed
for
me."
And
with
the
utmost
stretch
of
imagination
he
could
not
conceive
the
brutal
creature
he
would
have
been
himself,
if
he
had
not
known
what
he
was
living
for.
"I
looked
for
an
answer
to
my
question.
And
thought
could
not
give
an
answer
to
my
question-and-answer
is
incommunicable,
with
my
question.
The
answer
has
been
given
me
by
life
itself,
in
my
knowledge
of
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong.
And
that
knowledge
I
did
not
arrive
at
in
any
way,
it
was
given
to
me
as
to
all
men,
_in
because
I
could
not
have
got
it
from
anywhere.
"Where
could
I
have
got
it?
By
reason
could
I
have
arrived
at
knowing
that
I
must
love
my
neighbor
and
not
oppress
him?
I
was
told
that
in
my
childhood,
and
I
believed
it
gladly,"
for
they
told
me
what
was
already
in
my
soul.
But
who
discovered
it?
Not
reason.
Reason
discovered
the
struggle
for
existence,
and
the
law
that
requires
us
to
oppress
all
who
hinder
the
satisfaction
of
our
desires.
That
is
the
deduction
of
reason.
But
loving
one's
neighbor
reason
could
never
discover,
because
it's
irrational."
Chapter
13
And
Levin
remembered
a
scene
he
had
lately
witnessed
between
Dolly
and
her
children.
The
children,
left
to
themselves,
had
begun
cooking
raspberries
over
the
candles
and
squirts"
milk
into
each
other's
mouths
with
a
syringe.
Their
mother,
catching
them
at
these
pranks,
began
reminding
them
in
Levin's
presence
of
the
trouble
their
mischief
gave
to
the
grown-up
people,
and
that
this
trouble
was
all
for
their
sake,
and
that
if
they
smashed
the
cups
they
would
have
nothing
to
drink
their
tea
out
of,
and
that
if
they
wasted
the
milk,
they
would
have
nothing
to
eat,
and
die
of
hunger.
And
Levin
had
been
struck
by
the
passive,
weary
incredulity
with
which
the
children
heard
what
their
mother
said
to
them.
They
were
simply
annoyed
that
their
amusing
play
had
been
interrupted,
and
did
not
believe
a
word
of
what
their
mother
was
saying.
They
could
not
believe
it
indeed,
for
they
could
not
take
in
the
immensity
of
all
they
habitually
enjoyed,
and
so
could
not
conceive
that
what
they
were
destroying
was
the
very
thing
they
lived
by.
"That
all
comes
of
itself,"
they
thought,
"and
there's
nothing
interesting
or
important
about
it
because
it
has
always
been
so,
and
always
will
be
so.
And
it's
all
always
the
same.
We've
no
need
to
think
about
that,
it's
all
ready.
But
we
want
to
invent
something
of
our
own,
and
new.
So
we
thought
of
putting
raspberries
in
a
cup,
and
cooking
them
over
a
candle,
and
squirts"
milk
straight
into
each
other's
mouths.
That's
fun,
and
something
new,
and
not
a
bit
worse
than
drinking
out
of
cur
"Isn't
it
just
the
same
that
we
do,
that
I
did,
searching
by
the
aid
of
reason
for
the
significance
of
the
forces
of
nature
and
the
meaning
of
the
life
of
man?"
he
thought.
"And
don't
all
the
theories
of
philosophy
do
the
same,
trying
by
the
path
of
thought,
which
is
strange
and
not
natural
to
man,
to
bring
him
to
a
knowledge
of
what
he
has
known
long
ago,
and
knows
so
certainly
that
he
could
not
live
at
all
without
it?
Isn't
it
distinctly
to
be
seen
in
the
development
of
each
philosopher's
theory,
that
he
knows
what
is
the
chief
significance
of
life
beforehand,
just
as
positively
as
the
peasant
Fyodorov
and
not
a
bit
more
clearly
than
he,
and
is
simply
trying
by
a
dubious
intellectual
path
to
come
back
to
what
everyone
knows?
"Now
then,
leave
the
children
to
themselves
to
get
things
alone
and
make
their
crockery,
get
the
milk
from
the
cows,
and
so
on.
Would
they
be
naughty
then?
Why,
they'd
die
of
hunger,
Well,
then,
leave
us
with
our
passions
and
thoughts,
without
any
idea
of
the
one
God,
of
the
Creator.
or
without
any
idea
of
what
is
right,
without
any
idea
of
moral
evil.
"Just
try
and
build
up
anything
without
those
ideas"
"We
only
try
to
destroy
them,
because
we're
spiritually
provided
for.
Exactly
like
the
children"
"Whenever
have
I
that
joyful
knowledge,
shared
with
the
peasant,
that
alone
gives
peace
to
my
soul?"
Whence
did
I
get
it?
"Broward
up
with
an
idea
of
God,
a
Christian,
my
whole
life
filled
with
the
spiritual
blessings
Christianity
has
given
me,
full
of
them,
and
living
on
those
blessings,
like
the
children
I
did
not
understand
them,
and
destroy,
that
is
try
to
destroy,
what
I
live
by.
And
as
soon
as
an
important
moment
of
life
comes,
like
the
children
when
they
are
cold
and
hungry,
I
turn
to
Him,"
and
even
less
than
the
children
when
their
mother
scolds
them
for
their
childish
mischief,
do
I
feel
that
my
childish
efforts
at
wanton
madness
are
reckoned
against
me.
"Yes,
what
I
know,
I
know
not
by
reason,
but
it
has
been
given
to
me,
revealed
to
me,
and
I
know
it
with
my
heart,
by
faith
in
the
chief
thing
taught
by
the
church.
"The
church"
the
church"
Levin
repeated
to
himself.
He
turned
over
on
the
other
side,
and
leaning
on
his
elbow,
fell
to
gazing
into
the
distance
at
a
herd
of
cattle
crossing
over
to
the
river.
"But
can
I
believe
in
all
the
church
teaching
he
thought,
trying
himself,
and
thinking
of
everything
that
could
destroy
his
present
peace
of
mind.
Intentionally
he
recalled
all
those
doctrines
of
the
church
which
had
always
seemed
most
strange
and
had
always
been
a
stumbling
block
to
him.
"The
Creations
But
how

I
explain

The
devil

sin.
But
how

The

"But
I
know
nothing,
nothing,
and
I
can
know
nothing
but
what
has
been
told
to
me
and
all
men."
And
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
not
a
single
article
of
faith
of
the
church
which
could
destroy
the
chief
thing-oriented
in
God,
in
goodness,
as
the
one
goal
of
man's
destiny.
Under
every
article
of
faith
of
the
church
could
be
put
the
faith
in
the
service
of
truth
instead
of
one's
desires.
And
each
doctrine
did
not
simply
leave
that
faith
unshaken,
each
doctrine
seemed
essential
to
complete
that
great
miracle,
continually
manifest
upon
earth,
that
made
it
possible
for
each
man
and
millions
of
different
sorts
of
men,

men
and
imbecilic
old
men
and
children.

to
understand
perfectly
the

and
to
build
up
thereby
that
life
of
the
soul
which
alone
is
worth
living,
and
which
alone
is
precious
to
us.
Lying
on
his
back,
he
gazed
up
now
into
the
high,
cloudless
sky.
"Do
I
not
know
that
that
is
infinite

and
that
it
is
not
a

But,
however
I
screw

I
cannot

and
in

of
my

about

I

right
when
I
see
a
solid
blue
dome,
and
more
right
than
when
I
strain
my
eyes
to

it."
Levin
ceased
thinking,
and
only,
as
it
were,
listened
to
mysterious
voices
that
seemed
talking
joyfully
and
earnestly
within
him.
"Can
this
be
faithful
he
thought,
afraid
to
believe
in
his
happiness.
"My
God,
I
thank
Thee,"
he
said,
gulping
down
his
sobs,
and
with
both
hands
brushing
away
the
tears
that
filled
his
eyes.
Chapter
14
Levin
looked
before
him
and
saw
a
herd
of
cattle,
then
he
caught
sight
of
his
trap
with
Raven
in
the
shafts,
and
the
coachman,
who,
driving
up
to
the
herd,
said
something
to
the
herdsmen
Then
he
heard
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
and
the
snort
of
the
sleek
horse
close
by
him.
But
he
was
so
buried
in
his
thoughts
that
he
did
not
even
wonder
why
the
coachman,
had
come
for
him.
He
only
thought
of
that
when
the
coachman,
had
driven
quite
up
to
him
and
shouted
to
him.
"The
mistress
sent
me.
Your
brother
has
come,
and
some
gentleman
with
him."
Levin
got
into
the
trap
and
took
the
reins.
As
though
just
roused
out
of
sleep,
for
a
long
while
Levin
could
not
collect
his
faculties.
He
stared
at
the
sleek
horse
flecked
with
lather
between
his
haunches
and
on
his
neck,
where
the
harness
rubbed,
stared
at
Ivan
the
coachman,
sitting
beside
him,
and
remembered
that
he
was
expecting
his
brother,
thought
that
his
wife
was
most
likely
uneasy
at
his
long
absence,
and
tried
to
guess
who
was
the
visitor
who
had
come
with
his
brother.
And
his
brother
and
his
wife
and
the
unknown
guest
seemed
to
him
now
quite
different
from
before.
He
fancied
that
now
his
relations
with
all
men
would
be
different.
"With
my
brother
there
will
be
none
of
that
aloofness
there
always
used
to
be
between
us,
there
will
be
no
disputing
with
Kitty
there
shall
never
be
quarrelsome
with
the
visitor,
whoever
he
may
be,
I
will
be
friendly
and
nicely
with
the
servants,
with
Ivan,
it
will
all
be
different."
Pulling
the
stiff
rein
and
holding
in
the
good
horse
that
snorted
with
impatience
and
seemed
begging
to
be
let
go,
Levin
looked
round
at
Ivan
sitting
beside
him,
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
his
unoccupied
hand,
continually
pressing
down
his
shirt
as
it
puffed
out,
and
he
tried
to
find
something
to
start
a
conversation
about
with
him.
He
would
have
said
that
Ivan
had
pulled
the
saddle-shaped
up
too
high,
but
that
was
like
blame,
and
he
longed
for
friendly,
warm
talk.
Nothing
else
occurred
to
him.
"Your
honor
must
keep
to
the
right
and
mind
that
stump-dump
said
the
coachman,
pulling
the
rein
Levin
held.
"Please
don't
touch
and
don't
teach
me!"
said
Levin,
angered
by
this
interference.
Now,
as
always,
interference
made
him
angry,
and
he
felt
sorrowfully
at
once
how
mistaken
had
been
his
supposition
that
his
spiritual
condition
could
immediately
change
him
in
contact
with
reality.
He
was
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
home
when
he
saw
Grisham
and
Tanya
running
to
meet
him.
"Uncle
Kostyra,
mammal
coming,
and
grandfather,
and
Sergey
Ivanovo.
and
someone
else,"
they
said,
clambering
up
into
the
trap.
"Who
is
he?"
"An
awfully
terrible
person"
And
he
does
like
this
with
his
arms,"
said
Tanya,
getting
up
in
the
trap
and
mimicking

"Old
or
young?"
asked
Levin,
laughing,

of

did
not
know

Tanya,

"Oh,
I
hope
it's
not
a
tiresome
person"
thought
Levin.
As
soon
as
he
turned,
at
a
bend
in
the
road,
and
saw
the
party
coming,
Levin
recognized
Katawazi
in
a
straw
hat,
walking
along
swinging
his
arms
just
as
Tanya
had
shown
him.
Katawazi
was
very
fond
of
discussing
metaphysics.
having
derived
his
notions
from
natural
science
writers
who
had
never
studied
metaphysics.
and
in
Moscow
Levin
had
had
many
arguments
with
him
of
late.
And
one
of
these
arguments,
in
which
Katawazi
had
obviously
considered
that
he
came
off
victorious,
was
the
first
thing
Levin
thought
of
as
he
recognized
him.
"No,
whatever
I
do,
I
won't
argue
and
give
utterance
to
my
ideas
lightly,"
he
thought.
Getting
out
of
the
trap
and
greeting
his
brother
and
Katawazi
Levin
asked
about
his
wife.
"She
has
taken
Mityunov
to
Kolokoff
(a
copse's
near
the
house,
"She
meant
to
have
him
out
there
because
it's
so
hot
indoors,"
said
Dolly.
Levin
had
always
advised
his
wife
not
to
take
the
baby
to
the
wood,
thinking
it
unsafe,
and
he
was
not
pleased
to
hear
this.
"She
rushes
about
from
place
to
place
with
him,"
said
the
prince,
smiling.
"I
advised
her
to
try
putting
him
in
the
ice
cellar."
"She
meant
to
come
to
the
bee
house.
She
thought
you
would
be
there.
We
are
going
there,"
said
Dolly.
"Well,
and
what
are
you
doing?"
said
Sergey
Ivanovo.
falling
back
from
the
rest
and
walking
beside
him.
"Oh,
nothing
special.
Busy
as
usual
with
the
land,"
answered
Levin.
"Well,
and
what
about
you?
Come
for
long?
We
have
been
expecting
you
for
such
a
long
time."
"Only
for
a
fortnight.
I've
a
great
deal
to
do
in
Moscow."
At
these
words
the
brothers'
eyes
met,
and
Levin,
in
spite
of
the
desire
he
always
had,
stronger
than
ever
just
now,
to
be
on
affectionate
and
still
more
open
terms
with
his
brother,
felt
an
awkwardness
in
looking
at
him.
He
dropped
his
eyes
and
did
not
know
what
to
say.
Casting
over
the
subjects
of
conversation
that
would
be
pleasant
to
Sergey
Ivanovo.
and
would
keep
him
off
the
subject
of
the
Service
war
and
the
Slavonic
question,
at
which
he
had
hinted
by
the
allusion
to
what
he
had
to
do
in
Moscow,
Levin
began
to
talk
of
Sergey

"Well,
have
there
been
reviews
of

he
asked.
Sergey

smiled
at
the
intentional
character
of
the
question.
"No
one
is
interested
in
that
now,
and
I
less
than
anyone,"
he
said.
"Just
look,
Darya
Alexei

shall

he
added,
pointing
with
a
sunshine
at
the

that
showed
above
the
aspen

And
these
words
were
enough
to
re-establish
again
between
the
brothers
that
tone-changes
hostile,
but
chilly.
Levin
had
been
so
longing
to
avoid.
Levin
went
up
to
Katawazi
"It
was
jolly
of
you
to
make
up
your
mind
to
come,"
he
said
to
him.
"I've
been
meaning
to
a
long
while.
Now
we
shall
have
some
discussion,
we'll
see
to
that.
Have
you
been

Spencers
"No,
I've
not
finished
reading
him,"
said
Levin.
"But
I
don't
need
him
now."
"How's
that?
that's
interesting.
Why
so?"
"I
mean
that
I'm
fully
convinced
that
the
solution
of
the
problems
that
interest
me
I
shall
never
find
in
him
and
his
like.
Now:
But
Katawazi
serene
and
good-humored
expression
suddenly
struck
him,
and
he
felt
such
tenderness
for
his
own
happy
mood,
which
he
was
unmistakably
disturbing
by
this
conversation,
that
he
remembered
his
resolution
and
stopped
short.
"But
we'll
talk
later
on,"
he
added.
"If
we're
going
to
the
bee
house,
it's
this
way,
along
this
little
path,"
he
said,
addressing
them
all.
Going
along
the
narrow
path
to
a
little
uncut
meadow
covered
on
one
side
with
thick
clumps
of
brilliant
heart,
among
which
stood
up
here
and
there
tall,
dark
green
tufts
of
hellebores
Levin
settled
his
guests
in
the
dense,
cool
shade
of
the
young
aspens
on
a
bench
and
some
stumps
purposely
put
there
for
visitors
to
the
bee
house
who
might
be
afraid
of
the
bees,
and
he
went
off
himself
to
the
hut
to
get
bread,
cucumbers,
and
fresh
honey,
to
regale
them
with.
Trying
to
make
his
movements
as
deliberate
as
possible,
and
listening
to
the
bees
that
buzzed
more
and
more
frequently
past
him,
he
walked
along
the
little
path
to
the
hut.
In
the
very
entry
one
bee
hummed
angrily,
caught
in
his
beard,
but
he
carefully
extricated
it.
Going
into
the
shady
outer
room,
he
took
down
from
the
wall
his
veil,
that
hung
on
a
null
and
putting
it
on,
and
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
pockets,
he
went
into
the
fenced-in
bee-keeping,
where
there
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
closely
mown
space
in
regular
rows,
fastened
with
bastard
on
posts,
all
the
hives
he
knew
so
well,
the
old
stocks,
each
with
its
own
history,
and
along
the
fences
the
younger
swarms
hived
that
year.
In
front
of
the
openings
of
the
hives,
it
made
his
eyes
giddy
to
watch
the
bees
and
drones
whirling
round
and
round
about
the
same
spot,
while
among
them
the
working
bees
flew
in
and
out
with
spoils
or
in
search
of
them,
always
in
the
same
direction
into
the
wood
to
the
flowering
lime
trees
and
back
to
the
hives.
His
ears
were
filled
with
the
incessant
hum
in
various
notes,
now
the
busy
hum
of
the
working
bee
flying
quickly
off,
then
the
blaring
of
the
lazy
drone.
and
the
excited
buzz
of
the
bees
on
guard
protecting
their
property
from
the
enemy
and
preparing
to
sting.
On
the
farther
side
of
the
fence
the
old
bee-keeping,
was
shaving
a
hoop
for
a
tub,
and
he
did
not
see
Levin.
Levin
stood
still
in
the
midst
of
the
beek-International
and
did
not
call
him.
He
was
glad
of
a
chance
to
be
alone
to
recover
from
the
influence
of
ordinary
actual
life,
which
had
already
depressed
his
happy
mood.
He
thought
that
he
had
already
had
time
to
lose
his
temper
with
Ivan,
to
show
coolness
to
his
brother,
and
to
talk
flippantly
with
Katawazi
"Can
it
have
been
only
a
momentary
mood,
and
will
it
pass
and
leave
no
traceable
he
thought.
But
the
same
instant,
going
back
to
his
mood,
he
felt
with
delight
that
something
new
and
important
had
happened
to
him.
Real
life
had
only
for
a
time
overcast
the
spiritual
peace
he
had
found,
but
it
was
still
untouched
within
him.
Just
as
the
bees,
whirling
round
him,
now
menacing
him
and
distracting
his
attention,
prevented
him
from
enjoying
complete
physical
peace,
forced
him
to
restrain
his
movements
to
avoid

he
said
something
else.
"You
don't
put
the

in
its

light.
There
is
no
question
here
of
a
declaration
of
war,
but
simply
the
expression
of
a
human
Christian
feeling.

to
inquire
whether
war
had
been

would
throw
yourself
on

protect
the

"But
I
should
not

said
Levin.
"Yes,
you

"I
don't

If
I
saw
that,
I
might
give

to
my

I
can't

Levin
timidly.
"The

and
are

to
make

not
for

he
added,
instinctively
connecting
the

with
the

that
had
been
absorbing
his

"For

That's
a
most
puzzling
expression

you

rejoined
for
his
part,
quoting
as
simply
as
though
it
were
the
easiest
thing
to
understand
the
very
passage
that
had
always
puzzled
Levin
most.
"That's
so,
no
doubt,"
the
old
man
repeated
again.
He
was
standing
near
them
and
responded
to
a
chance
glance
turned
in
his
direction.
"Ah,
my
dear
fellow,
you're
defeated,
utterly
defeated"
cried
Katawazi

Levin
reddened
with
vexatious
not
at
being
defeated,
but
at
having
failed
to
control
himself
and
being
drawn
into
argument.
"No,
I
can't
argue
with
them,"
he
thought;
"they
wear
impenetrable
armor,
while
I'm
naked:
He
saw
that
it
was
impossible
to
convince
his
brother
and
Katawazi
and
he
saw
even
less
possibility
of
himself
agreeing
with
them.
What
they
advocated
was
the
very
pride
of
intellect
that
had
almost
been
his
ruin.
He
could
not
admit
that
some
dozens
of
men,
among
them
his
brother,
had
the
right,
on
the
ground
of
what
they
were
told
by
some
hundreds
of
glib
volunteers
swarming
to
the
capital,
to
say
that
they
and
the
newspapers
were
expressing
the
will
and
feeling
of
the
people,
and
a
feeling
which
was
expressed
in
vengeance
and
murder.
He
could
not
admit
this,
because
he
neither
saw
the
expression
of
such
feelings
in
the
people
among
whom
he
was
living,
nor
found
them
in
himself
(and
he
could
not
but
consider
himself

when
there
was
a
sudden
flash,
the
whole
earth
seemed
on

and
the
vault

seemed
crashing
overhead.
Opening

gazed

the

vanished
behind
the

and
he
heard
the
crash
of
the

upon
the
others.
The
flash
of

the
crash
of

and
the

that
ran
through

were
all
merged
for
Levin

terror.

he
said.
And

at

how

that

not

been
killed
by
the
oak
which
had
fallen
now,
he
repeated
it,
knowing
that
he
could
do
nothing
better
than
utter
this
senseless
prayer.
Running
up
to
the
place
where
they
usually
went,
he
did
not

Two

part

but
Kitty
was
drenched

and
her

to

Though

up
to

smiled

"Aren't

I
can't

said
angrily
to

"It

beside

he
squeezed
her
hand
when

was
not

During
the

of

day,
in
the
extremely
different
conversations
in
which
he
took
part,
only
as
it
were
with
the
top
layer
of
his
mind,
in
spite
of
the
disappointment
of
not
finding
the
change
he
expected
in
himself,
Levin
had
been
all
the
while
joyfully
conscious
of
the
fulsome
of
his
heart.
After

it
was

too,
was
in

spirits,
and
at
tea
his
brother
drew
him
on
to
explain
his
views
of
the
future
of
the
Eastern
question,
and
he
spoke
so
simply
and
so
well,
that
everyone
listened
eagerly.
Kitty

summoned
to

A
few
minutes
after
Kitty
had
left
the
room
she
sent
for
Levin
to
come
to
the
nursery.
Leaving
his
tea,
and
regretfully
interrupting
the
interesting
conversation,
and
at
the
same
time
uneasily
wondering
why
he
had
been
sent
for,
as
this
only
happened
on
important
occasions,
Levin
went
to
the
nursery.
Although
he
had
been
much
interested
by
Sergey

views
of
the
new
epoch
in
history
that
would
be
created
by
the
emancipation
of
forty
millions
of
men
of
Slavonic
race
acting
with
Russia,
a
conception
quite
new
to
him,
and
although
he
was
disturbed
by
uneasy
wonder
at
being
sent
for
by
Kitty,
as
soon
as
he
came
out
of
the
drawing
room
and
was
alone,
his
mind
reverted
at
once
to
the
thoughts
of
the
morning.
And
all
the
theories
of
the
significance
of
the
Slav
element
in
the
history
of
the
world
seemed
to
him
so
trivial
compared
with
what
was
passing
in
his
own
soul,
that
he
instantly
forgot
it
all
and
dropped
back
into
the
same
frame
of
mind
that
he
had
been
in
that
morning.
He
did
not,
as
he
had
done
at
other
times,
recall
the
whole
train
of
thought-bubble
he
did
not
need.
He
fell
back
at
once
into
the
feeling
which
had
guided
him,
which
was
connected
with
those
thoughts,
and
he
found
that
feeling
in
his
soul
even
stronger
and
more
definite
than
before.
He
did
not,
as
he
had
had
to
do
with
previous
attempts
to
find
comforting
arguments,
need
to
revive
a
whole
chain
of
thought
to
find
the
feeling.
Now,
on
the
contrary,
the
feeling
of
joy
and
peace
was
keener
than
ever,
and
thought
could
not
keep
pace
with
feeling.
He
walked
across
the
terrace
and
looked
at
two
stars
that
had
come
out
in
the
darkening
sky,
and
suddenly
he
remembered.
"Yes,
looking
at
the
sky,
I
thought
that
the
dome
that
I
see
is
not
a
deception,
and
then
I
thought
something,
I
shirked
facing
something,"
he
mused.
"But
whatever
it
was,
there
can
be
no
disproving
it!
I
have
but
to
think,
and
all
will
come
clear"
Just
as
he
was
going
into
the
nursery
he
remembered
what
it
was
he
had
shirked
facing.
It
was
that
if
the
chief
proof
of
the
Divinity
was
His
revelation
of
what
is
right,
how
is
it
this
revelation
is
confined
to
the
Christian
church
alone?
What
relation
to
this
revelation
have
the
beliefs
of
the
Buddhists,
Mohammedi
who
preached
and
did
good
too?
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
an
answer
to
this
question;
but
he
had
not
time
to
formulate
it
to
himself
before
he
went
into
the
nursery.
Kitty
was
standing
with
her
sleeves
tucked
up
over
the
baby
in
the
bath.
Hearing
her
husband's
footsteps
she
turned
towards
him,
summoning
him
to
her
with
her
smile.
With
one
hand
she
was
supporting
the
fat
baby
that
lay
floating
and
sprawling
on
its
back,
while
with
the
other
she
squeezed
the
sponge
over
him.
"Come,
look,
look!"
she
said,
when
her
husband
came
up
to
her.
"Again,
Mihalowski
right.
He
knows
us!"
Mityunov
had
on
that
day
given
unmistakable.
incontestable
signs
of
recognizing
all
his
friends.
As
soon
as
Levin
approached
the
bath,
the
experiment
was
tried,
and
it
was
completely
successful.
The
cook,
sent
for
with
this
object,
bent
over
the
baby.
He
frowned
and
shook
his
head
disapprovingly.
Kitty
bent
down
to
him,
he
gave
her
a
beaming
smile,
propped
his
little
hands
on
the
sponge
and
chirruping
making
such
a
queer,
little
contented
sound
with
his
lips,
that
Kitty
and
the
nurse
were
not
alone
in
their
admiration.
Levin,
too,
was
surprised
and
delighted.
The
baby
was
taken
out
of
the
bath,
drenched
with
water,
wrapped
in
towels,
dried,
and
after
a
piercing
scream,
handed
to
his
mother.
"Well,
I
am
glad
you
are
beginning
to
love
him,"
said
Kitty
to
her
husband,
when
she
had
settled
herself
comfortably
in
her
usual
place,
with
the
baby
at
her
breast.
"I
am
so
glade
It
had
begun
to
distress
me.
You
said
you
had
no
feeling
for
him."
"Nobel
did
I
say
that?
I
only
said
I
was
disappointed."
"What's
disappointed
in
him?"
"Not
disappointed
in
him,
but
in

own

I
had
expected

Chapter
19
Going
out
of
the
nursery
and
being
again
alone,
Levin
went
back
at
once
to
the
thought,
in
which
there
was
something
not
clear.
Instead
of
going
into
the
drawing
room,
where
he
heard
voices,
he
stopped
on
the
terrace,
and
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
parapet.
he
gazed
up
at
the
sky.
It
was
quite
dark
now,
and
in
the
south,
where
he
was
looking,
there
were
no
clouds.
The
storm
had
drifted
on
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
sky,
and
there
were
flashes
of
lightning
and
distant
thunder
from
that
quarter.
Levin
listened
to
the
monotonous
drip
from
the
lime
trees
in
the
garden,
and
looked
at
the
triangle
of
stars
he
knew
so
well,
and
the
Milky
Way
with
its
branches
that
ran
through
its
midst.
At
each
flash
of
lightning
the
Milky
Way,
and
even
the
bright
stars,
vanished,
but
as
soon
as
the
lightning
died
away,
they
reappeared
in
their
places
as
though
some
hand
had
flung
them
back
with
careful
aim.
"Well,
what
is
it
perplexing
me?"
Levin
said
to
himself,
feeling
beforehand
that
the
solution
of
his
difficulties
was
ready
in
his
soul,
though
he
did
not
know
it
yet.
"Yes,

and
words.
"Don't
I
know
that
the
stars
don't
move?"
he
asked
himself,
gazing
at
the
bright
planet
which
had
shifted
its
position
up
to
the
topmost
twig
of
the
birch.
"But
looking
at
the
movements
of
the
stars,
I
can't
picture
to
myself
the
rotation
of
the
earth,
and
I'm
right
in
saying
that
the
stars
move.
"And
could
the
astronomers
have
understood
and
calculated
anything,
if
they
had
taken
into
account
all
the
complicated
and
varied
motions
of
the
earth?"
All
the
marvelous
conclusions
they
have
reached
about
the
distances,
weights,
movements,
and
deflector
of
the
heavenly
bodies
are
only
founded
on
the
apparent
motions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
about
a
stationary
earth,
on
that
very
motion
I
see
before
me
now,
which
has
been
so
for
millions
of
men
during
long
ages,
and
was
and
will
be
always
alike,
and
can
always
be
trusted.
And
just
as
the
conclusions
of
the
astronomers
would
have
been
vain
and
uncertain
if
not
founded
on
observations
of
the
seen
heavens,
in
relation
to
a
single
meridian
and
a
single
horizon,
so
would
my
conclusions
be
vain
and
uncertain
if
not
founded
on
that
conception
of
right,
which
has
been
and
will
be
always
alike
for
all
men,
which
has
been
revealed
to
me
as
a
Christian,
and
which
can
always
be
trusted
in
my
soul.
The
question
of
other
religions
and
their
relations
to
Divinity
I
have
no
right

no

"Oh,
you
haven't
gone
in
then?"
he
heard
Kitty,
voice
all
at
once,
as
she
came
by
the
same
way
to
the
drawing-rooms.
"What
is
it?
you're
not
worried
about
anything?"
she
said,
looking
intently
at
his
face
in
the
starlight.
But
she
could
not
have
seen
his
face
if
a
flash
of
lightning
had
not
hidden
the
stars
and
revealed
it.
In
that
flash
she
saw
his
face
distinctly.
and
seeing
him
calm
and
happy,
she
smiled
at
him.
"She
understands,"
he
thought;
"she
knows
what
I'm
thinking
about.
Shall
I
tell
her
or
not?
Yes,
I'll
tell
her."
But
at
the
moment
he
was
about
to
speak,
she
began
speaking.
"Kotch"
do
something
for
me,"
she
said;
"go
into
the
corner
room
and
see
if
they've
made
it
all
right
for
Sergey
Ivanovo.
I
can't
very
well.
See
if
they've
put
the
new
wash
stand
in
it."
"Very
well,
I'll
go
directly,"
said
Levin,
standing
up
and
kissing
her.
"No,
I'd
better
not
speak
of
it,"
he
thought,
when
she
had
gone
in
before
him.
"It
is
a
secret
for
me
alone,
of
vital
importance
for
me,
and
not
to
be
put
into
words.
"This
new
feeling
has
not
changed
me,
has
not
made
me
happy
and
enlightened
all
of
a
sudden,
as
I
had
dreamed,
just
like
the
feeling
for
my
child.
There
was
no
surprise
in
this
either.
Faith.

know
what
it
isue.
this
feeling
has
come
just
as
imperceptibly
through
suffering,
and
has
taken
firm
root
in
my
soul.
"I
shall
go
on
in
the
same
way,
losing
my
temper
with
Ivan
the
coachman,
falling
into
angry
discussions,
expressing
my
opinions
tad
there
will
be
still
the
same
wall
between
the
holy
of
holiest
of
my
soul
and
other
people,
even
my
wife;
I
shall
still
go
on
scolding
her
for
my
own
terror,
and
being
remorseful
for
it;
I
shall
still
be
as
unable
to
understand
with
my
reason
why
I
pray,
and
I
shall
still
go
on
prays
but
my
life
now,
my
whole
life
apart
from
anything
that
can
happen
to
me,
every
minute
of
it
is
no
more
meaningless,
as
it
was
before,
but
it
has
the
positive
meaning
of
goodness,
which
I
have
the
power
to
put
into
it."

all
of
which
are
confirmed
as

notice
is
included.
Thus,
we
do
not
necessarily
keep
eCRM
in

any
particular
